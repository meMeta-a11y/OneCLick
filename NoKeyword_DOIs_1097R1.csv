ReCET has demonstrated a positive effect on glycaemia. In this study, a single ReCET procedure was combined with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) with the goal of eliminating insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). At 12 months 86% of patients remained off insulin. Here we report the longer-term efficacy and safety of ReCET combined with GLP-1RA over 24 months. Methods: This was a first-in-human study in patients with T2D on basal insulin (28-75 years of age; body mass index, 24-40 kg/m2; hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], ≤64 mmol/mol; C-peptide, ≥0.2 nmol/L). All of the patients underwent ReCET, after which insulin was discontinued and semaglutide (GLP-1RA) was initiated. The follow-up was extended to 24 months for initial responders (off insulin and HbA1c ≤58 mmol/mol at 12 months). Primary end points were number of responders (efficacy) and number of adverse events, serious adverse events, and hypoglycemic events (safety). Secondary end points included glycemic, metabolic, and cardiovascular parameters, and treatment satisfaction scores. Results: Fourteen patients underwent endoscopic ReCET. Eleven initial responders completed the 24-month follow-up, of which 1 withdrew consent after 18 months. All patients remained off insulin with adequate glycemic control. No procedure-related serious adverse events or severe hypoglycemic events were observed during 24 months of follow-up. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and liver fat percentage improved significantly compared with baseline. Conclusions: These results suggest that duodenal ReCET combined with semaglutide is durable, allowing insulin elimination up to 24 months, and appears safe. Glycemic control was maintained, and metabolic health improved during the 24-month follow-up period. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004889297,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that the oxygen links in bcpb2− may act as hinges, allowing for extended and folded conformations of the ligand. The resulting complexes show excellent structural stability over a wide pH range. The chain polymer 1 and the 2D networks 2 and 3 are promising luminescence sensors for Cu2+ ions with ‘turn-off’ behaviour in aqueous solution. The limit of detection for 1 is as low as 6.0 nM and thus superior to other fluorescent sensors based on metal complexes. Interestingly, 1 may also be used to sensitize Tb3+ cations with ‘turn on’ performance and exhibits good anti-interference to other lanthanide cations. As a dual-sensor, it shows good recyclability and structural stability after the sensing experiments. The possible mechanism for fluorescence quenching by Cu2+ and enhancement by Tb3+ was investigated with powder diffraction, fluorescence lifetime experiments, and infrared, UV–Vis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004044434,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Nearly half of patients undergoing ablation relapse within one year. Therefore, triggered activities may not be the only cause. Inflammation is quite common in AF. In this study, we investigated the effect of PIV, an inflammatory marker, on recurrence. Methods: A total of 157 patients who underwent ablation with cryo balloon were included in the study. One-year follow-up was evaluated for causes of recurrence. Results: When the inflammatory parameters between the two groups are analyzed, CRP (5.9 [5.0–6.9] vs 9.7 [7.6–11.9], p < 0.001), NL ratio (2.8 [2.5–3.0] vs 6.4 [5.0–6.8], p < 0.001), SII2 (618.5 [557.1–679.9] vs 1798.9 [1305.8–2292.1], p < 0.001), PIV (355.9 [313.4–398.4] vs 1832 [1317.8–2347.1], p < 001) were significantly higher in the AF recurrence group. ROC analysis showed that PIV had the best sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Inflammation has been found to be a cause of AF recurrence and PIV is one of the best markers for this. © 2024 Indian Heart Rhythm Society",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000433301,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Glucocorticoids are used in its treatment at high doses at frequent intervals, causing side effects that reduce the life standard of the patients. In this study, three types of nanoparticles that include chitosan (CS) and/or sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) and/or hyaluronic acid (HA) were developed by choosing hydrocortisone (HC) as a representative model drug of glucocorticoids. Formulation optimization studies were carried out by Box-Behnken experimental design, CS:TPP, CS:HA and CS:TPP:HA nanoparticles were prepared by using chitosan solution at pH 3. CS:TPP and CS:HA ratios were chosen as 2:1 and 0.5:1, stirring time and stirring rate were adjusted to 35 min and 1000 rpm, respectively. The particle sizes of CS:TPP, CS:HA and CS:TPP:HA formulations were found as 320.9 ± 25.9, 204.4 ± 10.6, 302.5 ± 28.2 nm and zeta potentials as 28.5 ± 0.611, −14.6 ± 2.01, −17.7 ± 0.305 mV, respectively. As a result of in vitro release studies, CS:TPP:HA formulation released the least HC at the end of 24 h at pH 7.4, which represents blood and healthy synovial fluid pH, higher HC release was provided in acidic pH representing inflamed tissue environment. The particle size of CS:TPP:HA nanoparticles didn't change significantly at pH 7.4, during in vitro stability studies. 6-month-stability study results showed that CS:TPP:HA was stable at 4 °C and 25° ± 60 % relative humidity, and cytotoxicity tests showed that it was noncytotoxic. To conclude, CS:TPP:HA nanoparticles are the most promising formulation among the three different nanoparticles that were suggested for rheumatoid arthritis treatment as a pH sensitive drug carrier. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008449169,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Arra M.; Mozelewski-Hill S.; Kaser T.; Ancona R.; Asaro P.; Holthaus C.,Comparison of Initial Lactate Levels and Their Prognostic Utility in Obese and Nonobese Patients with Sepsis,2025,Journal of Emergency Medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2025.05.023,"Background: Sepsis is a high morbidity and mortality disease that is highly prevalent in emergency departments (EDs). Lactate is often utilized as a biomarker for sepsis, though its performance among subgroups such as obese patients is not well characterized. Given existing data on differences in lactate metabolism at baseline between obese and nonobese patients, this may be clinically relevant in sepsis identification and prognostication. Study Objective: We sought to compare differences in initial lactate measurements and lactate utility in predicting 30-day mortality between obese and nonobese body mass index (BMI) patients with vasopressor-dependent and non-vasopressor-dependent sepsis. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of obese and nonobese patients presenting to an adult hospital ED with sepsis with organ dysfunction. Patients were separated into vasopressor-dependent or non-vasopressor-dependent groups. The primary outcomes were differences in initial lactate and utility of initial lactate in predicting 30-day all-cause mortality by employing receiver operator characteristic curves. Results: Obese patients had lower initial lactate (2.2 mmol/L) compared with nonobese patients (2.4 mmol/L) in the non-vasopressor-dependent cohort. Lactate performed poorly-to-moderately well as a biomarker for 30-day mortality between obese and nonobese patients with sepsis, with no differences between BMI groups. Conclusion: Initial lactate levels are lower in obese patients compared with nonobese patients, but are unlikely to be clinically significant. We found no difference in lactate's utility as a biomarker for prediction of 30-day all-cause mortality between obese and nonobese patients. Lactate overall maintains some utility as a predictor of sepsis mortality, though factors that contribute to lactate levels remain unclear. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009837190,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: From the prospective observational cohort study using data from the UK Biobank between March 13, 2006, and August 31, 2017, a total of 32,281 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and higher and urine albumin to creatinine ratio below 30 mg/g (cohort 1) and 3339 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or urine albumin to creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g and higher (cohort 2), all with baseline plasma FGF21 measurements, were included. The primary predictor was plasma FGF21 levels measured by proximity extension assay. The primary outcomes were incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) for cohort 1 and incident kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT) for cohort 2. Results: In cohort 1, 804 (5.6%) participants experienced the CKD outcome during a median 13.7 years of follow-up. A cause-specific competing model revealed adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs of 1.01 (0.88 to 1.17), 1.01 (0.87 to 1.17), and 1.25 (1.08 to 1.44) for Q2 to Q4 compared with Q1 (Ptrend=.002). In cohort 2, 83 (2.5%) participants had KFRT during a median 13.7 years of follow-up. Elevated FGF21 levels were similarly associated with a higher KFRT risk, with adjusted hazard ratios of 2.79 (0.97 to 8.05), 3.91 (1.44 to 10.66), and 3.81 (1.44 to 10.08) for Q2 to Q4 (Ptrend=.01). Subgroup analysis revealed stronger association in non-CKD participants with obesity and dyslipidemia, whereas for CKD participants, this association was stronger in those with increased inflammatory markers. Conclusion: Higher FGF21 levels correlated with heightened risks of adverse kidney outcomes in individuals with and without CKD. However, the metabolic abnormalities potentially influencing this association varied according to baseline kidney function. © 2024 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009698811,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

AD involves isoforms, proteolytic products, and posttranslationally modified proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and microtubule-associated protein tau. Top-down proteomics directly measures these species and thus, offers a comprehensive view of pathologically relevant proteoforms that are difficult to analyze using traditional proteomic techniques. Here, we broadly explored associations between proteoforms and clinicopathological traits of AD by deploying a quantitative top-down proteomics approach across frontal cortex of 103 subjects selected from the ROS and MAP cohorts. The approach identified 1213 proteins and 11,782 proteoforms, of which 154 proteoforms had at least one significant association with a clinicopathological phenotype. One important finding included identifying Aβ C-terminal truncation state as the key property for differential association between amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Furthermore, various N-terminally truncated forms of Aβ had noticeably stronger association with amyloid plaques and global cognitive function. Additionally, we discovered six VGF neuropeptides that were positively associated with cognitive function independent of pathological burden. The database of brain cortex proteoforms provides a valuable context for functional characterization of the proteins involved in AD and other late-onset brain pathologies. © 2025 THE AUTHORS.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010574199,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Meeke S.D.; Weemer M.M.,Diabetes medication prescribing trends based on provider type and location in the United States,2025,Preventive Medicine Reports,10.1016/j.pmedr.2024.102947,"Background: As primary care physician numbers continue to decline, more patients with type 2 diabetes are likely to receive care from advanced practice providers (APPs), including physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Analyzing diabetes medication prescribing trends among these provider types is essential for ensuring evidence-based diabetes care. Purpose: This retrospective, cross-sectional pilot study aimed to examine differences in type 2 diabetes medication prescribing trends by provider type (physicians vs. APPs) and geographic location, utilizing National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data. Methods: Data from the NAMCS were collected in August 2022 for the years 2015, 2016, 2018 and analyzed using IBM SPSS, employing chi-square analysis to assess associations between provider type, geographic location, and prescribed medications. Frequency distributions were calculated for patient characteristics and provider types. Results: Patients prescribed at least one diabetes medication (N = 1444) were included. Most received care from physicians (93.7 %) in metropolitan areas (82.8 %). Statistically significant associations were found between provider type, geographical location, and medications prescribed. Nurse practitioners were more likely to prescribe newer diabetes medications, while physician assistants frequently prescribed basal insulin. Patients in non-metropolitan statistical areas were more often prescribed older medications, whereas those in the West were less likely to receive older medications. Conclusions: The study revealed distinct prescribing patterns by provider type and geographic location. Notably, APPs tended to prescribe newer or specific medications in certain locations, highlighting the influence of provider type and geography on diabetes care. Further studies should include larger samples of APPs to deepen insights into these trends. © 2024",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212338473,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, recurrence has been observed in this patient group. Therefore, this study aimed to identify recurrence and prognostic factors in patients with pathologic T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who were treated with surgery alone. Methods: Of the 532 patients who underwent esophagectomy with R0 resection at Hiroshima University Hospital between August 2003 and November 2018, 124 who underwent only esophagectomy and had pathological T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were included in the study. Recurrence and prognostic factors were analyzed and details of recurrence were evaluated. Results: The 5-year recurrence-free survival and 5-year overall survival rates were 84.7% and 87.2%, respectively. Recurrence was observed in 12 (9.7%) patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the histologic type (poorly differentiated compared with others) and lymphatic and/or vascular invasion (positive compared with negative) were statistically significant for recurrence-free survival. Kaplan–Meier curves for recurrence-free survival and overall survival showed that prognosis was significantly stratified according to these factors. All patients with poorly differentiated and positive lymphatic and/or vascular invasion experienced recurrence and recurrence pattern is all distant metastases. Conclusions: Poorly differentiated and lymphatic and/or vascular invasion are important recurrence and prognostic predictors in pathologic T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with surgery alone. Patients with these prognostic factors experienced increased recurrence rates, often with distant metastasis. Therefore, adjuvant therapy may be beneficial for such patients and follow-ups should be performed at closer intervals. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206618614,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Study Design: We developed an electronic clinical quality measure for postoperative respiratory failure on the basis of input from clinical and quality experts. Using 2022 structured electronic health record data from 12 diverse hospitals encompassing 2 common electronic health record vendors, we retrospectively evaluated criteria for postoperative respiratory failure after an operation during an elective hospitalization. We sampled all denominator-eligible cases meeting postoperative respiratory failure criteria, and a subset that did not, from each center. Trained nurse abstractors reviewed medical records using a standard instrument. We assessed the positive and negative predictive value of the measure (with 95% confidence intervals), and the discrimination and calibration of its risk model. Results: Among 95 records flagged by the measure and 310 denominator-eligible records not flagged, the postoperative respiratory failure electronic clinical quality measure numerator criteria had a positive predictive value of 88.7% (95% confidence intervals, 80.6–94.2%) and negative predictive value of 99.7% (95% confidence intervals, 98.2–100%). False-positive results frequently involved easily correctible respiratory therapist documentation errors. Risk-adjusted rates of postoperative respiratory failure across hospitals ranged from 0.0 to 16.8/1,000 hospitalizations. The risk model, which included 8 comorbidities, 6 laboratory tests, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, had a c-statistic of 0.91. Conclusion: Postoperative respiratory failure can be measured with high validity from readily available, structured electronic health record data. A postoperative respiratory failure electronic clinical quality measure would not be dependent on administrative claims data or collection by trained abstractors, offering the potential to inform quality improvement in elective perioperative care. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007165402,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: Patients who underwent curative-intent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma between 2000 and 2023 were identified using a multi-institutional international database. Preoperative characteristics were assessed in relation to severe complications (defined as complications with a Clavien-Dindo classification III or greater) and very early recurrence (recurrence within 6 months after surgery) using multivariable analysis. Predictive models for severe complications and very early recurrence were developed and externally validated. Results: Among 969 patients, 97 patients (10.0%) experienced severe complications, and 116 patients (12.0%) developed very early recurrence. On multivariable analysis, American Society of Anesthesiologists class >2 and greater albumin-bilirubin score were associated with severe complications. Meanwhile, a greater albumin-bilirubin score and higher tumor burden score were associated with very early recurrence. A predictive model for very early recurrence was able to stratify patients relative to their risk for recurrence: low-risk (6-month recurrence-free survival, 94.1%), medium-risk (6-month recurrence-free survival, 86.0%), and high-risk (6-month recurrence-free survival, 67.1%). A total of 74 patients (7.6%) had an unfavorable risk profile (severe complication risk ≥30% and high-risk for very early recurrence).

The use of novel agents, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), has increased in the general population due to beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and weight loss. However, there is limited data in the SOT population. A retrospective, observational, matched cohort study in outpatient SOT recipients on injectable diabetes therapy was performed at a single academic medical center. The purpose of the study was to compare glycemic control in SOT recipients using a GLP-1-RA-containing regimen compared with insulin-only when initiated within 12 months of transplant. Seventy patients were included in the analysis with 51% of subjects in each group reaching their A1c goal within 1 year after starting diabetes therapy. The median A1c was 7.0% in the GLP-1 RA group and 6.9% in the insulin only group (P = .30). One year after starting diabetes therapy, insulin use decreased to 69% in the GLP-1 RA group, while 94% of subjects in the insulin only group remained on insulin (P = .007). There were 7.2 fewer injections per week in the GLP-1 RA group compared to 4.6 more in the insulin group (P < 0.001). In SOT recipients within 12 months of transplant, the use of GLP-1 RA for blood glucose management had the same A1C goal attainment as insulin-only while allowing for fewer injections per week. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000929643,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Current guidelines endorse completion of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessments (CGAs) in older adults prior to treatment election to objectively measure frailty, however, these are rarely performed in urologic practice due to inadequate resources. We hypothesized CGA implementation would be feasible and identify multifaceted vulnerabilities beyond standard risk assessments in a multidisciplinary BC clinic and developed a novel method to visualize “vulnerability phenotypes” to guide supportive interventions. Methods: Adults with BC were prospectively enrolled (June, 2020–July, 2021). Initially, patients underwent standard of care (SOC) risk assessment (N = 27). Subsequently, patients completed CGAs augmented with body composition assessments (N = 67). CGA completion time, rates, and patient-reported burden were assessed. Interdependence of CGA domains were quantified using Spearman correlation coefficients and compared decisional conflict and regret between arms. Vulnerability phenotypes were visualized using Spider Plots, generated in R. Clinical and survival associations with CGAs were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: 94 patients were enrolled with a median age of 72 years. Instrument completion in the CGA cohort was 79% to 100%. 91% of patients reported CGA completion was at most minimally burdensome. CGAs identified vulnerabilities including 31% vulnerable-to-moderately frail, 21% with mild-to-severe depression, 3% with mild-moderate dementia, and 40% at risk for malnutrition-malnourished. Frailty measures across instruments were weakly correlated (rho <0.4). In this heterogeneous cohort, vulnerability domains were not significantly associated with decisional conflict/regret, survival, nor complication rates after treatment. A novel Spider Plot tool is proposed to facilitate communication of the dominant vulnerability-driving individual risks. Conclusions: CGAs can be successfully incorporated into uro-oncology practice with low perceived burden, identifying key vulnerabilities with implications for clinical care. Weak correlations across instruments support the value of gathering information across discrete domains. We present a novel approach to visually characterize personalized vulnerability phenotypes. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004283444,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The overproduction of a heterologous protein can impose various bottlenecks on these networks. Identifying and alleviating these bottlenecks can guide strain engineering efforts to enhance protein production. The methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii is used for its high capacity to produce recombinant proteins. Here, we use ribosome profiling to identify bottlenecks in protein secretion during heterologous expression of human serum albumin (HSA). Validation of this analysis showed that the knockout of non-essential genes whose gene products target the ER, through co- and post-translational mechanisms, and have high ribosome utilization can increase production of a heterologous protein, HSA. A triple knockout in co-translationally translocated carbohydrate and acetate transporter Gal2p, cell wall maintenance protein Ydr134cp, and the post-translationally translocated cell wall protein Aoa65896.1 increased HSA production by 35 %. This data-driven strain engineering approach uses cell-level information to identify gene targets for phenotype improvement. This specific case identifies hits and creates strains with improved HSA production, with Ribo-seq and bioinformatic analysis to identify non-essential ER targeted proteins that are high ribosome utilizers. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004345673,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to evaluate the safety of [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-I&T in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods: VIOLET was an investigator-initiated, single-centre, phase 1/2 trial, conducted at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Eligible patients were men aged 18 years or older with progressive mCRPC (histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate or unequivocal diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer with an elevated serum prostate specific antigen) previously treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and taxane chemotherapy (unless medically unsuitable), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2, and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positivity (maximum standardised uptake value ≥20 on PSMA PET-CT) without discordance on 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET-CT. Dose escalation (3 + 3 design) had three prespecified radioactivities (4·4 GBq, 5·5 GBq, and 7·4 GBq). Up to six cycles of [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-I&T were administered intravenously every 6 weeks, reduced by 0·4 GBq for each cycle. Primary endpoints of phase 1 were dose-limiting toxicities, the maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended phase 2 dose, and the primary objective of phase 2 was evaluation of adverse events as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. We present here an interim analysis, with follow-up ongoing and recruitment reopened for an additional dose level (9·5 GBq). The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05521412). Findings: Between Oct 14, 2022 and Feb 15, 2024, 30 eligible patients were enrolled. Median age was 69·0 years (IQR 66·0–74·8), screening PSA 26·9 ng/mL (10·1–70·0), PSMA mean standardised uptake value 8·2 (7·4–10·8), and 20 (67%) of 30 patients had received previous docetaxel. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. The maximum administered dose and recommended phase 2 dose was 7·4 GBq. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were limited to pain (one [3%] of 30; the only serious TRAE) and lymphopenia (one [3%] of 30). No grade 4 TRAEs or treatment-related deaths occurred. No dose reductions or treatment discontinuation occurred for toxicity. Interpretation: [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-I&T is safe at the maximum administered dose of 7·4 GBq. Further investigation of this promising radionuclide is warranted in larger, randomised clinical trials.

This study aimed to determine the incidence of type 2 diabetes over 33 481 person-years and identify its principal risk factors in middle-aged adults (ie, those aged 40–60 years) from four sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: Longitudinal data were available from 6553 participants aged 40–60 years at baseline from study centres in South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, and Burkina Faso. Sociodemographic, behavioural, clinical, and biochemical data were collected at baseline and after an interval of 5–6 years. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was determined at each timepoint and diabetes incidence was calculated. A two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis was used to identify baseline risk factors for incident diabetes. Findings: The overall incidence of type 2 diabetes was 14·6 (95% CI 13·4–16·0) cases per 1000 person-years. The incidence was highest in South Africa with 21·8 (19·5–24·4) cases per 1000 person-years, and lowest in west Africa with 5·5 (4·4–6·9) cases per 1000 person-years. Baseline glucose (adjusted odds ratio 1·37; 95% CI 1·16–1·42), being male (1·32; 1·12–1·54), family history of type 2 diabetes (1·22; 1·01–1·46), unemployment (1·19; 1·03–1·37), hypertension (1·21; 1·01–1·45), BMI (1·03; 1·02–1·04), and waist circumference (1·02; 1·01–1·03), were associated with a higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes, while adequate baseline physical activity (0·87; 0·76–1·00) was associated with lower risk. Interpretation: The high incidence of type 2 diabetes in this middle-aged sub-Saharan Africa population is influenced by several modifiable risk factors that should inform interventions to mitigate the disease burden.

We updated the systematic review and meta-analysis that informed the 2015 guidelines to inform new cutoffs for non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis for the 2024 WHO guidelines for chronic hepatitis B. Methods: We searched PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, and Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science) for studies published in any language between Jan 1, 2014, and Feb 15, 2023. We included all studies that reported cross-sectional data on the staging of fibrosis or cirrhosis with APRI, Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), and FibroScan compared with liver biopsy as the reference standard in people with chronic hepatitis B. We excluded studies in which the maximum interval between liver biopsy and non-invasive fibrosis test was more than 6 months; that reported on fewer than ten patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis; that were done exclusively in children; and did not report diagnostic accuracy across our prespecified ranges of test cutoffs. The results of this updated search were collated with the meta-analysis that informed the 2015 guidelines. Outcomes of interest were the sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive tests using defined index test cutoffs for detecting significant fibrosis (≥F2), advanced fibrosis (≥F3), and cirrhosis (F4) based on the METAVIR staging system. We performed meta-analyses using a bivariate random-effects model. Findings: Of 19 933 records identified by our search strategy, 195 were eligible for our systematic review and combined with the 69 studies from the previous meta-analysis to total 264. Two studies were at low risk of bias, 31 studies had unclear risk of bias, and 231 studies had a high risk of bias. Of these 264, 211 studies with 61 665 patients were used in the meta-analysis. For the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (≥F2), sensitivity and specificity were 72·9% (95% CI 70·2–75·5) and 64·7% (95% CI 61·0–68·2) for the APRI low cutoff (>0·3 to 0·7), 30·5% (23·7–38·3) and 92·3% (89·3–94·6) for the APRI high cutoff (>1·3 to 1·7), and 75·1% (72·2–77·7) and 79·3% (76·2–82·2) for FibroScan (>6·0 to 8·0 kPa), respectively. For the diagnosis of cirrhosis (F4), sensitivity and specificity were 59·4% (53·2–65·2) and 73·9% (70·1–77·4) for the APRI low cutoff (>0·8 to 1·2), 30·2% (24·2–36·9) and 88·2% (85·4–90·6) for the APRI high cutoff (>1·8 to 2·2), and 82·6% (77·8–86·5) and 89·0% (86·3–91·2) for FibroScan (>11·0 to 14·0 kPa), respectively. Using a hypothetical population of 1000 unselected patients with chronic hepatitis B with a 25% prevalence of significant fibrosis (≥F2), the APRI low cutoff for significant fibrosis (≥F2) would result in 262 (26·2%) false positives but only 68 (6·8%) false negatives. The FibroScan cutoff would result in 158 (15·8%) false positives and 63 (6·3%) false negatives. In a population with a 5% prevalence of cirrhosis (F4), the APRI low cutoff for cirrhosis (F4) would result in 247 (24·7%) false positives and 21 (2·1%) false negatives and the FibroScan cutoff would result in 105 (10·5%) false positives and nine (0·9%) false negatives. Interpretation: These findings have informed new thresholds of APRI and FibroScan for diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in the 2024 WHO guidelines on chronic hepatitis B, with an APRI score greater than 0·5 or a FibroScan value greater than 7·0 kPa considered to identify most adults with significant fibrosis (≥F2) and an APRI score greater than 1·0 or a FibroScan value greater than 12·5 kPa to identify most adults with cirrhosis (F4). These patients are a priority for antiviral treatment. Funding: WHO. © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Singh M.; Phillips K.; Wang J.; Subramanian A.; Eastwood K.-A.; Nirantharakumar K.; Crowe F.L.,"Trends in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases during pregnancy in the UK, 2000–21: a retrospective cohort study",2025,The Lancet Rheumatology,10.1016/S2665-9913(25)00039-6,"Background: Autoimmune diseases are increasingly prevalent worldwide and disproportionately affect women of reproductive age, including during pregnancy. Given the association between autoimmune diseases, comorbidities, and risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, we aimed to estimate the burden of autoimmune disease in pregnancy. Methods: This was a UK population-based retrospective cohort study using routinely collected data from two large databases (Clinical Practice Research Datalink Gold and Aurum) and associated pregnancy registers. Prevalence was calculated annually for 17 autoimmune diseases (Addison's disease, alopecia areata, ankylosing spondylitis, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's disease, SLE, systemic sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and vitiligo) in pregnancies among women of reproductive age (15–49 years) from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2021. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, describing the relationship between women's characteristics (age, ethnicity, deprivation, BMI, smoking status, and gravidity), comorbidities, and autoimmune diseases. Patient and public involvement and engagement representatives participated in formulating the research question. They also played key role in collaboration with clinicians and researchers to identify and consider the list of autoimmune diseases in the study, and played a key role in disseminating the results. Findings: 5 165 960 pregnancies in 2 831 472 women were included. In 2000–21, there were 185 208 pregnancies in 100 655 women who had a coded diagnosis of autoimmune disease. There was an increase in prevalence of the combination of 17 autoimmune diseases, from 6058 (3·5%) of 172 430 in 2000 to 8429 (4·7%) of 181 532 in 2021. Of the 17 autoimmune diseases studied, psoriasis had the highest prevalence throughout the study period. The prevalence of most of the autoimmune diseases increased from 2000 to 2021. The steepest rise was Hashimoto's thyroiditis, followed by coeliac disease, Grave's disease, and type 1 diabetes. Women in less deprived areas had higher odds of an autoimmune disease during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 1·10 [95% CI 1·07–1·14]), whereas minority ethnic groups had lower prevalence rates compared with White women (Black women 0·48 [0·45–0·51]; Asian women 0·81 [0·77–0·85]). Ex-smokers had significantly higher odds of autoimmune disease than non-smokers (1·20 [1·18–1·23]). When compared with women with a single pregnancy, the odds of having an autoimmune disease were significantly higher for women with five or more pregnancies (1·12 [1·10–1·15]). Women with metabolic and mental health conditions had significantly higher odds of having an autoimmune disease during pregnancy (type 2 diabetes, 1·41 [1·30–1·53]; hypertension, 1·07 [1·01–1·13]; anxiety, 1·15 [1·12–1·19]; depression, 1·17 [1·14–1·20]). Interpretation: The growing burden of autoimmune diseases in pregnancy calls for research into their impact on outcomes. Health policy should address gaps in specialised care to ensure individuals receive evidence-based care to prevent deterioration of the autoimmune disease and development of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Here, polymeric arsenical scaffolds with varying As-functionalized acrylamide monomer (AsAm) composition are combined with PtII giving rise to hydrogels (P1-Pt−P4-Pt) with their properties being dependent on the AsAm content. The nature of the Pt−polymer interaction has been thoroughly investigated by 1H and 195Pt NMR spectroscopy as well as FT-IR, SEM, XPS, and potentiometric titration suggesting that cross-linking occurs primarily via coordination between oxygen atoms of the pendant arsenic acid group and PtII, while secondary noncovalent interactions are proposed to provide further structural integrity and stability. Importantly, the hydrogels demonstrate potential self-healing properties, while the nature of the cross-linking promotes deep penetration of water into the loosely cross-linked networks. Finally, preliminary qualitative antimicrobial evaluation conducted via disk diffusion assay indicates that P4-Pt is active against Gram-negative (uropathogenic Escherichia coli CFT073 and Escherichia coli K12MG1655) and Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus USA 300 JE2) bacterial strains. Overall, the combination of polymeric arsenical scaffolds with PtII results in the formation of cross-linked networks generating soft, strong, and self-healing hydrogels with tunable stiffness and elasticity and preliminary indications of antimicrobial potential. © 2025 The Authors.

Although nominal concentrations (Cnom) are typically used in an in vitro bioassay, freely dissolved concentrations (Cfree) are considered a more accurate dose metric because they account for chemical partitioning processes and are informative about MOA. We determined the Cfree of IL cations in AREc32 and AhR-CALUX assays using both mass balance model (MBM) prediction and experimental quantification. Partition coefficients between membrane lipid-water (Kmw), serum albumin-water (Kalbumin/w), and cell-water (Kcell/w) as well as potential confounding factors (binding to a test plate and micelle formation) were determined to improve the MBM prediction. IL cations showed a higher affinity for both cell lines than that predicted by the MBM based on Kmw and Kalbumin/w. Their affinity for the AhR-CALUX cells was more than 1 order of magnitude higher than for the AREc32, signifying cell line-specific affinity. The MBM with an experimental Kcell/w accurately predicted Cfree. Evaluating cytotoxicity based on Cfree eliminated the leveling off of toxicity observed for hydrophobic IL cations (side chain cutoff), suggesting that Cnom underestimates the effects of compounds with high affinity for the assay medium. Cell membrane concentrations calculated from Cfree using Kmw were compared to the critical membrane burden to identify whether IL cations act as baseline toxicants. The IL cations carrying 16 carbons in the chain in the AREc32 assay and most of the IL cations in the AhR-CALUX assay were classified as excess toxicants. However, since the reasons for the deviation of experimental Kcell/w from MBM prediction remain unexplained, it is uncertain whether the cell membrane concentrations can be well predicted from Kmw used in this study. Therefore, future studies should aim to uncover the underlying causes of differing cell affinities observed across cell lines and model predictions. © 2025 The Authors.

Picoplatin emerged as a promising alternative to circumvent GSH-induced tumor resistance by introducing a bulky 2-picoline ligand. Although clinical studies were encouraging, picoplatin did not receive approval. Interestingly, the anticancer potential of prodrugs based on picoplatin is widely underexplored, and even less so the respective tumor-targeting approaches. We synthesized two new “hybrid” picoplatin(II) derivatives with an oxalate or cyclobutane dicarboxylate leaving group and their corresponding platinum(IV) prodrugs with an albumin-targeting maleimide moiety or a succinimide as reference. Picoplatin(II) and its derivatives indeed reacted much slower with GSH compared to the respective analogs cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin. While PicoCarbo(IV) and PicoOxali(IV) were reduced slowly in the presence of ascorbic acid, picoplatin(IV) was extremely unstable. All three prodrugs were widely inactive in the MTT assays. The platinum(IV)-maleimide complexes rapidly bound to albumin with stable conjugates for >25 h. Albumin-binding resulted in elevated platinum plasma levels, prolonged blood circulation, and enhanced tumor accumulation of the prodrugs in mice bearing CT26 tumors. However, only maleimide-functionalized PicoCarbo(IV) and picoplatin(II) significantly inhibited tumor growth. One possible explanation is that for albumin-binding platinum(IV) prodrugs, the bulky 2-picoline moiety prevents sufficient activation/reduction to unlock their full anticancer potential. © 2025 The Authors.

On the other hand, the ruthenium(III) complexes generally show low solubility and stability in an aqueous environment but exhibit some toxicity associated with unspecific delivery. For these reasons, numerous ongoing studies deal with their encapsulation into various delivery systems to maximize their therapeutic efficacy. One of these systems can also be crystals of nontoxic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In this work, we studied incorporation of a bioactive ruthenium(III) complex (RuC) inside MOFs derived from γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) and biocompatible potassium ions, forming CD-MOF-1. Viability studies in vitro were carried out using spheroids of human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2. These studies revealed that the RuC-CD-MOF-1 system provides effective cancer cell suppression through slow gradual release over a longer period (>10 days) while reducing acute cytotoxic effects associated with naked RuC.

The first step involved all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) modeling of physicochemical characteristics yielding PARG molecule conformations, its contour length, and the cross-section area. It was also shown that PARG molecules, even in concentrated electrolyte solutions (100 mM NaCl), assume a largely elongated shape with an aspect ratio of 36. Using the parameters derived from MD, the PARG adsorption kinetics at the silica/electrolyte interface was calculated using the random sequential adsorption approach. These predictions were validated by optical reflectometry measurements. It was confirmed that the molecules irreversibly adsorbed in the side-on orientation and their coverage agreed with the elongated shape of the PARG molecule predicted from the MD modeling. These theoretical and experimental results were used for the interpretation of the quartz crystal microbalance measurements carried out under various pH conditions. A comprehensive analysis unveiled that the results stemming from the hydrodynamic theory postulating a lubrication-like (soft) contact of the macroion molecules with the sensor adequately reflect the adsorption kinetics. The range of validity of the intuitively used Sauerbrey model was also estimated. It was argued that acquired results can be exploited to control macroion adsorption at solid/liquid interfaces. This is essential for the optimum preparation of their supporting layers used for bioparticle immobilization and shell formation at nanocapsules in targeted drug delivery. © 2025 The Authors.

In the vast landscape of innovative materials developed to counteract artwork degradation, gels have emerged as ideal candidates for cleaning delicate and complex surfaces. More specifically, twin-chain networks (TCNs), i.e., sponge-like hydrogels obtained through spontaneous polymer-polymer phase separation and sustainable freeze-thawing, showed unprecedented cleaning performances on modern/contemporary iconic paintings, such as works by Jackson Pollock and Pablo Picasso. The key to their efficacy lies in the complex cleaning mechanism at the gel-substrate interface. Recent findings suggest that the pore size and connectivity, affecting the nanoscale tortuosity, play a crucial role in determining the gels’ uptake (cleaning) ability. Nonetheless, diffusion of soil through the gel networks is only part of the complex processes that control the removal of unwanted layers from painted surfaces. A deeper understanding of the cleaning mechanism requires studying the uptake of solid particulate matter: gel adhesion and surface roughness affect the cleaning performance of a gel. In this work, TCNs with modulated porosity, obtained by mixing poly(vinyl alcohol)s (PVAs) of different hydrolysis degrees and molecular weights, were characterized through different techniques (confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and rheology) to relate porosity and structural features to the surface roughness and diffusional properties of the gels.

Inhibition of MAGL offers unique advantages over the direct activation of cannabinoid receptors in treating cancer, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory diseases. Although specific fluorescent molecular imaging probes are commonly used for the real-time analysis of the localization and distribution of drug targets in cells, they are almost invariably composed of a linker connecting the pharmacophore with a large fluorophore. In this study, we have developed miniaturized fluorescent probes targeting MAGL by incorporating a highly fluorescent boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moiety into the inhibitor structure that interacts with the MAGL active site. These miniaturized fluorescent probes exhibit favorable drug-like properties such as high solubility and permeability, picomolar potency for MAGL across various species, and high cell selectivity and specificity. A range of translational investigations were conducted, including cell-free fluorescence polarization assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and confocal fluorescence microscopy of live cancer cells, live primary neurons, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids. Furthermore, the application of red-shifted analogs or 18F positron emission labeling illustrated the significant versatility and adaptability of the fluorescent ligands in various experimental contexts. © 2025 The Authors.

We examined how body composition, measured from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and common measures of adiposity (e.g., body mass index (BMI)), are related to hormone concentrations in men from the UK Biobank study. Methods: Up to 16,237 men with available body composition data (including visceral, subcutaneous, and liver fat, muscle fat infiltration (MFI), lean tissue, and common adiposity measures) and serum hormone measurements (insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and calculated free testosterone) were included. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were used to determine the geometric mean hormone and SHBG concentrations across categories of each exposure. Results: Common measurements of adiposity were highly correlated with MRI measures of central and total adiposity (r = 0.76–0.91), although correlations with ectopic fat (liver fat and MFI) were lower (r = 0.43–0.54). Most adiposity measurements showed an inverse U- or J-shaped association with circulating IGF-I and free testosterone; however, MFI was linearly inversely associated, and lean tissue volume was positively associated with both IGF-I and free testosterone concentrations. All body composition measures were inversely associated with total testosterone and SHBG concentrations (relative geometric mean difference between Q5 vs. Q1: 20–30%). Conclusion: Our results show that common adiposity and most MRI measures of adiposity relate similarly to serum hormone concentrations; however, associations with ectopic fat (particularly MFI) and lean tissue were different. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207024096,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: In a retrospective cohort study using UK Biobank data, participants recalled childhood maltreatment. Linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the associations with body mass index (BMI), obesity, and T2D, adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Decomposition analysis was used to examine the extent to which T2D excess risk was attributed to BMI. Results: Of the 153,601 participants who completed the childhood maltreatment questions, one-third reported some form of maltreatment. Prevalence of adult obesity and incidence of T2D were higher with the number of reported childhood maltreatment types. People who reported ≥3 types of childhood maltreatment were at higher risk of obesity (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.47–1.63) and incident T2D (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.52–1.80). Excess T2D risk among those reporting maltreatment could be reduced by 39% if their BMI was comparable to participants who had not been maltreated, assuming causality. Conclusions: People who recalled maltreatment in childhood are at higher risk of T2D in adulthood, partly due to obesity. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207309960,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: Clinical measures included serum glucose, insulin, adipokines, blood pressure and anthropometric measures. MS was determined using the Harmonized criteria. The final sample included 2087 adults. Results: After adjusting for age, sex, and fat mass, L/A ratio, unlike HOMA-IR, was significantly associated with MS across all sites (p < 0.001). Within sites, L/A ratio was only associated with MS and HOMA-IR in the US (p < 0.001) and South Africa (p < 0.01), respectively. Leptin was associated with MS in South Africa only (p < 0.05) but was significantly associated with HOMA-IR across all five sites and within the US (p < 0.05). Similarly, adiponectin was associated with HOMA-IR in South Africa (p < 0.05) and with MS across all five sites (p < 0.001) and within each site separately, except Ghana. Conclusions: Our study suggests that individuals of the African diaspora in different geographical locations may differ in the determinants of MS. Future studies should investigate the determinants for the disparate relationships between MS, IS and adipokines across different African-origin populations. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207244017,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

So far, it remains unknown whether expression of these antigens on MC is of prognostic significance in SM. We performed a retrospective multi-center study of patients with SM using the data set of the registry of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis, including 5034 patients with various MC disorders. The percentage of CD2-, CD25+ and/or CD30+ MC was considerably lower in patients with indolent SM compared to patients with advanced SM, including aggressive SM and MC leukemia. Whereas CD25 and CD30 expression in MC could not be associated with prognosis, we found that lack of CD2 expression in MC is associated with a significantly reduced overall survival (OS) in patients with SM (p < 0.0001). Lack of CD2 was also associated with the presence of extramedullary involvement affecting the spleen, liver, and/or lymph nodes (odds ratio 2.63 compared to SM with CD2+ MC). Together, lack of CD2 expression in MC is a prognostic marker and indicator of reduced OS and extramedullary disease expansion in patients with SM.

There are well-established biomarkers for CKD diagnosis. However, the existing routine standard tests are lab-based and governed by strict regulations. Creatinine is commonly measured as a filtration biomarker in blood to determine estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), as well as a normalization factor to calculate urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (uACR) for CKD evaluation. In this study, we developed a passive flow microreactor for colorimetric urine creatinine measurement (uCR-Chip), which is highly amenable to integration with our previously developed microfluidic urine albumin assay. The combination of the 2-phase pressure compensation (2-PPC) technique and microfluidic channel network design accurately controls the fluidic mixing ratio and chemical reaction. Together with an optimized observation window (OW) design, a uniform and stable detection signal was achieved within 7 min. The color signal was measured by a simple USB microscope-based platform to quantify creatinine concentration in the sample. The combination of the custom in-house photomask production techniques and dry-film photoresist-based lithography enabled rapid iterative design optimization and precise chip fabrication. The developed assay achieved a dynamic linear detection range up to 40 mM and a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 0.521 mM, meeting the clinical precision requirements (comparable to existing point-of-care (PoC) systems). The microreactor was validated using creatinine standards spiked into commercial artificial urine that mimics physiological matrix. Our results showed acceptable recovery rate and low matrix effect, especially for the low creatinine concentration range in comparison to a commercial PoC uACR test. Altogether, the developed uCR-Chip offers a viable PoC test for CKD assessment and provides a potential platform technology to measure various disease biomarkers.

This study reports T1D burden among adolescents and young adults aged 10–24-year-old age group at global, regional, and national levels. Methods: Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, we described the burden of T1D in the 10–24-year-old age group. We further analyzed these trends by age, sex, and the Social Development Index. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to assess temporal trends. Results: T1D incidence among adolescents and young adults increased from 7·78 per 100,000 population (95% UI, 5·27–10·60) in 1990 to 11·07 per 100,000 population (95% UI, 7·42–15·34) in 2019. T1D mortality increased from 5701·19 (95% UI, 4642·70–6444·08) in 1990 to 6,123·04 (95% UI, 5321·82–6887·08) in 2019, representing a 7·40% increase in mortality. The European region had the highest T1D incidence in 2019. Middle-SDI countries exhibited the largest increase in T1D incidence between 1990 and 2019. Conclusion: T1D is a growing health concern globally, and T1D burden more heavily affects countries with low SDI. Specific measures and effective collaboration among countries with different SDIs are required to improve diabetes care in adolescents. Impact: We assessed trends in T1D incidence and burden among youth in the 10–24-year-old age group by evaluating data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Our results demonstrated that global T1D incidence in this age group increased over the past 30 years, with the European region having the highest T1D incidence.

Systematic review has shown increased milk quantity with relaxation interventions. We hypothesised that a self-directed audio relaxation and lactation-specific visualisation would increase milk quantity after a very premature birth. Methods: Unmasked, randomised, controlled trial, recruiting 132 participants in four United Kingdom neonatal units. Eligible women had given birth to one or two infants between 23+0 and 31+6 weeks of gestation. The intervention was a 12-min voice recording including breathing exercises, muscle relaxation and lactation-specific visualisation. Primary outcome was the highest 24-h breastmilk weight expressed on any of day 4, day 14 or day 21 after birth. Results: Mean birth gestation was 27.8 weeks (SD 2.4), with 26% of participants giving birth under 26 weeks (34/132). Adjusted mean difference in primary outcome was 73.9 g (95% CI −61.7 to 209.5, p = 0.28). Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index adjusted mean difference was −1.9 (−8.2 to 4.3, p = 0.54). The majority of relaxation group participants felt the intervention was relaxing (32/42, 76%). Conclusions: There was no beneficial effect of this relaxation intervention on milk quantity. Mothers of very premature infants may value relaxation interventions but they are unlikely to have a large effect on milk quantity. Impact: This randomised trial did not show a beneficial effect of a self-directed audio relaxation and visualisation on mothers’ own milk quantity expressed after very preterm birth. Mothers of very and extremely preterm infants may value relaxation interventions, but they are unlikely to have a large effect on milk quantity. Prior systematic review of mixed populations has shown an increase in mothers’ own milk quantity with relaxation interventions. Combining this study with existing meta-analysis could result in a new hypothesis that the lower the gestation at birth, the smaller the impact of relaxation on milk quantity. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205078985,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, the causality of these associations and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. We utilized a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal effects of blood OCN levels on AD and to assess the potential involvement of glucose and lipid metabolism. Independent instrumental variables strongly associated (P < 5E-08) with blood OCN levels were obtained from three independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the human blood proteome (N = 3301 to 35,892). Two distinct summary statistics datasets on AD from the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP, N = 63,926) and a recent study including familial-proxy AD patients (FPAD, N = 472,868) were used. Summary-level data for fasting glucose (FG), 2h-glucose post-challenge, fasting insulin, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides were incorporated to evaluate the potential role of glucose and lipid metabolism in mediating the impact of OCN on AD risk. Our findings consistently demonstrate a significantly negative correlation between genetically determined blood OCN levels and the risk of AD (IGAP: odds ratio [OR, 95%CI] = 0.83[0.72–0.96], P = 0.013; FPAD: OR = 0.81 [0.70–0.93], P = 0.002). Similar estimates with the same trend direction were obtained using other statistical approaches. Furthermore, employing multivariable MR analysis, we found that the causal relationship between OCN levels and AD was disappeared after adjustment of FG and TC (IGAP: OR = 0.97[0.80–1.17], P = 0.753; FPAD: OR = 0.98 [0.84–1.15], P = 0.831). There were no apparent instances of horizontal pleiotropy, and leave-one-out analysis showed good stability of the estimates. Our study provides evidence supporting a protective effect of blood OCN levels on AD, which is primarily mediated through regulating FG and TC levels. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying physio-pathological mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193738047,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We postulated that metabolically active tumors may compete with the brain for glucose uptake and evaluated glucose uptake in the brain and liver in patients with multiple myeloma in various states of response and relapse. The ratio of brain to liver glucose activity (B2LR) mirrors disease activity in myeloma, predicts the presence of extramedullary disease and is also predictive of a short response to chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. Patients with a low B2LR also have an inferior survival compared to patients with persistently higher B2LR values.

Notably, MASLD prevalence is lower in premenopausal women than in men, suggesting a potential protective role of estrogens in mitigating disease onset and progression. In this study, we utilized preclinical in vitro models—immortalized cell lines and hepatocyte-like cells derived from human embryonic stem cells—exposed to clinically relevant steatotic-inducing agents. These exposures led to lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and mitochondrial dysfunction, along with decreased expression of markers associated with hepatocyte functionality and differentiation. Estrogen treatment in steatotic-induced liver cells resulted in reduced ROS levels and LD content while preserving mitochondrial integrity, mediated by the upregulation of mitochondrial thioredoxin 2 (TRX2), an antioxidant system regulated by the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, disruption of TRX2, either pharmacologically using auranofin or through genetic interference, was sufficient to counteract the protective effects of estrogens, highlighting a potential mechanism through which estrogens may prevent or slow MASLD progression. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731665,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, developing hydrogel nanofiber-based nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) with tailored drug release profiles to synergistically promote angiogenesis and axonal regeneration remains a significant challenge. In this study, novel polydopamine (PDA)-modified gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel nanofibers are developed as an efficient drug delivery platform for sustained release of Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein-2 (SFRP2). This platform aims to promote neurite outgrowth, facilitate nerve function recovery, and enhance angiogenesis through Wnt signaling pathways. Results indicate that PDA coating significantly improves the hydrophilicity and mechanical properties of GelMA hydrogel nanofibers, which were fabricated using a combination of electrospinning and photo-crosslinking technology. This modification enables SFRP2 loading for sustained release through π-π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding. In vitro experiments demonstrate that SFRP2-loaded hydrogel nanofibers effectively enhance the adhesion, proliferation, viability, and migration of Mouse Schwann Cells (MSCs), while also promoting tube formation and ameliorating the inflammatory microenvironment of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, the SFRP2-loaded hydrogel nanofibers are confirmed to exert their functions for angiogenesis and peripheral nerve regeneration via the calcium-dependent calcineurin/NFATc3 signaling pathway. Finally, the hydrogel nanofiber-based NGCs are applied in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury, and results demonstrate that the SFRP2 ~ PDA@GelMA conduit significantly enhances angiogenesis, promotes peripheral nerve repair, and facilitates target muscle restoration and functional recovery, thus presents a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with peripheral nerve injuries. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009980307,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Method: Objective nutritional screening tools including geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, were evaluated in patients with GC at our institution. Malnutrition was diagnosed according to the GLIM criteria. The diagnostic value of GNRI, PNI, and COUNT scores in identifying GLIM-defined malnutrition was assessed by conducting Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. The Kappa coefficient (k) was used to assess agreement between three objective nutritional screening tools and GLIM criteria. Results: A total of 316 patients were enrolled in this study, and malnutrition was diagnosed in 151 (47.8%) patients based on the GLIM criteria. The GNRI demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.805, 95% CI: 0.758–0.852) for detecting GLIM-defined malnutrition, while the PNI and COUNT score showed poor diagnostic accuracy with AUCs of 0.699 (95% CI: 0.641–0.757) and 0.665 (95% CI: 0.605–0.725) respectively. Among these objective nutritional screening tools, the GNRI-based malnutrition risk assessment demonstrated the highest specificity (80.0%), accuracy (72.8%), PPV (74.8%), NPV (71.4%), and consistency (k = 0.452) with GLIM-defined malnutrition. Conclusions: Compared to PNI and COUNT scores, GNRI demonstrated superior performance as an objective nutritional screening tool for identifying GLIM-defined malnutrition in GC patients. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205223146,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed at investigating to which extent women with GDM adhered to dietary recommendations and to which extent an impact was observed on the glycaemic control compared to women without GDM. Subjects/methods: Women with overweight/obesity (n = 349) were recruited in early pregnancy. GDM was diagnosed with a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test in mid-or-early pregnancy (median 25.9 and 14.7 gestational weeks). Dietary assessments included an index of dietary quality (good ≥ 10 and poor < 10/15 scores) and 3-day food-diaries with nutrient intake calculated and dietary patterns identified. Glucose and insulin concentrations were analysed from blood samples collected in late pregnancy (after GDM diagnosis). Results: Women with GDM (n = 98) followed more often a healthier dietary pattern (62.2%) than women without GDM (49.0%, p < 0.05), but no difference in good dietary quality was seen (53% vs. 59.8%, p = 0.071). While the majority of women with GDM adhered to some recommendations, 51% to carbohydrate, 54.1% to total fat and 69.4% to sucrose, only 16.3% adhered to the protein and 4.1% to the fibre intake recommendations. Women with GDM had lower adherence to protein, total fat and fibre recommendations but higher adherence to that of sucrose than women without GDM (p < 0.05). A good dietary quality was associated with lower insulin and HOMA2-IR values (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Adherence to dietary recommendations, particularly fibre and protein intake, is unsatisfactory in women with GDM. Overall dietary quality is related to better control of glucose metabolism proposing a target for dietary counselling. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000291556,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

It is also critical for type 1 diabetes (T1D) autoimmunity, which has a peak incidence between 1 and 2 years of age. Here, we investigated age-related longitudinal gene expression changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children aged 3 months to 3 years who had an increased genetic risk for T1D, aiming to delineate gene expression trajectories and identify patterns potentially linked to the development of islet autoimmunity. We found 2 432 genes (12.5% of analyzed genes) to exhibit significant temporal dynamics in the first 3 years of life. These genes were grouped into six major clusters each demonstrating distinct expression trajectories of consistent increase or decrease with age, as well as U-shaped, and inverted U-shaped age-related patterns. Notably, genes in clusters with U-shaped expression trajectories, which mirrored the incidence of islet autoantibodies, were enriched for T1D susceptibility genes, particularly within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region. This study underscores the dynamic nature of gene expression in early childhood and its potential connection to T1D risk. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000475955,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The interaction between NP surfaces and plasma-resident biomolecules results in the formation of a biomolecular corona, which varies patient-to-patient and as a function of disease state. This study investigates how the progression of acute systemic inflammatory disease influences NP corona compositions and the corresponding effects on innate immune cell interactions, phenotypes, and cytokine responses. NP coronas alter cell associations in a disease-dependent manner, induce differential co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecule expression, and influence cytokine release. Integrated multi-omics analysis of proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and cytokine datasets highlight a set of differentially enriched TLR4 ligands that correlate with dynamic NP corona-mediated immune activation. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout studies validate that NP coronas mediate this response through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling. Our findings illuminate the personalized nature of corona formation under a dynamic inflammatory condition and its impact on NP-mediated immune activation profiles and inflammation, suggesting that disease progression-related alterations in plasma composition can manifest in the corona to cause unintended toxicity and altered therapeutic efficacy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216608290,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

It remains elusive how macrophages detach these surface-bound particles during phagocytosis. We show that, rather than binding directly to these particles, macrophages form unique β2 integrin-mediated adhesion structures at the cell-substrate interfaces, specifically encircling the surface-bound particles. These circular adhesion structures that we named phagocytic adhesion rings (PARs) serve as strongholds to support local ring-shaped actin structures constricting into the particle-substrate cleavages, thereby pinching off the particles from the substrate. During this process, integrins in PARs sustain tensions due to the reaction force of actin polymerization against the particles. Such tensions are critical for phagocytic efficiency of surface-bound particles. PARs were formed in all tested macrophages (mouse, human and fish) and micron-sized particles (microbeads and E. coli), demonstrating their conserved role in the phagocytosis. This study reveals a mechanism of PAR-mediated phagocytosis, specialized for the detachment and internalization of surface-bound particles. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216999525,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We also observe an age-related decrease in hepatic glutathione (GSH) activity through noninvasive photoacoustic imaging. Using these probes, we perform longitudinal studies in aged mice treated with ATN-224, a Cu chelator, and demonstrate that this treatment improves Cu homeostasis and preserves ALDH1A1 activity.

Clusters fall into two types: “non-diabetogenic hyperinsulinemia,” where clusters are not associated with increased T2D risk, and “diabetogenic hyperinsulinemia,” where T2D associations are driven by body fat distribution, liver function, circulating lipids, or inflammation. In over 1.1 million multi-ancestry individuals, we demonstrated that diabetogenic hyperinsulinemia cluster-specific polygenic scores exhibit varying risks for cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke.

Previous unbiased proteomic studies indicate a potential association between cardiac diseases and the progesterone receptor membrane-bound component-2 (PGRMC2); however, the role of PGRMC2 in the heart remains unknown. In this study, we use a heart-specific knockout (KO) mouse model (MyH6•Pgrmc2flox/flox) in which the Pgrmc2 gene was selectively deleted in cardiomyocytes. Here we show that PGRMC2 serves as a mediator of steroid hormones for rapid calcium signaling in cardiomyocytes to maintain cardiac contraction, sufficient stroke volume, and adequate cardiac output by regulating the cardiac pressure-volume relationship. The KO hearts from male and female mice exhibit an impairment in pressure-volume relationship. Under hypoxic conditions, this pressure-volume dysregulation progresses to congestive left and right ventricular failure in the KO hearts. Overall, we propose that PGRMC2 is a cardiac pressure-volume regulator to maintain normal cardiac physiology, especially during hypoxic stress. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000057298,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The centres can be reversibly oxidized by O2 and H2O2, resulting in a di-Fe3+ form that is non-labile. In the reduced state, a proportion of the iron becomes labile, based on accessibility to Fe2+ chelators and reconstitution experiments, consistent with dynamic iron binding.

This is noteworthy because MMP2 is the most abundant MMP in blood, and MMPs promote atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Artificial intelligence (AlphaFold)-based modeling suggested that APOA1 and MMP2 interact; direct interactions were confirmed using five orthogonal interaction assays, showing that APOA1 binds to MMP2 catalytic and hemopexin-like domains. APOA1 inhibited MMP2 autolysis and allosterically increased MMP2 activity—an effect specifically reproduced by plasma from humans and APOA1-expressing mice but not albumin nor plasma from APOA1 knockout mice.

Though it is well acknowledged that microgravity provides necessary mechanical force signals for cell fate2, how microgravity affects growth, differentiation, and communication is still largely unknown due to the lack of real experimental scenarios and reproducibility tools. Here, Rotating Flat Chamber (RFC) was used to simulate ground-based microgravity effects to study how microgravity effects affect the differentiation of HepaRG (hepatic progenitor cells) cells. Unexpectedly, the results show that RFC conditions could promote HepaRG cell differentiation which exhibited increased expression of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin (ALB), and Recombinant Cytokeratin 18 (CK18). Through screening a series of mechanical receptors, the ion channel TRPML1 was critical for promoting the differentiation effect under RFC conditions. Once TRPML1 was activated by stimulated microgravity effects, the concentration of lysosomal calcium ions was increased to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which finally led to enhanced cell differentiation of HepaRG cells. In addition, the cytoskeleton was remodeled under RFC conditions to influence the expression of PI (3,5) P2, which is the best-known activator of TRPML1. In summary, our findings have established a mechanism by which simulated microgravity promotes the differentiation of HepaRG cells through the TRPML1 signaling pathway, which provides a potential target for the regulation of hepatic stem/progenitor cell differentiation and embryonic liver development under real microgravity conditions.

We revealed a wide dysregulation of lysosome, autophagy, and mitochondrial pathways in these patients, supporting a role of this channel in regulating these cellular processes. The most significant altered lipid classes were Fatty acyls, Glycerophospholipids and Phosphosphingolipids. The plasma level of Phosphatidylcholines (PC) and Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 34:1 significantly correlated with an earlier age at onset of the disease in TMEM175 patients (p = 0.008; p = 0.006). In plasma we also observed altered amino acids metabolic pathways in PD patients. We highlighted that increased level of L-glutamate strongly correlated (p < 0.001) with the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD_TMEM175 patients. In dermal fibroblasts, we disclosed alterations of proteins involved in lipids biosynthesis (PAG15, PP4P1, GALC, FYV1, PIGO, PGPS1, PLPP1), in the insulin pathway (IGF2R), in mitochondrial metabolism (ACD10, ACD11, ACADS) and autophagy (RAB7L). Interestingly, we quantified 43 lysosomal or lysosomal-related proteins, which were differentially modulated between TMEM175 patients and controls. Integrative correlation analysis of proteome and lipidome of PD_TMEM175 cellular models identified a strong positive correlation of 13 proteins involved in biosynthetic processes with PC and Ceramides. Altogether, these data provide novel insights into the molecular and metabolic alterations underlying TMEM175 mutations and may be relevant for PD prediction, diagnosis and treatment. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218153659,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Given that age, inflammation, and blood MPO play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson´s disease (PD), we hypothesized that serum MPO could be associated with PD status. This case-control study (199 participants) was conducted using an extensive protocol, and the concentration and activity of MPO in blood serum were measured. The findings reveal that serum MPO concentration and activity are significantly increased in the patients, and that rates of PD in all individuals are associated with increasing tertiles of MPO concentration and activity. In multivariate logistic regression model adjusting for confounding factors, MPO activity (not concentration) is the factor that is most associated with PD status (OR, 6.921, P = 0.001). Mental depression is directly associated with MPO activity and with PD status (OR, 0.121, B = −2.108, P = 0.002). The use of statins or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs significantly reduces serum MPO activity, but the possible association with the odds of having PD does not survive correction for multiple testing. In summary, both serum MPO concentration and activity are increased in patients with PD, but only MPO enzyme activity is associated with PD status. These findings may have implications for the evaluation of PD. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003652582,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We conducted a retrospective study of 890 PD patients diagnosed during 2000-2020 and 8,100 matched controls, analyzing electronic health records up to 15 years before PD diagnosis. Prevalence was assessed annually to track changes in association strength over time. PD patients consistently showed lower MetS prevalence (OR = 0.57–0.8). Compared to controls, PD patients had lower triglycerides (OR = 0.44–0.75), BMI (OR = 0.54–0.65), and hyperglycemia (OR = 0.81–0.86) rates, and females showed higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (OR = 1.48–1.82), lower low-density lipoprotein/HDL ratio (OR = 0.46–0.64), and reduced hypertension (OR = 0.79–0.85). These findings suggest an inverse association between MetS and PD years before diagnosis. We propose a lipid–blood pressure index incorporating triglycerides, HDL, and hypertension as a potential clinical tool for PD risk stratification. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007250343,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We applied an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to predict long-term all-cause mortality in patients with PD using administrative healthcare data collected at PD diagnosis. Among seven machine learning algorithms, XGBoost achieved the best performance (10-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.836; 5-year AUROC: 0.894). The most important contributing feature to PD mortality was age, followed by male sex and pneumonia. Using XAI models, the nonlinear association between contributing factors and PD mortality was assessed, and an optimal target value to reduce mortality was found. In addition, prediction of individualized 10-year mortality risk for each PD participant was possible. Our XAI modeling pipeline demonstrated the feasibility to predict long-term mortality in patients with PD using preexisting healthcare data. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007075513,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

It has not only resulted in serious consumer misunderstanding but also affect the industry as well. A simple solution possibly lies in nowhere but its soup which uses Maillard reaction products as flavoring agents. Arginine-Glucose Maillard reaction products (Arg-Glc MRPs) have been demonstrated to be antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, which can be useful to remove food caused discomfort. Here we show that Arg-Glc MRPs neither produced significant cytotoxicity nor caused oxidative stress in RAW264.7 macrophages. In theF APPH-induced oxidative damage model, they remarkably reduced cytoplasmic ROS and O2⋅−, and restored the polarization of cytoplasmic membrane potential and mitochondrial membrane potential while enhancing the phagocytic function of normal cells and oxidatively damaged cells.

Despite multiple studies reporting this connection, the mechanism by which T2D exacerbates AD is poorly understood. It is challenging to design studies that address co-occurring and comorbid diseases, limiting the number of existing evidence bases. To address this challenge, we expanded the applications of a computational framework called Translatable Components Regression (TransComp-R), initially designed for cross-species translation modeling, to perform cross-disease modeling to identify biological programs of T2D that may exacerbate AD pathology. Using TransComp-R, we combined peripheral blood-derived T2D and AD human transcriptomic data to identify T2D principal components predictive of AD status. Our model revealed genes enriched for biological pathways associated with inflammation, metabolism, and signaling pathways from T2D principal components predictive of AD. The same T2D PC predictive of AD outcomes unveiled sex-based differences across the AD datasets. We performed a gene expression correlational analysis to identify therapeutic hypotheses tailored to the T2D-AD axis. We identified six T2D and two dementia medications that induced gene expression profiles associated with a non-T2D or non-AD state. We next assessed our blood-based T2DxAD biomarker signature in post-mortem human AD and control brain gene expression data from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. Using partial least squares discriminant analysis, we identified a subset of genes from our cross-disease blood-based biomarker panel that significantly separated AD and control brain samples. Finally, we validated our findings using single cell RNA-sequencing blood data of AD and healthy individuals and found erythroid cells contained the most gene expression signatures to the T2D PC. Our methodological advance in cross-disease modeling identified biological programs in T2D that may predict the future onset of AD in this population. This, paired with our therapeutic gene expression correlational analysis, also revealed alogliptin, a T2D medication that may help prevent the onset of AD in T2D patients. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006893052,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We identified a cyclic deca-peptide incorporating lipoamino acids for delivering T helper and B cell epitopes against group A Streptococcus (GAS), eliciting robust humoral immune responses. In this study, we assessed the function-immunogenicity relationship of the multi-component vaccine candidate (referred to as VC-13) to elucidate a mechanism of action. We identified a potential universal delivery platform, not only capable of adjuvanting different peptide epitopes (e.g., NS1 and 88/30 from group A Streptococcus, gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone [GnRH]), but also protein antigens (e.g., bovine serum albumin [BSA], receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 protein responsible for COVID-19 infection [SARS-CoV-2 RBD]) and small molecular haptens (e.g., cocaine). All vaccine candidates self-assembled into sub-500 nm nanoparticles and induced high antigen-specific systemic IgG titers and opsonic potential compared to the antigen co-administered with a commercial adjuvant, complete Freund’s adjuvant. Notably, presence of the cyclic decapeptide in this vaccine increased accumulation in the draining inguinal lymph nodes, facilitating cellular uptake of peptide antigens. Furthermore, the lipoamino acid promoted dendritic cell activation, acting as both toll-like receptors 2 and 4 -targeting moiety. Our study revealed the importance of the cyclic decapeptide and lipoamino acid presence in antigen presentation and immune response activation, leading onto the development of a fully synthetic, self-assembled, and promising platform for the delivery of subunit vaccines and anti-drug vaccines. © Crown 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218178995,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In our technique, called stacking-induced charge transfer-enhanced Raman scattering (SICTERS), the self-stacked small molecules form an ordered spatial arrangement that enables three-dimensional charge transfer between neighboring molecules. The Raman scattering cross-section of SICTERS nanoprobes is 1350 times higher than that of conventional SERS gold nanoprobes of similar particle size. SICTERS outperforms SERS in terms of in vivo imaging sensitivity, resolution and depth.

Although restrictive eligibility criteria contribute to this issue, the role of selection bias related to prognostic risk remains unclear. In this study, we developed TrialTranslator, a framework designed to systematically evaluate the generalizability of RCTs for oncology therapies. Using a nationwide database of electronic health records from Flatiron Health, this framework emulates RCTs across three prognostic phenotypes identified through machine learning models. We applied this approach to 11 landmark RCTs that investigated anti-cancer regimens considered standard of care for the four most prevalent advanced solid malignancies. Our analyses reveal that patients in low-risk and medium-risk phenotypes exhibit survival times and treatment-associated survival benefits similar to those observed in RCTs. In contrast, high-risk phenotypes show significantly lower survival times and treatment-associated survival benefits compared to RCTs. Our results were corroborated by a comprehensive robustness assessment, including examinations of specific patient subgroups, holdout validation and semi-synthetic data simulation. These findings suggest that the prognostic heterogeneity among real-world oncology patients plays a substantial role in the limited generalizability of RCT results.

As reported separately, tirzepatide decreased cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure. Here, in this mechanistic secondary analysis of the SUMMIT trial, tirzepatide treatment at 52 weeks, as compared with placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure (estimated treatment difference (ETD) −5 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) −7 to −3; P < 0.001), decreased estimated blood volume (ETD −0.58 l, 95% CI −0.63 to −0.52; P < 0.001) and reduced C-reactive protein levels (ETD −37.2%, 95% CI −45.7 to −27.3; P < 0.001). These changes were coupled with an increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (ETD 2.90 ml min−1 1.73 m−2 yr−1, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.86; P = 0.004), a decrease in urine albumin–creatinine ratio (ETD 24 weeks, −25.0%, 95% CI −36 to −13%; P < 0.001; 52 weeks, −15%, 95% CI −28 to 0.1; P = 0.051), a reduction in N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide levels (ETD 52 weeks −10.5%, 95% CI −20.7 to 1.0%; P = 0.07) and a reduction in troponin T levels (ETD 52 weeks −10.4%, 95% CI −16.7 to −3.6; P = 0.003). In post hoc exploratory analyses, decreased estimated blood volume with tirzepatide treatment was significantly correlated with decreased blood pressure, reduced microalbuminuria, improved Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score and increased 6-min walk distance. Moreover, decreased C-reactive protein levels were correlated with reduced troponin T levels and improved 6-min walk distance. In conclusion, tirzepatide reduced circulatory volume–pressure overload and systemic inflammation and mitigated cardiovascular–kidney end-organ injury in patients with HFpEF and obesity, providing new insights into the mechanisms of benefit from tirzepatide.

However, intrinsic factors that counteract vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis remain scarce. Here we identify insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) as a homeostasis-associated molecule that restrains endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis. IGFBP6 levels are significantly reduced in human atherosclerotic arteries and patient serum. Reduction of IGFBP6 in human endothelial cells by siRNA increases inflammatory molecule expression and monocyte adhesion. Conversely, pro-inflammatory effects mediated by disturbed flow (DF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are reversed by IGFBP6 overexpression. Mechanistic investigations further reveal that IGFBP6 executes anti-inflammatory effects directly through the major vault protein (MVP)–c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling axis. Finally, IGFBP6-deficient mice show aggravated diet- and DF-induced atherosclerosis, whereas endothelial-cell-specific IGFBP6-overexpressing mice protect against atherosclerosis. Based on these findings, we propose that reduction of endothelial IGFBP6 is a predisposing factor in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, which can be therapeutically targeted. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217157616,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Separation or a compromise temperature to the detriment of food safety or taste preference are the options. In the present article, we find that it is possible to cook albumen and yolk at two temperatures without separation by using periodic boundary conditions in the energy transport problem. Through mathematical modeling and subsequent simulation, we are able to design the novel cooking method, namely periodic cooking. Comparison with established egg cooking procedures through a plethora of characterization techniques, including Sensory Analysis, Texture Profile Analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy, confirms the different cooking extents and the different variations in protein denaturation with the novel approach. The method not only optimizes egg texture and nutrients, but also holds promise for innovative culinary applications and materials treatment. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218249013,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Atsar F.S.; Bourger H.D.; Baker C.A.,Online integration of capillary electrophoresis and dual detector Taylor dispersion analysis via a 3D printed instrument,2025,Analyst ,10.1039/d4an01208a,"Hydrodynamic radius (RH) is a descriptive metric of protein structure with the potential to impact drug development, disease diagnosis, and other important research areas of molecular biology. Common instrumental methods for molecular size characterization are disadvantageous due to high sample consumption, measurements made in non-physiological conditions, and/or inaccurate size determinations. Capillary Taylor dispersion analysis (TDA) is a molecular sizing method that utilizes nL sample volumes and achieves absolute size determination without calibration or comparison to standards. One key drawback of TDA is that it reports the concentration-weighted average RH, which may be limiting in the analysis of complex sample mixtures. Here, we describe the development of a 3D printed instrument to integrate capillary electrophoresis (CE) separations online with TDA size characterization. Dual laser-induced fluorescence detectors were developed to enable two-channel detection using a single PMT and fluorescence filter set, achieving detection limits for AlexaFluor 532 of 0.6 ± 0.4 nM and 1.1 ± 0.2 nM for detectors 1 and 2, respectively. Joule heating during CE separations was observed to introduce bias in subsequent TDA measurements. The effects of Joule heating were mitigated by integrating a water circulating sheath flow on the portion of the capillary used for CE. The utility of CE-TDA in bioanalysis was demonstrated by standard-free peak identification in the ficin digestion of IgG1. CE-TDA was further applied to characterizing denaturation dynamics of the Group II heat resistant protein apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA), in which RH was observed to increase from 2.3 ± 0.2 nm at 20 °C to 5.2 ± 0.5 nm while heated at at 90 °C, then returned to a quasi-native state with RH = 2.9 ± 0.5 nm after cooling to 20 °C. CE-TDA is a powerful analysis mode with potential to impact various domains of bioanalysis. The instrument developed in this work offers a low barrier to entry for researchers interested in adopting CE-TDA. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215839650,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Cells optimize their function within tissue microenvironments by expressing specific subsets of RNAs. Advances in cell tagging methods enable spatial understanding of RNA expression when merged with transcriptomics. However, these techniques are currently limited by the spatial resolution of the tagging, the number of RNAs that can be sequenced, and multiplexing to isolate spatially-distinct cells within the same tissue landscape. To address these limitations, we developed CrossSeq, which employs photocrosslinking fluorescent probes and confocal microscopy activation to demarcate user-defined regions of interest on fixed cells for multiplexed spatial transcriptomic analysis. We investigate phenyl azide and diazirine crosslinking scaffolds and define their photoactivity profiles. We then deploy the aryl azide scaffold with three fluorophores for multiplexing on glyoxal fixed cells and analyze the defined populations using flow cytometry. Finally, we apply CrossSeq to investigate an in vitro MDA-MB-231-LM2 metastatic cancer migration model to evaluate changes in gene expression at the migratory cell front versus the exterior population. We anticipate this new technology will be a valuable tool addition as it will enable easier access to spatial transcriptomic analysis for the scientific community using conventional microscopy and analysis techniques. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000432302,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Synthesis of 1-3 was accomplished by reacting Hahpa with zinc(II) precursors such as ZnCl2, Zn(NO3)2 6H2O and Zn(ClO4)2 6H2O, respectively, in the presence of NaOH at room temperature. Compounds 1-3 were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, electronic absorption and emission spectroscopy, molar conductivity analysis, and TGA studies. Elemental analysis, molar conductivity analysis, and UV-vis and fluorescence titration results unambiguously confirm the integrity of the compound frameworks. Moreover, the structures of 1-3 were ascertained by density functional theory (DFT) computation using the B3LYP/6-311G level of theory, indicating a distorted square pyramidal geometry around the zinc centers. Furthermore, the anticancer properties of 1-3 were assessed in human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines, revealing a significantly high cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 1.09 to 2.11 mM. They showed high selectivity between the normal and cancer cells despite this potency. The anticancer activity of 1-3 was possibly due to an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), destruction of cell membrane integrity, and DNA damage occurring via nuclear condensation. Electronic absorption spectroscopy, ethidium bromide (EB) displacement assay and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed the binding affinity and binding mode of 1-3 with DNA in a dose-dependent manner. All three compounds were also able to modulate the expression of p53 tumour suppressor protein and exhibited antitumorigenic activity, whereas their activity remained unaltered in the normal cell. When a comparative assessment of anticancer properties of 1-3 was made, 1 showed a higher cytotoxicity towards the cancer cells in comparison to 2 and 3.  © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216734532,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In this work, novel approaches, such as C- and N-terminal modification and cyclization, to improve the proteolytic stability and bioavailability of the CT10 peptide are presented. These efforts resulted in a set of unprecedented potent cyclic inhibitors of HC-mediated ATP release with a half-life largely exceeding 24 hours. Additionally, the introduction of a lipophilic moiety with different solubilizing linkers led to the generation of a novel series of water-soluble and lipidated peptides that exhibited high inhibitory capacity in in vitro assays at submicromolar concentrations.

The nanoparticles were synthesized using mussel-extracted selenium with two reducing agents: d-glucose and orange. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed the presence of selenium. The reducing agent and duration influenced the nanoparticle size. Reduction with d-glucose for 1 hour revealed that the particles exhibited an average size of 10 nm. Copper sulfate-induced malformations such as yolk sac and pericardial edema were observed with 25 μg ml−1 of orange-reduced nanoparticles, while d-glucose-reduced nanoparticles mitigated these malformations at 25 μg ml−1. Treatment with stabilized Se-NPs reduced with d-glucose for 30 minutes showed 33% dose-dependent radical scavenging activities, upregulated approximately 2-fold of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase encoding genes and restored homeostasis by decreasing lipid peroxidation (27.32 nmol mg−1 ml−1) and nitric oxide levels (6.71 μM). They also had the potential to restore cognitive properties such as larval movement (93.40 m) without altering larval behaviour. Live cell imaging indicated a significant decrease in cellular reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation levels in the gut and liver. These findings suggest that Se-NPs reduced for 30 minutes with d-glucose are promising candidates for oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000318593,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

One of the major issues associated with TCS is its limited solubility in aqueous media, which can reduce its effectiveness against bacteria. In this study, we enhanced the aqueous solubility and antibacterial activity of TCS by using a re-dispersible emulsion powder stabilized with gold nanoparticles (GNPs). The developed formulation (TCS/PEG-B/GNPs) demonstrated the ability to dissolve in aqueous media and provided good stability. An antibacterial investigation was conducted using drug-resistant bacterial strains, Escherichia coli (E. coli) BAA-1161 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as model bacteria. The results showed that TCS/PEG-B/GNPs had the highest antibacterial activity. The MRSA strain demonstrated greater susceptibility to TCS (both TCS alone and TCS in the formulation) than E. coli BAA-1161. The cytotoxicity assay was also conducted in THP-1 cells and it was found that the viability of THP-1 cells treated with a 5× dilution of TCS/PEG-B/GNPs was higher than 80%. Altogether, our study proposes a novel approach to overcome the solubility concerns of TCS. These results demonstrated an increase in TCS's solubility and efficacy, which holds great promise for future applications. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215842405,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Chen S.; Triki M.; Pinto Carneiro S.; Merkel O.M.,A novel micelleplex for tumour-targeted delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 against KRAS-mutated lung cancer,2025,Nanoscale,10.1039/d4nr03471f,"CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a highly effective and customizable genome editing tool, holding significant promise for the treatment of KRAS mutations in lung cancer. In this study, we introduce a novel micelleplex, named C14-PEI, designed to co-deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA efficiently to excise the mutated KRAS allele in lung cancer cells. C14-PEI is synthesised from 1,2-epoxytetradecane and branched PEI 600 Da via a ring-opening reaction. The resulting C14-PEI has a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of approximately 20.86 ± 0.15 mg L−1, indicating its ability to form stable micelles at low concentrations. C14-PEI efficiently encapsulates mRNA into micelleplexes through electrostatic interactions. When the mass ratio is 8 (w/w 8), the C14-PEI formulation exhibits conducive properties, which showed encapsulation efficiency of eGFP mRNA at 99% and led to a 130-fold increase in eGFP expression in A549 cells compared to untreated cells, demonstrating the robust delivery and expression capability of the micelleplexes. Importantly, toxicity tests using intracellular reduction of a tetrazolium salt revealed no significant cytotoxicity, underscoring the biocompatibility of C14-PEI. C14-PEI also shows high efficiency in co-encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA, as confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. At an sgRNA to Cas9 mRNA molar ratio of 10, the micelleplexes successfully mediate the cutting of mutated KRAS with an indel efficiency exceeding 60%, as determined by the T7 Endonuclease I (T7EI) assay. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) further demonstrates that the gene editing efficiency, measured by edited gene copies, is 48.5% in the w/w 4 group and 37.8% in the w/w 8 group. Treatment with C14-PEI micelleplexes containing Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA targeting the KRAS G12S mutation significantly impairs the migration capability of A549 cells and increases apoptosis rates. These findings suggest that C14-PEI effectively disrupts KRAS signalling pathways, leading to reduced tumor cell proliferation and enhanced cell death. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000752141,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, its application is limited by severe side effects and drug resistance. The combination of platinum-based chemotherapeutics with EGFR inhibitors has shown remarkable synergism in clinical treatment. To enhance the tolerability of this combination, we designed a novel multi-action oxaliplatin-based platinum(IV) complex with an EGFR-inhibiting moiety (KP2749). KP2749 releases two independent cytotoxic agents upon reduction: oxaliplatin and the EGFR inhibitor KP2187, which was selected for its strong intrinsic fluorescence that became quenched upon complexation to metal ions. In particular, KP2749 demonstrated high stability and specific KP2187 release, with quenched fluorescent properties in its intact form, facilitating the investigation of its intracellular reduction. Notably, by exploiting its fluorescence, we demonstrated that intact KP2749 itself exhibited EGFR-inhibitory properties. Furthermore, subsequent experiments indicated that our complex was able to overcome resistance to oxaliplatin and EGFR inhibitors in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. These effects were not only based on EGFR inhibition and DNA damage, but also improved cellular drug uptake. Finally, in silico docking analysis confirmed that the intact KP2749 complex had EGFR-binding properties, which were different from free KP2187. Consequently, these data suggested that the coordination of EGFR inhibitors to metal cores (like platinum) allow the fine-tuning of their EGFR-targeting properties. In conclusion, this study not only presents a new potential anticancer drug but also offers a novel fluorescent tool to study the intracellular drug release kinetics of platinum(IV) complexes. © the Partner Organisations 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214680452,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Each DES was prepared by combining choline chloride (a hydrogen bond acceptor, HBA) with a different hydrogen bond donor (HBD): oxalic acid (OX), malonic acid (MA), ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol (G), or urea (U). Subsequently, the interactions between fluconazole (FCZ) and these synthesized DESs were investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy at a temperature of 298.15 K. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a strong interaction between fluconazole (FCZ) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs). This was evident from the significant quenching of FCZ's intrinsic fluorescence upon DES addition. The association constant and binding sites were determined. Among the tested DESs, the choline chloride-oxalic acid mixture exhibited the strongest interaction with FCZ. Furthermore, the solubility of FCZ in DES-water mixtures studied at a temperature range of (298.15 to 313.15) K was found to increase with increasing DES concentration. The solubility data were accurately fitted using the e-NRTL and Wilson thermodynamic models. To gain deeper insights, conductor-like screening model (COSMO) calculations were performed on the studied systems.

Herein, we present a two-dimensional orthogonal fluorescence and chemiluminescence design strategy for the probe DCM-SA, which is sequentially activated by albumin-mediated hydrolysis, exhibiting light-up fluorescence and photo-induced cycloaddition generating chemiluminescence, enabling orthogonal signal amplification for discrimination of subtle differences between similar proteins. By orthogonalizing these dual-mode signals, a two-dimensional work curve of fluorescence and chemiluminescence is established to distinguish and quantify similar proteins HSA and BSA. Importantly, the dual-mode signals of DCM-SA exhibit contrary incremental trends towards HSA and BSA. Molecular docking and femtosecond transient absorbance spectroscopy reveal that the lower KD value of DCM-SA with HSA and the longer excited-state lifetime of DCM-SA with BSA underlie the distinct dual-mode responses. Using two-dimensional orthogonal signals, for the first time, we precisely measure the HSA/BSA ratio in mixed serum. This method facilitates rapid blood source identification and trace HSA quantitation in human urine. Our two-dimensional orthogonal amplification approach offers a powerful tool for distinguishing and quantifying subtle differences among highly similar proteins, demonstrating great potential for both basic life science research and clinical applications. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215836223,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli aggregates to dynamic changes in the growth conditions. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystals. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be a common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002681835,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Swelling experiments demonstrated that the incorporation of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) enhanced water retention, while chitosan had a minimal effect on swelling behavior. Qualitative analysis of leachables identified water-soluble components, including dehydrated PVA and PVP. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the formation of ester bonds and indicated increased hydrogen bonding post-crosslinking. Thermal stability was validated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), with decomposition observed at 320–330 1C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed enhanced crystallinity following crosslinking. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) further confirmed chemical changes consistent with the results from other characterization techniques.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) offer multiple important advantages for drug delivery, including stability, protection of active substances, and sustained release capabilities. However, tracking their structural integrity and dynamic behaviour in complex biological environments remains challenging. Here, we report the development of a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-enabled LNP platform that achieves unprecedented sensitivity and precision in monitoring nanoparticle disintegration. The FRET-based LNPs were prepared using nanoprecipitation, encapsulating high levels of 3,30- dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) and 1,10-dioctadecyl- 3,3,30,30-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) fluorophores as the donor and acceptors, respectively. The resulting LNPs had a mean diameter of 114 _ 19 nm with a distinct FRET signal. An optimal energy transfer efficiency of 0.98 and an emission quantum yield of 0.13 were achieved at 11.1% fluorophore loading in the LNPs, balancing efficient energy transfer and minimal aggregation-induced quenching. Using the FRET reporting, three dissociation stages of FRET LNPs were observed: solvation, indicated by an increased emission intensity; swelling and partial dissolution, evidenced by changes in emission maxima and mean size; and complete dissociation, confirmed by emission solely from DiO and the absence of particles. Testing the nanoparticles in live cells (telomerase-immortalised human corneal epithelial cells, hTCEpi cells) revealed a direct link to the disappearance of the FRET signal with the dissociation of FRET NPs. The nanoparticles initially exhibited a strong extracellular FRET signal, which diminished after cellular internalisation. This suggests that the LNPs disintegrate after entering the cells. These findings establish FRET-based LNPs as a robust tool for real-time nanoparticle tracking, offering insights into their integrity and release mechanisms, with potential applications in advanced drug delivery and diagnostics.  © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216700532,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Current research suggests that tendon injuries are affected by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory responses, and type III collagen deposition. These factors lead to an imbalance between extrinsic and intrinsic tendon healing and are the main reasons for the occurrence of peritendinous adhesions. In this study, we constructed a carrier using a polyvinyl alcohol/polyethylene glycol (PVA/PEG) dual network hydrogel and loaded it with zeolite imidazolium ester framework-8@CeO2 nano-enzymes (ZIF-8@CeO2) to form a nano-enzyme-functionalized hydrogel (PVA/PEG/ZIF-8@CeO2) therapeutic system. The surface of PVA/PEG/ZIF-8@CeO2 is rich in hydrophilic hydroxyl groups that form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, creating a hydrated layer that inhibits fibrin adsorption and fibroblast adhesion, reduces the impact of exogenous healing, and reduces the formation of adhesions. Similarly, the loaded ZIF-8@CeO2 has catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, which can effectively remove the excessive ROS in the injured tendon, down-regulate the inflammatory response, enhance the tendon differentiation of tendon stem cells, promote intrinsic healing, and ultimately promote the repair of injured tendons. Furthermore, the system can accelerate the transition from inflammation to repair and remodeling in the tendon healing process. The PVA/PEG/ZIF-8@CeO2 treatment system is a novel approach for reducing peritendinous adhesions and effectively promoting the repair of injured tendons. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009876966,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The interplay between Aβ and Cyt c is thus, crucial in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology, where oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are central features. However, the details of interaction between Cu bound Aβ and Cyt c remain unexplored at a molecular level. Previously it was demonstrated that reduced Cu-Aβ can react with O2 to result in H2O2. This H2O2 produced can oxidize neurotransmitters and this process is catalysed by the oxidized Cu-Aβ. Here spectroscopic analyses reveal that reduced Cu-Aβ transfers electron to oxidized Cyt c, which mitigates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reduced Cu-Aβ species. Thus, Cyt c can exhibit a protective role against ROS generation by Cu-Aβ. On the other hand, the oxidation of reduced Cyt c by H2O2 is significantly accelerated in the presence of Cu-Aβ, highlighting the thus far unknown intrinsic Cyt c peroxidase type activity of oxidized Cu-Aβ. Thus, the generation of oxidized Cyt c, catalyzed by Cu-Aβ, raises the possibility of apoptotic death of brain cells which is a common feature associated with AD, thereby revealing the other face of Janus. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012945252,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

An integrated computational and experimental approach was employed, combining DFT calculations and molecular docking simulations to analyze quercetin's interactions with the MnFe2O4 surface across (011), (101), and (100) facets, alongside in vitro studies to assess drug loading and release, biocompatibility, and cytotoxicity on 4T1 cells. Molecular docking showed favorable binding energies between quercetin and BSA (−5.17 kcal mol−1 with Subdomain IIA), demonstrating that quercetin, even when bound to the BSA coating, retained strong interactions with the oxide surface. Reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis revealed facet-dependent adsorption mechanisms, correlating binding affinity towards Mn (through oxygen-containing functional groups) with steric interactions shown as red areas on the RDG plot. Analysis unveiled the interactions and structural features of each facet of the drug complex. Experimentally, the TEM imaging revealed the nanoparticles to possess a spherical morphology with an average diameter of around 7 nanometers and the average size of nanoparticles by DLS is 85.27 ± 0.26 nm with a PDI of 0.25. The BSA coating improved drug loading to 27.5% and resulted in a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on 4T1 tumor cells. Specifically, a release of 62% of the loaded quercetin was observed at pH 5.7 after 120 hours, compared to only 41% at pH 7.4. The in vitro assessment also demonstrated high biocompatibility, with less than 5% hemolysis observed at concentrations up to 200 μg mL−1. In vivo studies show no mouse death in the test of LD50. Overall, these findings support the potential of BSA-coated MnFe2O4 nanoparticles as a promising drug delivery platform to enhance quercetin's stability and bioavailability for effective tumor growth inhibition. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002408623,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, its short half-life, poor water-solubility, and low stability in vivo hinder its use. The development of injectable controlled release systems for ATRA delivery can potentially address these challenges. Building on a poly(caprolactone-co-lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(caprolactone-co-lactide) (PCLA-PEG-PCLA) triblock copolymer system that undergoes thermo-responsive gelation at 37 °C, we explore and compare different approaches to stabilize the gels through covalent bonding. The attempted cross-linking of methacrylate end-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA through thiol-Michael addition reactions using small molecule and 4-arm-PEG thiols led to precipitation rather than gelation. However, azide end-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA was gelled using 5 kg mol−1 4-arm-PEG with terminal dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBAC) groups by strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition. This hydrogel was then compared with previously reported methacrylate end-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA hydrogels cross-linked by free radical chemistry, as well as non-covalently cross-linked hydrogels. The azide-alkyne hydrogels exhibited properties intermediate between the free radical and non-covalently cross-linked gels. Incorporation of ATRA substantially disrupted the free radical cross-linking, but imparted only modest changes in the azide-alkyne gels. ATRA was released over about two weeks. The proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells in the presence of ATRA-loaded and control azide-alkyne gels was investigated.

Evidence suggests that children with an EA-SFK may have a higher risk of future kidney disease compared with those with a C-SFK, but the precise underlying mechanisms need further investigation. C-SFK was induced by fetal UNX at 100 days gestation (term=150 days) in male sheep fetuses, and a sham procedure was performed. At approximately one month of age, EA-SFK was induced by UNX in male lambs. At eight months of age, total kidney weight was similar in all groups due to marked hypertrophy in the C-SFK and EA-SFK groups. Blood pressure was similar in EA-SFK and sham groups but ~12 mmHg higher in the C-SFK group compared with sham. Compared with the sham group, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was ~9% less in the EA-SFK group and ~26% less in the C-SFK. GFR was ~23% higher in EA-SFK compared with the C-SFK group. Albuminuria was ~67% higher in C-SFK sheep but similar in the EA-SFK group compared with sham sheep. However, like the C-SFK group, the renal blood flow response to nitric oxide blockade was attenuated in the EA-SFK group compared with sham. In conclusion, long-term studies are needed to determine whether the higher hyperfiltration and disturbed vasodilator balance observed in EA-SFK sheep will cause an accelerated decline in renal function with aging. © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000796071,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Especially the protein and fluid interactions with the nitrocellulose membrane structure are yet to be fully investigated, which affect the fluid and protein distribution of the test and control lines differently due to different adsorptive properties of fluids and proteins. Therefore, the relationship between fluid spread and protein distribution, respectively, and structure needs systematic evaluation. Two procedures were developed based on passive adsorption of complementary fluorescent dyes to investigate these phenomena. These procedures enabled three-dimensional visualization of the membrane structure, fluid as well as the protein spreading, respectively. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was applied after depositing picoliter and nanoliter volumes of the printing buffers containing fluorophore-labeled proteins (immunoglobulin G) and Oregon Green™ 488 onto the membrane using a high precision micro dispenser. The resulting data were correlated with the membrane's tortuosity and permeability. Inverse-proportional dependencies for the lateral spread of the fluid and protein adsorption with the structural parameters were observed. Additionally, surfactants [polysorbate 80 (PS80) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), both at 0.1%] were added individually to the buffers, and the spread of the liquids was evaluated. Both surfactants increase the similarities between fluid and protein shape compared to the reference data. While SDBS increases the general lateral spread, PS80 does increase the penetration depth of the protein into the membrane, which could lead to reduced signal in LFAs. © 2025 Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000033880,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Inspired by TARE, we study the injection of fluid via a catheter in an idealized liver vasculature through experiments and lattice Boltzmann simulations. First, we validate the simulations using in vitro experiments of dye injected through a catheter. Then, we investigate the impact of catheter injection velocity on the distribution of injected fluid. The sensitivity of the distributions to changes in flow rate is low at catheter flow rates Q c ≤ 6 mL min − 1 and Q c ≥ 11 mL min − 1 , while in the intermediate regime, changes in flow rate of only 2 ml/min lead to changes in distribution of more than 50%. This is shown to originate from changes in the flow field in the first bifurcation. Specifically, the sensitivity to flow rate becomes large as the jet breakdown length approaches the distance to the first bifurcation. Our work represents a first step toward a fundamental understanding of the effect of injection velocity in TARE and similar applications. © 2025 Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002733636,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Accurate prognostic evaluation is essential in CRC patient management. This study investigates the prognostic significance of red blood cell count (RBC) and Onodera’s prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) in resectable CRC patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 210 CRC patients undergoing radical resection (January 2015–January 2017) assessed clinical and hematological factors, including RBC, albumin, hemoglobin, and OPNI. A novel comprehensive biomarker, R-OPNI, combining preoperative RBC with OPNI, was introduced. Correlations with patient survival were analyzed, and R-OPNI’s independent prognostic value was assessed through univariate and multivariate Cox models. Predictive ability was compared to other factors using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method. Results: Higher RBC levels (≥ 3.9 × 1012/L) and elevated OPNI were associated with significantly improved overall survival. Lower R-OPNI scores (0 or 1) indicated notably poorer survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed R-OPNI’s independent prognostic significance (HR: 0.273, 95% CI: 0.098–0.763, p = 0.013). R-OPNI (AUC = 0.732) demonstrated superior predictive value compared to individual prognostic factors.

This study aimed to determine the role of aggressive intravenous hydration with lactated Ringer’s solution at a specific volume with 20% human albumin before ERCP in reducing the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Methods: This study was a single-centre randomized clinical trial. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: those who received aggressive intravenous hydration with 20% human albumin and lactated Ringer's solution (intervention group), and those who received standard-volume intravenous hydration with lactated Ringer's solution (control group). The primary endpoint was post-ERCP pancreatitis. Participants and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation.

Sarcopenia, defined as reduced muscle strength and muscle quantity, has been seldom assessed in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. The aim of this study was to examine functional compromise in emergency laparotomy using sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and frailty parameters and evaluate impacts on functional and patient-centred outcomes. Methods: Patients aged greater than or equal to 55 years who underwent emergency laparotomy and preoperative computed tomography (CT) at two hospitals in New Zealand between February 2022 and October 2023 were included in a prospective database. Sarcopenia was measured using the SARC-F questionnaire, isokinetic dynamometry to measure hand grip strength, and skeletal muscle quantity according to CT. Myosteatosis was determined using CT and frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale. Predictors for rehabilitation, days alive and out of hospital at 90 days, and risk of not returning home were analysed using relative risk and proportional means regression. Secondary outcomes were 3- and 6-month mortality and inpatient morbidity defined using the Clavien–Dindo classification. Results: A total of 101 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy during the study interval were analysed; 21.6% of participants had sarcopenia, 34.7% had myosteatosis, and 24.8% were living with frailty. Muscle strength parameters (low grip strength and a positive SARC-F questionnaire) had significant relationships with primary outcomes. Low grip strength (less than 27 kg for male patients and less than 16 kg for female patients) was most significant for risk of admission for rehabilitation (adjusted risk ratio 5.48 (95% c.i. 2.03 to 14.82)). A positive SARC-F questionnaire (an overall score of greater than or equal to 4 out of 10) was most significant for not returning home (adjusted risk ratio 8.26 (95% c.i. 1.81 to 37.76)). Isolated low muscle quantity (less than 52.4 cm2/m2 for male patients and less than 38.5 cm2/m2 for female patients) demonstrated no relationship. Being frail was most significant for a reduced number of days alive and out of hospital at 90 days (−13.4% compared with non-frail participants (95% c.i. −24.3% to −0.8%)). Sarcopenia and low grip strength were the only parameters to demonstrate a relationship with 3- and 6-month mortality. Conclusion: Sarcopenia and frailty parameters are major determinants of functional compromise and predict adverse outcomes after emergency laparotomy. Muscle strength is more important than mass, and measurable without imaging, streamlining its clinical application. © The Author(s) 2025.

These calculations do not account for the variation seen in preanalytical conditions in routine practice or CVI in patients presenting for treatment. As a result, the RCVs may not reflect routine practice or align with clinicians’ experiences. We propose a novel RCV approach based on routine patient data that is potentially more clinically relevant. METHODS: This study used the refineR algorithm to determine RCVs using serial patient data extracted from a local Laboratory Information System (LIS). The model was applied to biomarkers with a range of result ratio distributions varying from normal to log-normal. Results were compared against conventional formula-based RCVs using CVI estimates from a state-of-the-art biological variation study. Monte Carlo simulations were also used to validate the LIS data approach. RESULTS: The RCVs estimated from LIS data were: 11-deoxycortisol (men): −70%/+196%, 17-hydroxyproges-terone (men): −49%/+100%, albumin: −10%/+11%, androstenedione (men): −47%/+96%, cortisol (men): −54%/+51%, cortisone (men): −32%/+51%, creatinine: −16%/+14%, phosphate (women): −23%/+29%, phosphate (men): −27%/+29%, testosterone (men): −38%/+60%. The formula-based RCV estimates showed similar but slightly lower results, and the Monte Carlo simulations confirmed the applicability of the new approach. CONCLUSIONS: RCVs may be estimated from patient results without prior assumptions about the shape of the ratios between serial results. Laboratories can determine RCVs based on local practice and population. © Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214089523,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Ahmed H.; Böhmdorfer M.; Jäger W.; Zeitlinger M.,Insights into interspecies protein binding variability using clindamycin as an example,2025,Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy,10.1093/jac/dkae412,"Background: In the preclinical development of new drugs, animal models are often employed to predict their efficacy in humans, relying on translational pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies. We performed in vitro experiments focusing on the comparison of plasma protein binding (PPB) and bacterial growth dynamics of clindamycin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent, across a range of drug concentrations and plasma environments. Methods: Human, bovine and rat plasma were used for determining PPB of clindamycin at various antibiotic concentrations in buffer and media containing 20% to 70% plasma or pure plasma using ultrafiltration (UF) and equilibrium dialysis (ED). Also bacterial growth and time–kill assays were performed in Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB) containing various percentages of plasma. Results: Protein binding of clindamycin correlated well between UF and ED. Notably, clindamycin exhibited substantially lower protein binding to rat plasma compared with human and bovine plasma. Staphylococcus aureus growth was significantly reduced in 70% human, bovine, and rat plasma after 4, 8 and 24 h compared with standard MHB. Time–kill data demonstrated that bacterial counts at both 20% and 70% plasmas were less when compared with MHB at drug concentrations lower than MIC after 4 and 8 h of incubation. For rat plasma, the difference was maintained over 24 h of incubation. Furthermore, a complete bacterial killing at 16 mg/L was observed after 24 h in 20% and 70% human and bovine plasma, but not for rat plasma. Conclusions: Recognizing interspecies differences in PB might be essential for optimizing the translational relevance of preclinical studies. © The Author(s) 2024.

Yet, studies had limitations regarding sample size, follow-up, and contemporary treatments. We evaluated the risk of T2D after BC overall, by cancer treatment, and compared with a matched cohort of cancer-free women. Methods: We assembled a population-based cohort of early-stage BC patients aged 30 years or more diagnosed during 1996-2021 in Denmark. We created a comparison cohort of 5 cancer- and T2D-free women for each BC patient, matched 6 months after BC diagnosis date on age and region. We followed both cohorts until T2D diagnosis, emigration, death, or December 31, 2022. We computed 5-year cumulative incidences and used Cox models to calculate time-varying adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of T2D. Results: Among 74 526 BC survivors and 372 630 matched cancer-free women, 5-year cumulative incidences of T2D were 3.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.7 to 3.9) and 3.3% (95% CI = 3.3 to 3.4), respectively. The aHR of T2D was elevated but attenuated over follow-up (aHR5-years = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.25, and aHR15-years = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.12). Adjuvant endocrine therapy (aHR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.19), aromatase inhibitors (aHR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.32), and less so tamoxifen (aHR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.99 to 1.11), were associated with elevated risk of T2D in women with BC vs cancer-free women. Among BC patients, chemotherapy (aHR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.17) and radiation therapy (right-sided aHR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.27 and left-sided aHR = 1.24, 95CI = 1.15 to 1.33) were associated with increased T2D risk. Conclusion: BC was associated with excess risk of T2D, although of lower magnitude than previously reported. The excess risk was temporary and related to BC treatment but could also be influenced by obesity and heightened T2D diagnostic activity. © The Author(s) 2024.

One possibility is differences in susceptibility to metallomic dysregulation. A previous study of the PDD brain identified substantive perturbations in metal levels, including severe multiregional decreases in Cu. The current work uses the same methods to ascertain whether this metallomic dysfunction is also present in the PD brain. To do this, tissue from 9 PD cases free of cognitive decline and 15 equivalent controls was obtained from 7 brain regions. Levels of Na, Mg, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Se were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine any potential confounder effects. Results were compared with those previously obtained for PDD. It was found that decreased Cu in the medulla was the only statistically significant case-control difference observed in the PD brain; this contrasts markedly with the widespread metallic dysfunction observed in PDD. PD and PDD cases were well separated by PCA analysis. In the PD cohort, tau Braak stage correlated with Cu concentrations in several regions, but these correlations were not retained when including PDD cases. There is a marked difference in the metallomic profiles of PD and PDD, with an almost complete lack of metallic involvement observed in the former. This resistance to metallomic dysfunction may contribute to resilience against cognitive impairment in individuals with PD who do not develop dementia.  © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000267255,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We use acoustic force spectroscopy to characterize the dynamics of transcription elongation in ternary elongation complexes (ECs) of RNAP in the presence of Stl at a single-molecule level. We found that Stl induces long-lived stochastic pauses while the instantaneous velocity of transcription between the pauses is unaffected. Stl enhances the short-lived pauses associated with an off-pathway early paused state intermediates of the RNAP nucleotide addition cycle. Unexpectedly, we found that transcript cleavage factors GreA and GreB, which were thought to be Stl competitors, do not alleviate the Stl-induced pausing; instead, they synergistically increase transcription inhibition by Stl. This is the first known instance of a transcriptional factor enhancing antibiotic activity. We propose a structural model of the EC-Gre-Stl complex that explains the observed Stl activities and provides insight into possible cooperative action of secondary channel factors and other antibiotics binding at the Stl pocket. These results offer a new strategy for high-throughput screening for prospective antibacterial agents. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214804433,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We show that the lack of BLM causes a decrease in the autophosphorylation of ATM in mice mammary glands, which have lost one or both copies of BLM. In isogenic human cells, the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway was dampened in the absence of BLM, which negatively affected the recruitment of DDR factors onto the chromatin, thereby indicating a direct role of BLM in augmenting DDR. Mechanistically, this was due to the BLM-dependent dissociation of inactive ATM dimers into active monomers. Fragmentation analysis of BLM followed by kinase assays revealed a 20-mer BLM peptide (91–110 aa), sufficient to enhance ATM-dependent p53 phosphorylation. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BLM at Thr99 within BLM (91–110) peptide enhanced ATM kinase activity due to its interaction with NBS1 and causing ATM monomerization. Delivery of phosphomimetic T99E counterpart of BLM (91–110 aa) peptide led to ATM activation followed by restoration of the DDR even in the absence of ionizing irradiation (both in cells and in BLM knockout mice), indicating its role as a DDR agonist, which can be potentially used to prevent the initiation of neoplastic transformation. © The Author(s) 2025.

We have developed the Beta Structure Selection (BeStSel) method (PNAS, 112, E3095), which solves the main problem of protein CD spectroscopy - namely, the spectral variability of β-structures. The BeStSel web server utilizes this method to provide tools to the community for CD spectrum analysis. BeStSel uniquely provides information on eight secondary structure components, including parallel β-structure and antiparallel β-sheets with three different twist groups. It outperforms all available methods in accuracy and information content, and is also able to predict protein folds down to the topology/homology level of the CATH classification. The algorithm has been further developed, and the accuracy of the estimation of the secondary structure elements is improved by 0.7% as an average on the reference dataset. A new module of the web server calculates protein stability from the thermal denaturation profile followed by CD. Secondary structure calculations of uploaded PDB and mmcif files support the experimental verification of MD simulations and AlphaFold models by CD spectroscopy. Well-proven modules for disorder-order classification and extinction coefficient calculation continue to work.

The impact of type Ⅰ and type Ⅱ DM on adverse postoperative outcomes, mortality, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and increased in-hospital costs following cervical fusion surgery remains unclear in the past decade. This study aims to determine the specific effect of different classifications of DM on postoperative complications in patients experiencing cervical fusion surgery. METHOD: Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was acquired between 2010 and 2019. Patients experiencing cervical fusion were included and classified as having type I DM, type II DM, or neither. Patient demographics, hospital characteristics, operative variables, comorbidities, complications, and other postoperative outcomes were assessed. Propensity score matching analysis was used to balance baseline differences. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were employed to determine the risk of postoperative outcomes in patients with different classifications of DM. RESULT: A total of 267 174 cervical spinal fusions were identified (224 255 were patients without DM, 670 patients had type I DM, and 42 249 patients had type II DM). After propensity score matching, the multivariate analysis of non-DM and type I DM patients shows a significant difference in pneumonia ( P =0.020). However, type Ⅱ DM served as an independent predictor of an increased risk of acute cerebrovascular disease ( P =0.001), acute myocardial infarction ( P =0.014), pneumonia ( P =0.045), continuous trauma ventilation ( P =0.016), chest pain ( P <0.001), urinary tract infection ( P <0.001), transfusion ( P =0.005) and dysphagia ( P =0.013), prolonged LOS ( P <0.001), and increased costs ( P =0.008). CONCLUSION: Using non-DM patients as a reference, the type II DM group demonstrated a higher risk of postoperative complications than the type I DM group among patients receiving cervical fusion surgery. This vital distinction could enhance risk stratification and guidance for patients diagnosed with DM before cervical fusion surgery. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

However, its role in cirrhosis has not been examined especially in low GFR. We analyzed the performance of CKD-EPI 2021 compared to other equations with protocol-measured GFR (mGFR) in cirrhosis. We analyzed 2090 unique adult patients with cirrhosis undergoing protocol GFR measurements using iothalamate clearance from 1985 to 2015 when listed for liver transplantation at Baylor University in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas. Using mGFR as a reference standard, the CKD-EPI 2021 was compared to CKD-EPI 2012, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-4, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-6, Royal Free Hospital, and GFR Assessment in Liver disease overall and in certain subgroups (ascites, mGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, diagnosis, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and gender). We examined bias (difference between eGFR and mGFR), accuracy (p30: eGFR within ± 30% of mGFR) and agreement between eGFR and mGFR categories. CKD-EPI 2021 had the second lowest bias across the entire range of GFR after GFR Assessment in Liver disease (6.6 vs. 4.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively, p < 0.001). The accuracy of CKD-EPI 2021 was similar to CKD-EPI 2012 (p30 = 67.8% vs. 67.9%, respectively) which was higher than the other equations (p < 0.001). It had a similar performance in patients with ascites, by diagnoses, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease subgroups, by gender, and in non-Black patients. However, it had a relatively higher overestimation in mGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 than most equations (18.5 mL/min/1.73m2, p < 0.001). Specifically, 64% of patients with mGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73m2 were incorrectly classified as a less severe CKD stage by CKD-EPI 2021. In Blacks, CKD-EPI 2021 underestimated eGFR by 17.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, which was higher than the alternate equations except for Royal Free Hospital (p < 0.001). The novel race-neutral eGFR equation, CKD-EPI 2021, improves the GFR estimation overall but may not accurately capture true kidney function in cirrhosis, specifically at low GFR. There is an urgent need for a race-neutral equation in liver disease reflecting the complexity of kidney function physiology unique to cirrhosis, given implications for organ allocation and dual organ transplant.

Pharmacokinetics (PK) data of iruplinalkib have been collected in healthy subjects and patient populations in several studies. We developed a population PK (PopPK) model for describing iruplinalkib plasma concentrations and for evaluating whether dose adjustments are necessary based on demographic factors or disease characteristics. Plasma concentration–time data were collected from 392 participants (16 healthy volunteers and 372 patients with solid tumors) who received single or multiple doses of iruplinalkib in four trials. Data were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Iruplinalkib plasma concentrations were best described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. Baseline body weight, time-varying albumin, time-varying creatinine clearance, and time-varying lactate dehydrogenase were significant covariates of apparent clearance from the central compartment (CL/F) while baseline body weight was a significant covariate of apparent volume of the central compartment (V1/F). Given the small or modest effect of all statistically significant covariates on iruplinalkib exposure at steady-state, no covariate was expected to have clinically meaningful effects on iruplinalkib exposure. Furthermore, iruplinalkib absorption was delayed 0.472 h after meal, and Ka was 58.8% of that under fasting. However, there was no difference in exposure of iruplinalkib between the fasted and fed states. In conclusion, the PopPK model adequately describes iruplinalkib PK properties in Chinese healthy subjects and patients with solid tumors. No covariate had a clinically meaningful impact on iruplinalkib exposure. These results indicate that dose adjustment of iruplinalkib is not necessary, based on the aforementioned covariates, for ALK-positive NSCLC patients. © 2024 Qilu Pharmaceutical Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.

Materials and Methods: Medical records were searched for dogs with histologically and immunohistochemically characterised nodular splenic lesions with mixed stromal, histiocytic and lymphoid cells and the presence of systemic inflammatory markers at the time of diagnosis. Results: Four dogs were included, of which three had an undifferentiated splenic stromal sarcoma and one had a splenic leiomyosarcoma. Fever and abdominal pain were reported in three and four cases, respectively. All dogs showed hyperglobulinaemia and marked changes in the serum protein electrophoresis profile. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen concentrations were both increased in three cases. These abnormalities completely resolved after splenectomy. Moreover, two dogs had concomitant glomerular disease and one dog had liver amyloidosis. Three dogs were still alive and asymptomatic 1, 6 and 9 months after surgery. One dog died 16 months after the initial presentation due to complications related to progressive renal failure. Clinical Significance: Based on this report, nodular splenic lesions with heterogeneous cell components may directly be associated with a pro-inflammatory state and should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of fever and hyperglobulinaemia in dogs. Furthermore, early recognition and treatment of these lesions could reduce the risk of systemic complications potentially associated with amyloid deposit and organ failure. © 2025 The Author(s).

Results Of the 422 samples, 401 study participants participated with a 95% response rate. 254 (63.3%) (95% CI 58.5, 68%) and 37% (95% CI 32.5, 42%) of the participants had good knowledge of diabetic retinopathy and good uptake of eye check-up service, respectively. Educational status of greater than 12th grade, possession of health insurance and good attitude towards diabetic retinopathy prevention were factors associated with good knowledge about diabetic retinopathy. In addition, urban residence, level of education of >grade 12, having health insurance, good knowledge of diabetic retinopathy and good attitude towards prevention of diabetic retinopathy were significantly associated with good utilisation of eye check-up services. Conclusions Compared with the WHO and other recommendations, diabetic patients have low knowledge and utilisation of eye check-up services for diabetic retinopathy. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

The growing burden of CAD in Asia and the emergence of novel CT-based risk markers highlight the need for an automated platform that integrates patient data with CCTA findings to provide tailored, accurate cardiovascular risk assessments. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform for CAD assessment using CCTA in Singapore’s multiethnic population. We will conduct a hybrid retrospective-prospective recruitment of patients who have undergone CCTA as part of the diagnostic workup for CAD, along with prospective follow-up for clinical endpoints. CCTA images will be analysed locally and by a core lab for coronary stenosis grading, Agatston scoring, epicardial adipose tissue evaluation and plaque analysis. The images and analyses will also be uploaded to an AI platform for deidentification, integration and automated reporting, generating precision AI toolkits for each parameter. Participants CCTA images and baseline characteristics have been collected and verified for 4196 recruited patients, comprising 75% Chinese, 6% Malay, 10% Indian and 9% from other ethnic groups. Among the participants, 41% are female, with a mean age of 55±11 years. Additionally, 41% have hypertension, 51% have dyslipidaemia, 15% have diabetes and 22% have a history of smoking. Findings to date The cohort data have been used to develop four AI modules for training, testing and validation. During the development process, data preprocessing standardised the format, resolution and other relevant attributes of the images. Future plans We will conduct prospective follow-up on the cohort to track clinical endpoints, including cardiovascular events, hospitalisations and mortality. Additionally, we will monitor the long-term impact of the AI-driven platform on patient outcomes and healthcare delivery. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211427987,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Early identification and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes. Identifying children at risk is challenging due to clinical heterogeneity and overlap with other conditions. Current evaluations of sepsis criteria adopt a variable-centred approach, evaluating each criterion independently. The objective of this study was to explore associations between patterns of sepsis screening criteria and sepsis risk in children screened in the emergency department (ED) to identify distinct profiles that describe the clinical heterogeneity of suspected sepsis. Methods This secondary analysis involved 3473 children screened for sepsis across 12 EDs in Queensland, Australia. Bayesian profile regression was used to construct data-driven clinical profiles derived from sepsis screening criteria and their association with suspected sepsis, defined as senior medical officer diagnosis and antibiotic administration in the ED. Posterior risk probabilities (Prs) with 95% credible intervals (CIs) were calculated for each profile. Profiles were internally validated by assessing their association with sepsis, septic shock, organ dysfunction and infection sources, in both adjusted and unadjusted models. Results Seven distinct clinical profiles were identified. Two profiles were labelled as high risk of suspected sepsis (profile 1, n=22: Pr 0.73, 95% CI 0.55, 0.89; profile 2, n=150: Pr 0.69, 95% CI 0.59, 0.80), four as moderate risk and one as low risk. High-risk profiles were characterised by severe illness indicators and elevated lactate levels. Moderate-risk profiles included criteria such as altered behaviour, young age (<3 months) and respiratory distress. High-risk profiles had strong associations with all clinical outcomes. Conclusions Seven clinical profiles were identified that varied in their risk of suspected sepsis and associated outcomes. Validation of these profiles in diverse populations and identification of which profiles are likely to benefit from certain interventions is needed. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007744949,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Sun L.; Liu Z.; Cui X.; Hu B.; Li W.; Pan Y.; Sun Y.; Wang Z.; Dong W.; Xu K.; Han L.; Zhang Y.; Zhao X.; Li Z.,Impact of prognostic nutritional index on mortality among patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a retrospective cohort study,2025,Heart,10.1136/heartjnl-2024-324471,"Background The Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), calculated from serum albumin levels and lymphocyte counts, is a simple and objective measure of nutritional status. While PNI has been shown to be a significant prognostic tool in gastrointestinal surgery and heart failure, its role in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate whether PNI can serve as a meaningful risk factor for patients undergoing CABG. Methods This observational retrospective analysis involved a substantial sample of 2889 patients who underwent isolated CABG at one of four medical centres. The primary outcomes included short- and long-term mortality. Perioperative serum albumin levels and total lymphocyte counts used to calculate PNIs were collected 48 hours before the operation, 24 hours after the operation and at discharge. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors of short-term mortality. Survival and relative risks were assessed using Cox regression analysis and the Kaplan-Meier test. Results Among the 2889 patients, 64 (2.2%) died within 30 days following CABG. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that higher preoperative PNI was independently associated with reduced short-term mortality (OR=0.852 per unit increase, 95% CI 0.802 to 0.904, p<0.001). Regarding long-term outcomes, among the 2825 patients who were discharged alive, 199 deaths occurred over a median follow-up period of 54.9 months. Patients with a normal PNI at discharge (>40) exhibited significantly higher long-term survival rates compared with those with a lower PNI (≤40) (log-rank p=0.003). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that a normal PNI at discharge(>40) independently predicted a lower risk of long-term all-cause mortality (HR=0.718, 95% CI 0.529 to 0.974, p=0.033). Conclusions PNI at various time points may play a crucial predictive role in mortality among CABG-treated patients, and a low PNI serves as a risk factor for both short- and long-term survival. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218108429,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to assess primary care adherence to guideline-recommended standards for patients with overlapping HF, CKD and T2D in England. Methods Using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1998-2020), we evaluated care adherence across 161 529 individuals with HF, CKD or T2D before and after developing a second of these conditions. We analysed disease investigation rates, medication use and predictors of guideline adherence. Results We identified 161 529 patients with CKD followed by HF (CKD+HF, 40%), CKD+T2D (51.3%) and HF+T2D (8.6%) with a median of 3.1 years follow-up after the second diagnosis. In CKD+HF, CKD+T2D and HF+T2D groups, prescription rates of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (71%, 64.1% and 74.4%), beta-blockers (53.1%,36.2% and 55.1%), antiplatelets (56.2%, 45.2% and 54.4%) and statins (56.7%, 68.5% and 72%) were suboptimal. Advanced age, female sex, peripheral arterial disease and cancer were associated with a lower likelihood of checking blood pressure, creatinine and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) after HF, CKD and T2D diagnoses, respectively. The first diagnosis of HF was associated with reduced odds of having HbA1C measured after T2D diagnosis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.86), compared with CKD as the first diagnosis. Conclusions In overlapping HF, CKD and T2D, guideline-recommended care is suboptimal, with inequalities by age, sex, disease on first presentation and comorbidities. Quality improvement requires linked data collection, monitoring and action across diseases. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000519095,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Here, we report a case of diabetes and obesity in a 56-year-old woman. She was diagnosed with severe obesity, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and a positive antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) test result at the age of 39 years. She developed diabetes 7 years later, meeting the diagnostic criteria for SPIDDM (probable). Despite high GADA levels, her endogenous insulin secretion has been preserved for over a decade. GADA has been regarded as a marker of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, and high levels of GADA are considered a risk factor for future insulin deficiency. However, the role of GADA in its pathogenesis remains unclear. GADA is not a specific indicator of autoimmune diabetes, as it is also positive for autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) and stiff-person syndrome. Therefore, a positive GADA test alone is not sufficient to predict insulin deficiency in an individual case, even if the titer is high. In the early stages, autoimmune diabetes presents clinical features similar to those of type 2 diabetes, particularly obesity. Although insulin therapy is often started early in the treatment of autoimmune diabetes, as the consensus statement indicates, when endogenous insulin secretion is preserved and the risk of insulin deficiency is low, efforts should be made to prevent body weight gain and the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) by following treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes, with the exception of the use of sulfonylurea agents.

Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted, and patients with a proven hemoglobinopathy diagnosis were included. Fasting blood was obtained to measure creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, uric acid, and ferritin. In addition, a 24-h urine specimen was collected to determine the level of urine albumin, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, uric acid, and β2-microglobulin. Fractional excretion of sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and uric acid was also calculated. Spearman’s coefficient of correlation was used to determine the correlations between serum ferritin level and other variables. Results: Of the sixty-six patients studied, 3.0% had sickle cell thalassemia, 80.3% had major thalassemia, and 72.7% had intermediate thalassemia. In our study, serum ferritin, 24-h urine protein, and fractional excretion of sodium, calcium, and urine were higher than the normal range in thalassemia patients. There was a significant correlation between serum ferritin level and fractional excretion of magnesium, calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and uric acid with a negative correlation coefficient (p ≤ 0.05). We also found that the serum ferritin levels strongly correlated with microalbuminuria (p ≤ 0.05). Copyright © 2025 Mohammad Tammadondar et al.

Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 150 T2DKD patients in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 2018 to December 2021. All patients received short-term CSII treatment and achieved the blood glucose target by adjusting insulin infusion. The patients’ daily insulin requirements during the treatment were recorded and analyzed. Result: There were 91 males and 59 females with an average age of 60.6 ± 10.6 years. Total daily insulin dose (TDD), total daily insulin dose per kilogram (TDD kg−1), total basal insulin dose per kilogram (TBa kg−1), and total bolus insulin dose per kilogram (TBo kg−1) fell with the decline of eGFR when achieving the blood glucose target except for the ratio of total basal insulin dose (TBD) to TDD (%TBa). Insulin requirement was less in patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.05). When achieving the blood glucose target, eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 group and eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 group were 0.71 ± 0.19 U/kg and 0.60 ± 0.24 U/kg, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that glycated hemoglobin and eGFR were independent factors associated with TDD kg−1. Conclusion: In patients with T2DKD who received short-term CSII therapy, the insulin requirement decline with the decrease of eGFR, while the %TBa did not change significantly. The dosage of insulin should be adjusted according to the level of eGFR in patients with T2DKD treated with CSII. Copyright © 2025 Qianqiu Feng et al.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complication in malaria-infected individuals with a high mortality rate (80% to 100%) and can occur before, during, or after antimalarial drug treatment. Although inflammation and epithelial/endothelial injury pathways have been determined through these studies, specific circulating malaria-associated ARDS markers have not yet been established. We applied a quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approach to identify altered molecular pathways in a mouse model of malaria-associated ARDS. Acute-phase response (APR) proteins were regulated in the ARDS group, suggesting their potential involvement in the development of the syndrome. They may serve as biomarkers when analyzed alongside other proteins that require further investigation. Additionally, the regulation of APR proteins in the ARDS group provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of ARDS, contributing to a better understanding of the syndrome.

Insulin icodec is a novel basal insulin designed for once-weekly administration. Methods: This study investigated the pharmacokinetic properties of icodec in children and adolescents with T2D aged 10 to < 18 years. Eighteen insulin-treated (daily basal insulin dose ≥ 0.2 U/kg) participants (11 females/7 males; mean ± standard deviation body mass index 38.5 ± 7.1 kg/m2, HbA1c 7.5 ± 1.3%) received a single subcutaneous injection of icodec (5.6 U/kg). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were drawn frequently until 35 days postinjection. Observed single-dose pharmacokinetic profiles were extrapolated to steady state using pharmacokinetic modeling. Results: One-week icodec pharmacokinetic profiles observed after a single dose and extrapolated to steady state suggest that icodec exposure covers the full weekly dosing interval in children and adolescents with T2D. After a single dose, geometric mean total exposure was 819∙105 pmol∙h/L [coefficient of variation (CV) 28.2%] and maximum concentration (Cmax) was 4.22∙105 pmol/L (CV 25.8%). Median time to maximum concentration (tmax) was 21 h (range 12–27 h). When extrapolated to steady state, geometric mean total exposure was 771∙105 pmol∙h/L (CV 29.9%) and maximum concentration was 6.35∙105 pmol/L (CV 27.3%). Median tmax was 15 h (range 13–19 h). In total, six adverse events (AEs) were reported in two participants. All AEs were mild and recovered/resolved. No serious or severe AEs, hypersensitivity or injection site reactions, or hyperglycemic episodes (plasma glucose > 14.0 mmol/L and blood ketones > 1.5 mmol/L) were reported. One level 1 hypoglycemic episode (plasma glucose < 3.9 and ≥ 3.0 mmol/L) was reported. Conclusion: Icodec was safe and well-tolerated in the current study in children and adolescents with T2D. The pharmacokinetic properties of icodec support its potential for once-weekly administration in children and adolescents with T2D. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05790681.

We conducted a phase I study of TTI-101, a first-in-class, selective small-molecule inhibitor of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, in patients with advanced metastatic cancer. Patients and Methods: Patients were treated with TTI-101 orally twice daily in 28-day cycles at four dose levels (DL): 3.2 (DL1), 6.4 (DL2), 12.8 (DL3), and 25.6 (DL4) mg/kg/day (“3+3” design). Three TTI-101 formulations were used in a stepwise manner (NCT03195699). Results: Sixty-four patients were treated (median age, 63 years; male sex, 52%; median number of prior therapies, 3). No dose-limiting toxicities or fatal treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were observed. Diarrhea (mostly grade 1/2) was the only TRAE observed in ≥30% of subjects. Five patients experienced grade 3 TRAEs that resolved. TTI-101 showed linear pharmacokinetics from DL1 to DL3, with the pharmacokinetics plateauing at DL3. The recommended phase II dose is 12.8 mg/kg/day (DL3). Of the 41 patients who were evaluable for response, five (12%) had confirmed partial responses (cPR) and 17 (41%) had stable disease. Three (18%) of the 17 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had a cPR (median time to treatment failure, 10.6 months). Two other cPRs were noted in one patient with ovarian cancer and one patient with gastric cancer. Conclusions: TTI-101 was well tolerated. cPRs were observed across tumor types. The antitumor activity of TTI-101 monotherapy in patients with advanced, metastatic solid tumors is promising.

Adipocytes are the main nonmalignant cells of the breast tumor microenvironment (TME). However, adipocyte metabolism is usually ignored in oncology, and the mechanisms that couple T2D to TNBC outcomes are poorly understood. In this study, we hypothesized that exosomes, small vesicles secreted by TME breast adipocytes, drive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in TNBC via miRNAs. Exosomes were purified from conditioned media of 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, either insulin-sensitive (IS) or insulin-resistant (IR). Murine 4T1 cells, a TNBC model, were treated with exosomes in vitro (72 hours). EMT, proliferation, and angiogenesis were elevated in IR versus control and IS. Brain metastases showed more mesenchymal morphology and EMT enrichment in the IR group. MiR-145a-3p is highly differentially expressed between IS and IR and potentially regulates metastasis. ©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007334553,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We studied genome landscapes, phylogenies, and clonal compositions of 91 PDACs in relation to clinicopathologic features. There was no difference in the number of driver mutations or evolutionary timing when each mutation occurred. High truncal density, a metric of the accumulation of somatic mutations in the lineage that gave rise to each PDAC, was significantly associated with worse overall survival. Polyclonal, monoclonal, or mixed polyclonal/monoclonal metastases were identified across the cohort, highlighting multiple forms of intertumoral heterogeneity. Advanced stage and treated PDACs had higher odds of being polyclonal, whereas oligometastatic PDACs had fewer driver alterations, a lower fractional allelic loss, and increased likelihood of being monoclonal. In sum, our findings reveal novel insights into the dynamic nature of the PDAC genome beyond established genetic paradigms. Significance: Although the pancreatic cancer genome has been described, it has not been explored with respect to stages of diagnosis or treatment bottlenecks. We now describe and quantify the genomic features of PDAC in the context of evolutionary metrics and in doing so have identified a novel prognostic biomarker. © 2024 The Authors.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218352677,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Maladaptive hypertrophy, podocyte stress, and depletion contribute to kidney function decline. Although insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) plays a key role in early hypertrophic responses in the single kidney state, its impact on kidney transplant (KTx) outcomes remains uncertain. This report tests the hypothesis that early IGF-1 exposure reduces KTx survival. METHODS. Population datasets compared incident death-censored graft failure (DCGF) rates by age at KTx (n = 366,404) with IGF-1 levels by age (n = 15,014). A clinical study of 216 KTx recipients evaluated the association of IGF-1 exposure with DCGF and secondary outcomes of proteinuria and biopsy-proven acute rejection. IGF-1 exposure was modeled using pre-KTx IGF-1 levels and donor kidney dose estimated from the donor/recipient body surface area ratio reflecting allograft hyperfiltration. The association of DCGF with an IGF1 SNP linked to high IGF-1 levels was assessed in 724 genotyped allograft recipients. Single-cell transcriptomic data from first-year post-KTx patients and binephric donors were compared to assess intrarenal cellular expression of IGF1, IGF1R, and growth hormone receptor (GHR) transcripts. RESULTS. DCGF risk by age at KTx paralleled IGF-1 levels by age. Higher IGF-1 exposure was associated with significantly increased risks of DCGF, proteinuria, and T cell–mediated rejection. Genotypic analysis showed a 50% increase in DCGF risk per risk allele at IGF1 expression quantitative trait locus rs35767. First-year biopsy results revealed no increase in intrarenal IGF1 transcripts, while GHR and IGF1R transcripts were suppressed, consistent with circulating IGF-1 (vs. graft-derived IGF-1) being the primary source of IGF-1 exposure. CONCLUSION. We identify a role for the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis in reducing KTx survival. © 2025, Cusick et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007944190,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Although IVF is viewed as largely safe, it is associated with adverse outcomes in the fetus, placenta, and adult offspring. Because studies focusing on the effect of IVF on the male reproductive system are limited, we used a mouse model to assess the morphological and molecular effects of IVF on male offspring. We evaluated 3 developmental stages: 18.5-day fetuses and 12- and 39-week-old adults. Regardless of age, we observed changes in testicular-to-body weight ratios, serum testosterone levels, testicular morphology, gene expression, and DNA methylation. Also, sperm showed changes in morphology and DNA methylation. To assess multigenerational phenotypes, we mated IVF-conceived and naturally conceived males with wild-type females. Offspring from IVF males exhibited decreased fetal-to-placental weight ratios and changes in placenta gene expression and morphology regardless of sex. At 12 weeks of age, offspring showed higher body weights and differences in glucose, triglyceride, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL/VLDL-C levels.

This study examined the underlying cellular mechanisms associated with insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic disease risk within subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in youth with obesity and IR compared with those without IR. METHODS. Thirteen adolescents who were insulin sensitive (IS) and 17 adolescents with IR and obesity underwent a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test and MRI to measure abdominal fat distribution and liver fat content. Lipolysis was determined by glycerol turnover ([2H5]-glycerol infusion) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) phosphorylation (Western blot) from SAT samples biopsied prior to and 30-minutes following insulin infusion during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC). RESULTS. Glycerol turnover suppression during the HEC (first step) was lower in participants with IR compared with those with IS. Prior to insulin infusion, activated ATGL (reflected by the p-ATGL (Ser406)-to-ATGL ratio) was greater in participants with IR compared with those with IS and suppressed in response to a 30-minute insulin exposure in participants with IS, but not in those with IR. Lastly, greater ATGL inactivation is associated with greater glycerol suppression and lower liver fat. CONCLUSIONS. Insulin-mediated inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis via ATGL is dysregulated among adolescents with IR compared with those with IS, thereby serving as a vital mechanism linking glucose and insulin dysregulation and ectopic lipid storage within the liver. © 2025, Slusher et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000732966,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

While most hypertriglyceridemia is asymptomatic, hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis (HTGAP) can be more severe than AP of other etiologies. The reasons underlying this are unclear. We thus examined whether lipolytic generation of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) from circulating triglycerides (TGs) could worsen clinical outcomes. METHODS. Admission serum TGs, NEFA composition, and concentrations were analyzed prospectively for 269 patients with AP. These parameters, demographics, and clinical outcomes were compared between HTG-AP (TGs >500 mg/dL; American Heart Association [AHA] 2018 guidelines) and AP of other etiologies. Serum NEFAs were correlated with serum TG fatty acids (TGFAs) alone and with the product of TGFA serum lipase (NEFAs - TGFAs × lipase). Studies in mice and rats were conducted to understand the role of HTG lipolysis in organ failure and to interpret the NEFA-TGFA correlations. RESULTS. Patients with HTG-AP had higher serum NEFA and TG levels and more severe AP (19% vs. 7%; P < 0.03) than did individuals with AP of other etiologies. Correlations of long-chain unsaturated NEFAs with corresponding TGFAs increased with TG concentrations up to 500 mg/dL and declined thereafter. However, NEFA - TGFA × lipase correlations became stronger with TGs above 500 mg/dL. AP and intravenous lipase infusion in rodents caused lipolysis of circulating TGs to NEFAs. This led to multisystem organ failure, which was prevented by pancreatic TG lipase deletion or lipase inhibition. CONCLUSIONS. HTG-AP is made severe by the NEFAs generated from intravascular lipolysis of circulating TGs. Strategies that prevent TG lipolysis may be effective in improving clinical outcomes for patients with HTG-AP.

Methods: A qualitative study with individual semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 adults (8 women, ages 45-74 years) with type 2 diabetes. Purposive sampling was used, and participants from 3 different intervention groups in the micro-choice-based concentrated group intervention were recruited. Thematic analysis was used for the data analysis. Results: Three main themes were identified: (1) group intervention tailored to individual needs through friendly and skilled professionals, (2) valuable social interactions and an experience of fellowship, and (3) commitment to change through goal setting and conscious micro-choices. The participants described a readiness for change that was met by important knowledge from skilled professionals in the concentrated intervention. They reported that new knowledge, particularly about micro-choices and the focus on how insulin works in the body, led to change in their awareness and self-management. The concentrated group intervention was a preferred setting that contained a sense of community without compromising on meeting individual needs. Participants described internalized changes after the intervention and a willingness to adhere to changes necessary for their self-management. Conclusion: Study findings showed that a micro-choice-based concentrated group intervention for people with type 2 diabetes can be a valuable approach contributing to improved patient activation and diabetes self-management. The findings underpin the importance of increased diabetes knowledge and support from an interprofessional team to bring about significant changes in everyday life. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216967256,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This finding is intriguing because CHO cells do not generate α2-6 sialylation, which constitutes the majority of human pdVWF sialylation. We hypothesized that glycan differences might regulate the longer half-life of CHO-rVWF. In lectin plate-binding assays and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis, we confirmed that CHO-rVWF lacked α2-6–linked sialylation. Conversely, however, α2-3–linked sialylation was significantly increased on CHO-rVWF, which also had reduced exposed β-galactose (β-Gal) compared to pdVWF. Consistent with human data, CHO-rVWF clearance was significantly (P < .001) reduced in VWF–/– mice compared to pdVWF. However, clearance of asialo-pdVWF and asialo–CHO-rVWF were identical. In keeping with the in vivo half-life prolongation, CHO-rVWF binding to murine macrophages (P = .012) and HepG2 cells (P = .001) was significantly decreased compared to pdVWF. Furthermore, CHO-rVWF binding to purified macrophage-galactose-type lectin (MGL) receptor and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) was also significantly reduced. In contrast to pdVWF, in vivo studies in MGL1–/– mice and Asgr1–/– mice demonstrated that neither MGL nor ASGPR plays significant roles in regulating CHO-rVWF clearance. Together, our findings demonstrate that enhanced α2-3–linked sialylation on CHO-rVWF is responsible for its extended half-life. © 2025 American Society of Hematology",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002662423,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Several prognostic markers have been associated with CAR T-cell outcomes, such as tumor burden, response to bridging chemotherapy, and laboratory parameters at the time of lymphodepletion or infusion. The effect of cancer cachexia and weight loss before CAR T cells on toxicity and outcomes is not well understood. Here, we present a retrospective single-institution cohort study of 259 patients with lymphoma treated with CAR T cells between 2017 and 2023. We observed that patients with >5% decrease in their body mass index in the 3 months preceding CAR T-cell treatment (weight loss group; all meeting one of the commonly accepted definitions of cancer cachexia) had higher disease burden and inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α) at the time of lymphodepletion and CAR T-cell infusion. Patients with weight loss experienced higher rates of grade 3+ neurotoxicity and early hematotoxicity, but those effects were not seen upon multivariable adjustment. However, in both univariate and multivariable analysis, patients with weight loss had worse response rates, overall survival, and event-free survival, indicating that weight loss is an independent poor prognostic factor. Our data suggest that weight loss in the 3 months preceding CAR T-cell therapy represents a worrisome “alarm signal” and a potentially modifiable factor, alongside tumor burden and inflammation, and warrants further investigation in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. © 2024 by The American Society of Hematology.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215275184,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to investigate the association of these novel antihyperglycaemic drugs versus metformin with fewer COPD exacerbations in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) comorbid with COPD. Methods Using the national administrative database covering 99% of the medical facilities in Japan, we constructed three active comparators new-user cohorts comprising 36 317 patients with T2DM and COPD who initiated treatment with the novel antihyperglycaemic drugs and metformin between 2014 and 2022. Patients’ backgrounds were balanced using overlap propensity score weighting. We calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the initial occurrence of COPD exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model. Results DPP-4 Is were associated with a higher incidence of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (22.4 versus 20.4 per 100 person-years; HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07–1.25) compared with metformin. In contrast, the incidence of such exacerbations in the GLP-1 RAs (30.1 versus 24.4 per 100 person-years; HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87–1.32) and SGLT-2 Is (20.7 versus 21.8 per 100 person-years; HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94–1.06) groups were comparable with that in the metformin group. Conclusions While DPP-4 Is were associated with poorer control of COPD compared with metformin, GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 Is offered COPD control comparable with that of metformin. © The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007362097,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The CD131 receptor is indispensable for signalling by the β common (βc) family of cytokines encompassing granulocyte−macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-3, which instigate both type-2 and non-type-2 inflammatory responses. This study aims to determine whether antagonising CD131 signalling can prevent pulmonary inflammation, alveolar cell death and emphysema development. Methods We performed in-house and in silico transcriptomic analysis to investigate the gene expression of CD131 (CSF2RB) and pathway enrichment for βc cytokine signalling in blood, sputum and lung biopsies of COPD patients. To model emphysema, transgenic mice expressing human CD131 were exposed to elastase or cigarette smoke (CS) and a fully human monoclonal antibody (CSL311) was employed to inhibit CD131 signalling. Results CD131 gene expression was significantly increased in COPD, along with an enrichment of gene set for βc cytokine signalling. In transgenic mice subjected to emphysema models, CD131 antagonism effectively prevented lung injury, alveolar cell death and emphysema development. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing identified pathway enrichment for myeloid cell activation, type-2 immune response and macrophage alternative activation in elastase-induced emphysematous mice, mirroring human COPD. Blocking CD131 signalling almost completely reversed the global gene expression alterations associated with emphysema development. Conclusions CD131 signalling orchestrates pulmonary inflammation in COPD, resulting in immunopathology that underpins emphysema and lung function decline. Antagonising CD131 therefore represents a unique strategy to simultaneously target multiple pathogenic myeloid cell populations. © The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009237968,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Measuring N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels is diagnostically useful, but the optimal cut-off point must be determined. This study aimed to optimise NT-proBNP cut-offs for diagnosing HF-related PEs and develop a scoring model to improve diagnostic precision. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 2005 patients with PEs, who were divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified the optimal cut-off point for NT-proBNP in pleural fluid and serum. A scoring system was developed based on logistic regression (TRIPOD statement) that included both clinical and laboratory variables. Its diagnostic accuracy was compared with that of existing methods using the area under the curve (AUC). Results NT-proBNP ⩾2500 pg·mL−1 was found to be the optimal cut-off for identifying HF-related effusions. Pleural fluid NT-proBNP levels tended to have superior diagnostic accuracy compared with serum NT-proBNP levels. A scoring system, denominated as BANCA (bilateral effusions on chest radiographs, age, NT-proBNP levels in pleural fluid, cholesterol in pleural fluid, and albumin gradient), demonstrated an AUC of 0.957, outperforming existing diagnostic criteria for identifying cardiac effusions. In cases misclassified as exudates by Light’s criteria, the BANCA score accurately identified 80% of the HF-related PEs. Conclusions The BANCA score is a reliable tool for diagnosing HF-related PEs, offering superior accuracy compared with conventional methods. It is particularly useful for identifying cardiac effusions that are misclassified using traditional criteria. ©The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011862779,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Although the clinical symptoms of T1DM differ from those of MS, such as pancreatic β-cell failure in T1DM and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) in MS, both pathologies are considered as autoimmune-related diseases with shared pathogenic pathways, which include autophagy, inflammation and degeneration, among others. Considering the challenges in obtaining pancreatic β-cells and CNS tissue from patients with T1DM and MS, respectively, it is fundamental to explore alternative methods for evaluating disease status. Proteomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is an ideal approach for identifying novel and potential biomarkers for both autoimmune diseases. Methods: We conducted a proteomic analysis of PBMCs from patients with T1DM and relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis (herein forth MS) patients (n = 9 per condition), using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach. The patients were diagnosed following the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for T1DM and McDonald criteria for MS respectively, and were aged over 18 years and more than 2 years from the onset respectively. Results: A total of 2476 proteins were differentially expressed in PBMCs from patients with T1DM and MS patients compared with those form healthy controls (H). Predictive analysis highlighted 15 common proteins, up- or downregulated in PBMCs from patients with T1DM and MS patients vs. healthy controls, involved in the immune system activity (BTF3, TTR, CD59, CSTB), diseases of the neuronal system (TTR), signal transduction (STMN1, LAMTOR5), metabolism of nucleotides (RPS21), proteins (TTR, ENAM, CD59, RPS21, SRP9) and RNA (SRSF10, RPS21). In addition, this study revealed both shared and distinct molecular patterns between the two conditions. Conclusions: Compared with H, patients with T1DM and MS presented a specific expression pattern of common proteins has been identified. This pattern underscores the shared mechanisms involved in their immune responses and neurological complications, alongside dysregulation of the autophagy pathway. Notably, CSTB has emerged as a differential biomarker, distinguishing between these two autoimmune diseases. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217661590,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Using pleural fluid characteristics, pleural infection can be classified into microbiological-positive pleural infection (MPPI) and microbiological-negative pleural infection (MNPI). This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of microbiological positivity in pleural infection, and to evaluate the performance of RAPID (renal, age, purulence, infection source, dietary factor) score in these subgroups. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized for pleural infection over a 10-year period in two acute-care hospitals in Hong Kong were evaluated. According to the pleural fluid characteristics, they were classified into MPPI and MNPI, respectively. Survival was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Performance of RAPID score to predict mortality at 3-month and 1-year was evaluated using C-statistics. Results: In total, 381 patients with pleural infection were included. They were classified into MPPI (n = 169) and MNPI (n = 212), respectively. The MPPI group had more elderly home residence and use of large-bore chest tube, and higher Charlson comorbidity index and RAPID score, compared to the MNPI group. Length-of-stay, the need of surgery and intensive care were similar between the two groups. MPPI was associated with significantly increased risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.46, 95% CI 1.08–1.98). Three-month mortality was significantly higher in MPPI compared to MNPI (24.9% vs. 10.4%, p < 0.001; adjusted odd ratio 2.05, 95% CI 1.11–3.80). The trend continued at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years. RAPID score predicted 3-month and 1-year mortality in both groups (C-statistics, MPPI 0.71, 0.75; MNPI 0.84, 0.81). In the MPPI group, presence of Staphylococcus aureus (aHR 2.26, 95% CI 1.43–3.57) and Gram-negative organisms other than Enterobacteriaceae (aHR 2.00, 95% CI 1.10–3.61) were associated with worse survival, while presence of Streptococcus anginosus group was associated better survival (aHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32–0.78), when compared to their absence. Conclusions: Pleural fluid microbiological positivity is independently associated with increased mortality in patients with pleural infections. This finding should complement the RAPID score in risk stratification and inform future research aimed at improving outcomes in this patient population. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218413948,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Obesity-mediated metabolic abnormalities are one of the mechanisms that link asthma and obesity. While maternal obesity contributes to obesity and respiratory morbidity in the child, the contribution of paternal obesity and parental metabolic abnormalities to the child’s asthma is not known. Methods: To quantify the impact of parental and child’s body weight and metabolic traits, including elevated HbA1c, and blood cholesterol levels based on national, age-specific cut-off values, on asthma exacerbations, control, and severity, in a Danish nationwide cohort of 29,851 children aged 2–17 years with inhaled corticosteroid-treated asthma during 2015–17. Results: Among the 29,851 children, 1,430 had severe asthma, 4,750 had poor asthma control, and 2,353 had exacerbating asthma. Elevated LDL in the child was associated with 2.2-fold higher odds of severe asthma and elevated triglycerides with 1.5-fold higher odds of exacerbating asthma, while reduced HDL was associated with 1.5-fold higher odds of poor control. Both triglycerides and HDL were associated with 1.5-fold higher odds of exacerbating asthma. Maternal parameters including elevated LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1C were associated with 1.2 to 1.4-fold higher odds of uncontrolled asthma in the child. Elevated paternal HbA1C was associated with exacerbating asthma. Conclusion: Dyslipidemia, including elevated LDL and decreased HDL, in the child and their parents was associated with high asthma burden in a Danish pediatric cohort with persistent asthma. These observations highlight the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms driven by fat metabolism that are transgenerational. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010627702,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Identifying prognostic biomarkers may improve risk stratification and guide personalized interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term prognostic value of circulating biomarkers related to inflammation, metabolic stress, and organ damage in individuals with T2D. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on a cohort of 478 individuals with T2D, followed for a median of 16.1 years. Ten circulating biomarkers (IL-6, IL-10, CD163, CXCL9, CCL22, GDF15, IL-33, FGF21, Follistatin, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were quantified using an automated immunoassay platform. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess their prognostic significance for all-cause mortality. A biomarker-based scoring model was developed by integrating independent predictors of mortality. Predictive performance was evaluated in comparison with the RECODe equation, a validated risk model for diabetes complications and mortality. Results: Deceased individuals exhibited significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10, CXCL9, FGF21, NfL, and GDF15. Biomarker levels correlated with both microvascular and macrovascular complications, particularly neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, four biomarkers emerged as independent predictors of mortality: CXCL9 (HR per 1 SD increase 1.19, 95% CI 1.05–1.36, p = 0.006), GDF15 (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.33, p = 0.032), NfL (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09–1.43, p = 0.001), and FGF21 (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04–1.37, p = 0.009). A composite biomarker score (range: 4–12) stratified individuals into distinct risk categories, with each 1-point increase in the score associated with a 55% higher mortality risk (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.35–1.74, p < 0.001). The biomarker score remained independently predictive after adjusting for clinical covariates and significantly improved individual-level risk classification beyond the RECODe model, as demonstrated by net reclassification and discrimination improvement metrics. Conclusions: These findings suggest that inflammatory and metabolic stress-related biomarkers independently predict long-term mortality in T2D. The biomarker-based scoring model enhances risk stratification and improves the prognostic performance of existing clinical tools, such as the RECODe equation, potentially informing targeted clinical interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010228810,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a key antigen in vaccine design. However, its low immunogenicity has been a hurdle, resulting in the production of minimal anti-RBD antibodies even when combined with alum adjuvant. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), secreted by Gram-negative bacteria, are nanospherical structures that can display or deliver antigens while also providing adjuvant activity through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Results: In this study, we utilized the SpyTag (ST)/SpyCatcher (SC) bioconjugation system to couple OMV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD in vitro. We successfully prepared a ‘plug-and-display’ nanovaccine OMV-RBD, which demonstrated good safety profiles and promoted the uptake of antigens by DCs and the maturation of BMDCs by activating TLR3 and NOD2 signaling pathways. Both intranasal and intramuscular immunization with OMV-RBD vaccine elicited robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Importantly, the induced antibodies effectively inhibited the binding of RBD to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. Conclusions: This vaccine platform offers an alternative strategy for developing recombinant subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, potentially enhancing immune responses and improving vaccine efficacy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218083107,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

AGuIX-Bi represents a theranostic NP comprising gadolinium and bismuth chelates grafted on a polysiloxane core. We hypothesize that modulating the surface of AGuIX-Bi with targeted peptides will enhance the therapeutic responses of radiation therapy. The cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) peptide has a high affinity to RGD-binding integrins overexpressed on various tumor cells, including lung cancer. In the present study, we introduced cRGD peptides onto the surface of AGuIX-Bi NPs using a PEG spacer to form an amide bond with the free amino functions present at the surface of the NPs. In vitro, AGuIX-Bi-cRGD showed enhanced internalization of NPs via integrin binding and increased radiosensitization. In murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors, AGuIX-Bi-cRGD exhibited increased accumulation and retention in tumors without causing systemic toxicity. Combined with fractionated irradiation, AGuIX-Bi-cRGD converted a “cold” LLC tumor microenvironment (TME) into a “hot” one by inducing the overexpression of the immunogenic cell death marker HMGB1 and increasing the density of tumor-infiltrating CD3+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and thereby delaying tumor growth and improving mice survival. Therefore, these results suggest a potential strategy for using targeted AGuIX-Bi-cRGD NPs to sensitize lung tumors to radiation and immunotherapies. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009542541,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Nevertheless, the role of lipids in the early steps of carcinogenesis is unknown. Although we previously identified two types of pancreatic fatty infiltration with different lipid compositions that were associated with precancerous lesions and fibrosis, their mechanisms of action have not been clarified. Methods: We hypothesized that saturated palmitic acid and mono-unsaturated oleic acid (OA and PA) could play diverse roles in the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) during the genesis of pancreatic fibrosis and the promotion of precancerous lesions. This study explored the lipotoxic effect of OA and PA on PSCs and exocrine pancreatic tissue (acinar cells). We also explored PA-induced pyroptosis in PSCs. A three-dimensional culture system of organotypic slices from human pancreatic tissues was used as well as a two-dimensional culture of hTERT immortalized PSCs. Results: The results show that PA could induce the secretion of collagens and inflammatory cytokines (IL18) in PSCs (p < 0.05). We defined a standardized protocol of precision-cut pancreas slices cultured from human non-tumoral pancreatic tissue (n = 9). Both OA and PA are involved in the initiation of acinar cell transformation into ductal cells. OA was found to have a protective effect against PA-induced fibrosis (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results highlight the antagonistic roles of oleic and palmitic acids in the initiation of pancreatic fibrosis and show that palmitic acid has a profibrotic role. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002969085,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Outcomes are heterogeneous, and accurate risk stratification is important to identify the highest risk individuals for treatment and to help prevent disease progression. The Oxford classification (OC) is an internationally adopted standard for renal biopsy reporting in IgAN, which measures the degree of histological abnormalities and predicts prognosis. The kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) was developed to predict kidney failure in all causes of CKD and has been shown to be highly accurate across diverse etiologies. This review aimed to compare the KFRE with formulae incorporating the OC in accurately determining the risk of kidney failure in IgAN. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane library guidelines and PRISMA statement for reporting of systematic reviews. Studies comparing the accuracy of the KFRE with the OC in predicting disease progression and kidney failure in IgAN were evaluated. The search strategy and analysis were performed independently by two reviewers. Studies that were eligible for inclusion compared the KFRE with any tool incorporating the OC in a cohort of individuals with IgAN. Eligible outcomes were reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and prognostic tools were required to assess the accuracy of these formulae by discrimination and/or calibration. Results: After searching several databases, only one study was eligible for inclusion in the review. This study of 2300 Chinese individuals with IgAN had a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Two-hundred eighty-eight individuals had a composite outcome of 50% decline in eGFR or ESRD, and 214 individuals developed ESRD. Both the KFRE and the IgAN Risk Prediction (IRP) tool (incorporating the OC) were highly accurate at predicting ESRD with a C-statistic of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. Subgroup analysis demonstrated improved performance of IRP over KFRE in discrimination for individuals with preserved eGFR (> 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) at baseline. The risk of bias was high due to insufficient follow-up and handling of missing data, so overall confidence in findings is very low. Conclusion: There is currently insufficient evidence to compare the accuracy of the KFRE and OC in determining outcomes in IgAN. Further research is required in this field.

However, similar progress has not been observed in India, with induction mortality rates surpassing those in high-income countries. Our patient population also differs significantly from those in clinical trials, with about 50% ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Yet, because of limited access to newer therapies and high costs, most of these patients receive intensive therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS In this study, we retrospectively classified patients who received intensive induction into fit and unfit groups on the basis of landmark trial criteria. Data were extracted from the Indian Acute Leukemia Research Database, a prospective registry maintained under the Hematology Cancer Consortium. The primary objective was induction mortality.RESULTS We analyzed 385 patients with AML treated between 2017 and 2019. The median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range, 15-61). Induction mortality was reported at 6.1% in the fit cohort and 20.2% in the unfit cohort (odds ratio, 3.91 [1.97-7.74]; P <.0001). Factors such as increased age, poor performance status, baseline infection, and low albumin were associated with a poor prognosis for early death. After a median follow-up of 19.2 months, the 2-year overall survival in the overall, fit, and unfit cohorts was 62.7%, 67%, and 58.1%, respectively.CONCLUSION Our findings highlight the baseline characteristics of our patient population and their impact on the outcomes of induction therapy. Unfit patients who received intensive chemotherapy had higher induction mortality and lower overall survival. © 2025 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000000355,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between GAP versus GC. Median OS with GAP was 14.0 months (95% CI, 12.4 to 16.1) and 13.6 months with GC (95% CI, 9.7 to 16.6); hazard ratio (HR), 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.14); P =.41. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was similar between groups with median PFS for GAP being 7.5 months (95% CI, 6.4 to 8.5) versus 6.3 months for GC (95% CI, 4.4 to 8.2); HR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.12); P =.32. In exploratory subset analyses, the OS and PFS benefits of GAP versus GC treatment were greater in locally advanced disease compared with metastatic disease, although not statistically significant (interaction P =.14 for OS and P =.17 for PFS). Moreover, GAP versus GC showed greater improvement in PFS among participants with GBC than those with ICC or ECC (interaction P =.01), but not OS (interaction P =.28).CONCLUSIONThe addition of a taxane in the GAP regimen to the standard gemcitabine-cisplatin regimen did not improve OS in newly diagnosed BTC.

Kappa free light chain (KFLC) quantification in serum and CSF has recently been proposed as an additional test. In a rational medicoeconomic approach, identifying algorithms or biomarkers is important. The objective of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the correlation between CSF kappa free light chain (KFLCCSF)/total CSF protein ratio (KFLCCSF/ProtCSF) and OCB status and its performance in diagnosing MS. Methods KFLC measurements were performed prospectively with each OCB analysis, and the data were interpreted retrospectively. A total of 814 clinical cases were included: 153 with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 181 with other inflammatory neurologic diseases, and 480 with noninflammatory neurologic diseases. Performances of KFLCCSF/ProtCSF in predicting OCB status, diagnosing MS, and estimating evolution of CIS to MS were evaluated and compared with those of other KFLC parameters, i.e., KFLC index, and with OCB and IgG parameters. Results KFLCCSF/ProtCSF and KFLC index performed similarly in predicting OCB status, with a sensitivity of 80.2% and a specificity of 93.4% at a threshold >0.21% for KFLCCSF/ProtCSF (area under the curve: 0.93). The percentage of agreement between OCB status and KFLCCSF/ProtCSF was 91.2%. Using KFLCCSF and KFLCCSF/ProtCSF initially could reduce OCB testing by 68% and quantitative tests by 48.4%. For diagnosing MS/CIS, KFLCCSF/ProtCSF performed similar to or slightly worse than the KFLC index but always outperformed IgG, OCB, and KFLCCSF. For this indication, the optimal threshold for KFLCCSF/ProtCSF was >0.24%. It is important to note that KFLCCSF/ProtCSF was the most predictive parameter for CIS progression to MS. Discussion To conclude, KFLCCSF/ProtCSF is as an easier and cost-effective alternative for predicting OCB status and CIS progression to MS and assisting in the diagnosis of MS. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class II evidence that the KFLCCSF/ProteinCSF ratio accurately distinguishes patients with CSF OCBs from those without CSF OCBs and patients with MS from those with other neurologic disorders. © 2025 The Author(s).

Because FcRn is a multifunctional protein expressed in different immune system cells, including B cells, we investigated whether FcRn blockade by EFG may have further immunologic effects, other than IgG reduction, in patients with MG.MethodsAnti-acetylcholine receptor Ab-positive (AChR-MG) patients were treated with EFG according to the GENERATIVE protocol. Clinical evaluation, IgG and autoAb quantification, and circulating T-cell and B-cell subpopulation analyses by flow cytometry were performed at different time points. The expression of regulatory plasma cell-related candidate genes (CD38, lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG3], IL-12a, Ebi3) was assessed by real-time PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients on treatment and in PBMCs either untreated or in vitro treated with an EFG-mimicking anti-FcRn monoclonal Ab (mAb) or with EFG (Vyvgart).ResultsA significantly increased percentage of CD19+/CD27+ memory B cells and CD27+/CD138+ plasma cells was observed at the end of EFG treatment cycle 1 and cycle 2 in patients with AChR-MG. Plasma cell increase, maintained up to cycle 3, significantly correlated with Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score improvement. Moreover, PBMCs from EFG-treated patients showed overexpression of CD38, LAG3, and IL-12a genes, suggesting EFG's ability to induce non-pathogenic regulatory plasma cells. This ability was confirmed in vitro, because anti-FcRn mAb-treated and EFG-treated PBMCs displayed an up-regulation of CD38 and LAG3 compared with untreated cells.DiscussionOur findings indicate an unknown immunoregulatory action of EFG in patients with AChR-MG, by unraveling a drug effect on B-cell differentiation, and suggest the induction of regulatory plasma cells as a further mechanism, beyond IgG reduction, associated with clinical improvement. A deep understanding of the immunologic effects of EFG can help to optimize its usage over time in individual patients and disclose biomarkers suitable for monitoring the long-term patient-specific response.  © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012305493,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In this study, we aimed to investigate the natural course of the function of lower extremity small and large nerve fibers in people with NGT and its decline in those with well-controlled type 2 diabetes. Methods This prospective observational study assessed changes in nerve function in participants of the German Diabetes Study with recently diagnosed (≤1 year) type 2 diabetes and age-matched and sex-matched individuals with NGT after 5 years and in a larger group of participants with type 2 diabetes after 5 and 10 years. Reference tests of lower extremity peripheral nerve function included peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), malleolar vibration perception threshold (VPT), and thermal detection thresholds (TDTs). Data were analyzed using multiple linear or logistic regression analyses. Results At baseline, all 5 nerve function measures showed impairment in the 52 individuals in the diabetes group (33% female, median age 51.7 years) compared with the 52 individuals in the matched NGT group (33% female, median age 51.4 years). After 5 years, 2 nerve indices declined in the diabetes group (peroneal MNCV and VPT) and 3 in the NGT group (peroneal MNCV, VPT, and TDT for cold), with similar 5-year declines observed in both groups after adjustment for baseline values and pairwise matching. In addition, the Neuropathy Disability Score increased in the NGT group but not in the diabetes group. Comparable patterns of decline after 5 and 10 years were found in the larger diabetes cohort of 141 individuals (39% female, median baseline age 53.6 years). The observed 10-year prevalence of abnormal NCVs closely matched estimates based on natural aging-related decline (14.2% vs 12.8% for peroneal MNCV and 30.2% vs 31.0% for sural SNCV). Discussion These findings suggest that nerve function deterioration in well-controlled type 2 diabetes is primarily influenced by nerve function status at diagnosis and physiologic aging, rather than diabetes-related progression.

Methods: This study included 300 HCC patients who underwent TACE treatment. Based on whether persistent albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade deterioration (PABD) occurred after the initial TACE, defining as a shift in ALBI grade to a higher grade from baseline without recovery within 90 days, patients were divided into PABD and non-PABD groups. Overall survival of non-PABD and PABD groups according to subgroups stratified by baseline ALBI grade and tumour burden was compared with that of patients receiving only sorafenib or supportive care during the same period. Results: Repeat TACE provided a survival benefit over systemic therapy or supportive care for patients in all post-TACE non-PABD or most PABD subgroups, regardless of baseline liver condition (ie, modified albumin–bilirubin [mALBI] grade and tumour burden). This benefit was absent in two subgroups among patients who developed PABD after the initial TACE, namely, (1) those with a baseline liver condition of mALBI grade 1 or 2a and tumour burden exceeding the up-to-11 criteria, and (2) those with a baseline liver condition of mALBI grade 2b, regardless of tumour burden. Conclusion: Repeat TACE is not recommended for patients with persistent liver function deterioration after the initial TACE, particularly those exhibiting suboptimal baseline liver function or excessive tumour burden. Understanding the liver condition and tumour burden in HCC patients may assist clinicians in planning optimal treatment strategies, leading to better prognosis. ©2025 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219612859,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Previous research linked PFAS exposure to female reproductive disorders, but the mechanism remains elusive. Further, most studies focused on legacy long-chain PFOA and PFOS, yet the reproductive impacts of other long-chain PFAS and short-chain alternatives are rarely explored. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of long-and short-chain PFAS on the mouse ovary and further evaluated the toxic mechanisms of long-chain perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). METHODS: A 3D in vitro mouse ovarian follicle culture system and an in vivo mouse model were used, together with approaches of reverse transcription– quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), pharmacological treat-ments, in situ zymography, histology, in situ hybridization, analytical chemistry, and benchmark dose modeling (BMD). Using these approaches, a wide range of exposure levels (1–250 lM) of long-chain PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFNA) and short-chain PFAS (PFHpA, PFBS, GenX) were first tested in cultured follicles to examine their effects on follicle growth, hormone secretion, and ovulation. We identified 250 lM as the most effective concentration for further investigation into the toxic mechanisms of PFNA, followed by an in vivo mouse exposure model to verify the accumulation of PFNA in the ovary and its ovarian-disrupting effects. RESULTS: In vitro cultured ovarian follicles exposed to long-but not short-chain PFAS showed poorer gonadotropin-dependent follicle growth, ovulation, and hormone secretion in comparison with control follicles. RT-qPCR and RNA-seq analyses revealed significant alterations in the expression of genes involved in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)–dependent follicle growth, luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated ovulation, and associated regulatory pathways in the PFNA-exposed group in comparison with the control group. The PPAR agonist experiment demonstrated that a peroxisome proliferator– activated receptor gamma (PPARc) antagonist could reverse both the phenotypic and genotypic effects of PFNA exposure, restoring them to levels compa-rable to the control group. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that PFNA could accumulate in ovarian tissues and validated the in vitro findings. The BMD, in vitro, and in vivo extrapolation analyses estimated follicular rupture as the most sensitive end point and that observed effects occurred in the range of human exposure to long-chain PFAS. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates that long-chain PFAS, particularly PFNA, act as a PPARc agonist in granulosa cells to interfere with gonadotropin-dependent follicle growth, hormone secretion, and ovulation; and exposure to high levels of PFAS may cause adverse ovarian out-comes. © 2025, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Epidemiological studies have linked environmentally relevant levels of BPA exposure to obesity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to uncover the complex mechanisms by which oral exposure during pregnancy with BPA affects the offspring. METHODS: We conducted a two-stage mouse study. In stage 1, we gavaged dams with BPA at 0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg/kg per day during pregnancy, and we tracked the offspring’s weight and diet to 12 wk of age. In stage 2, exosomes from BPA-exposed dams and offspring were injected into pregnant mice and 3-wk-old males, respectively, and the mice were observed up to 12 wk. We then sequenced exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in male offspring whose dams had been exposed to BPA during pregnancy and checked their expression in adipose, liver, and serum samples at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Finally, we explored the functions of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs secreted by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and we investigated whether the exosomes and miRNAs they secreted could affect glucose uptake, triglyceride synthesis, and the expression of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism in alpha mouse liver 12 cells. RESULTS: Gavage of 0:05 mg/kg per day of BPA during pregnancy in dams led to obesity in male offspring mice, and injection of exosomes from male offspring with BPA exposure during pregnancy also induced similar outcomes in the next generation of male pups. Exosomal miRNA sequencing identified differentially expressed miRNAs associated with BPA-induced obesity in male offspring, revealing sustained high expression of miRNAs in adipose tissue and a gradual increase in the liver and serum over time. Further mechanistic studies showed that exosomes derived from BPA-treated adipose-derived stem cells reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and fibroblast growth factor 21, leading to impaired insulin signaling and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. Overexpression of miR-124-3p in hepatocytes mimicked these effects; in contrast, knockdown of miR-124-3p or inhibition of exosome secretion reversed them. DISCUSSION: The present study corroborates the regulatory function of adipose-derived exosomal miRNAs in obesity in male offspring mice resulting from BPA exposure during pregnancy. Exosomal miRNA may be a key and novel molecular biomarker in the adverse effects of chemical exposure during pregnancy. © 2025, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are a complex set of modified proteins or lipids by non-enzymatic glycosylation and oxidation. The formation of AGEs is irreversible, and they accumulate in tissues with increasing age. Currently, AGEs, as a biomarker of ageing, are viewed as a risk factor for sarcopenia. AGE accumulation could cause harmful effects in the human body such as elevated inflammation levels, enhanced oxidative stress, and targeted glycosylation of proteins inside and outside the cells. Several studies have illustrated the pathogenic role of AGEs in sarcopenia, which includes promoting skeletal muscle atrophy, impairing muscle regeneration, disrupting the normal structure of skeletal muscle extracellular matrix, and contributing to neuromuscular junction lesion and vascular disorders. This article reviews studies focused on the pathogenic role of AGEs in sarcopenia and the potential mechanisms of the detrimental effects, aiming to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and develop novel methods for the prevention and therapy of sarcopenia. © 2025 Guo et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001931381,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Existing detection methods, such as qPCR and ELISA, fail to simultaneously meet the requirements for high sensitivity, high specificity, and rapid detection. This study presents an innovative approach for the rapid, specific, and highly sensitive detection of pathogenic microorganisms, particularly Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), by combining recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The qualitative and quantitative detection method for pathogenic microorganisms was developed and evaluated. The stable and efficient RPA reaction systems were established to specifically amplify the key conserved genes of these pathogens. Then the RPA products were purified, and enriched with MBs. The absorbance spectra were obtained using THz-TDS technology. The linear range of the RPA-THz for detecting E. coli O157:H7 was 0.55 to 5.5 × 104 pg/mL, while for VZV, it was 0.75 to 7.5 × 103 pg/mL. The limit of detection (LOD) for bacteria and viruses was 0.226 pg/mL and 0.528 pg/mL, respectively, demonstrating better sensitivity than the qPCR (550 pg/mL and 750 pg/mL, respectively). In addition, the whole amplification and detection process was completed in about 35 minutes. Compared to traditional pathogen detection techniques, the primary advantage of the developed RPA-THz method exhibited high accuracy, good reproducibility, and short detection times, enabling non-ionizing, label-free analysis for rapid detection with high sensitivity and specificity of pathogenic microorganisms. This study provides a theoretical foundation and practical demonstration for the fast and precise detection of pathogenic microorganisms. It establishes a crucial research basis for further development of RPA-THz sensors, advancing technological progress in the field of food safety, medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and public health. © 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219116911,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study aimed to uncover the relationship between scrub typhus and autoimmune responses, focusing on antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and the implications of elevated ANA titers during infection. Method Data from a total of 139 patients diagnosed with scrub typhus and 30 healthy controls were retrospectively analyzed through serum samples to assess the levels of ANAs and related autoantibodies. The study further examined the temporal variation of these antibody titers in relation to post-symptom progression and evaluated their association with clinical and laboratory parameters. Results The study results detail significant differences in autoimmune responses between scrub typhus patients and healthy controls. ANA titers above 1:80 were detected in 71.2% of patients; these titers were elevated in only 13.3% of the healthy controls. High-titer positivity (1:640 or higher) was observed exclusively in the scrub typhus group. The distribution of ANA titers revealed a progressive increase in mean ANA and double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid Immunoglobulin M (anti-dsDNA IgM) titers as the duration after symptom onset increased, indicating an augmented immune response over time. This trend was observed along with a systematic elevation in median anti-dsDNA IgM titers, highlighting the dynamic nature of immune responses in scrub typhus infection. Conclusion Our findings conclude a substantial autoimmunological reaction in scrub typhus patients, suggesting potential mimicry of autoimmune conditions like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. These results underline the complex interplay between infectious diseases and autoimmunity, emphasizing the necessity for further research into these mechanisms and their clinical implications. © 2025 You et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217357698,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Canadian Medical Association Journal,10.1503/cmaj.240922,"Background: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD), sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve renal outcomes, but may transiently affect biochemical markers of CKD–mineral and bone disorders (CKDMBD). We sought to evaluate the longterm risk of CKDMBD associated with use of SGLT2 inhibitors in this patient population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, employing a target trial emulation framework and using electronic medical records of patients from 9 hospitals in Taiwan (2016–2023). We included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1–3 CKD who had newly started either an SGLT2 inhibitor or, as a comparison group, a glucagonlike peptide1 receptor agonist (GLP1 RA). The primary outcome was a composite of incident biochemical abnormalities (serum phosphate > 1.5 mmol/L, serum calcium < 2.1 mmol/L, serum intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] > 6.9 pmol/L, or serum 25hydroxyvitamin D < 49.9 nmol/L). R e s u l t s: T h e c o h o r t i n c l u d e d 13 379 patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 11 920) or GLP1 RAs (n = 1459) with a median followup of 3.3 years. Compared with GLP1 RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a lower cumulative incidence of the composite primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–0.86), hyperphosphatemia (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76–0.91), hypocalcemia (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.78–0.86), high serum iPTH levels (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.57–0.78), and low serum 25hydroxyvitamin D levels (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47–0.90). Interpretation: Use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a lower incidence of biochemical abnormalities related to CKDMBD than GLP1 RAs. These agents may be considered to reduce risk of CKDMBD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1–3 CKD. © 2025 CMA Impact Inc.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219415198,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Kulkarni K.; Hussain T.,Megalin A Sidekick or Nemesis of the Kidney?,2025,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology,10.1681/ASN.0000000572,"Megalin is an endocytic receptor in the proximal tubules that reabsorbs filtered proteins in the kidneys. Recycling of megalin after endocytosis and its expression on the apical plasma membrane of the proximal tubule are critical for its function. The expression of megalin in the kidney undergoes dynamic changes under physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. Receptors and various effector signaling components regulate megalin expression and, potentially, function. Genetic manipulation and rare mutations in megalin suggest that a lack of or deficiency in megalin expression/function promotes tubular proteinuria and albuminuria. However, the role of megalin in kidney diseases associated with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and nephrotoxicity remains unclear. To address these questions, animal and human studies have indicated megalin as a protective, injurious, and potentially urinary marker of nephropathy. This article reviews the literature on the regulation of megalin expression and the role of megalin in the pathophysiology of the kidney under experimental and clinical conditions. Moreover, this review articulates the need for studies that can clarify whether megalin can serve as a therapeutic target, in one way or the other, to treat kidney disease. © 2024 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210978980,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Recently, a US real-world study found statistically significant improvements in A1c levels among patients using GLP-1 RA and a CGM device, compared with a matched cohort receiving only GLP-1 RA. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness from a US payer perspective of initiating CGM (FreeStyle Libre Systems) in people living with T2DM using a GLP-1 RA therapy, compared with GLP-1 RA alone. METHODS: A patient-level microsimulation model was run for 10,000 patients over a lifetime horizon with 3.0% discounting for costs and utilities. Patient characteristics were based on the overall population of the US real-world study and the subgroup of patients not using intensive insulin. The effect of CGM was modeled as a persistent reduction in A1c compared with GLP-1 RA alone (overall=0.37%; patients not using intensive insulin=0.34%). Costs ($2,023) and disutilities were applied to diabetes complications and acute diabetic events. Outcomes were assessed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (incremental costs/incremental QALYs) for GLP-1 RA plus CGM vs GLP-1 RA alone was $40,968/QALY in the overall cohort (cost=$484,180 vs $473,938; QALYs=13.37 vs 13.12). Among patients not using intensive insulin, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $43,095/QALY. Scenario analysis showed that the model results were robust to changing assumptions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that GLP-1 RA plus CGM had a 64% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: From a US payer perspective, CGM is cost-effective when added to GLP-1 RA therapies for the treatment of T2DM, including for patients not using intensive insulin.

Traditional socket prostheses remain the rehabilitation standard, although transcutaneous osseointegration for amputees (TOFA) is proving a viable alternative. Limited studies of TOFA for vascular amputees have been published, but no study has focused on TOFA for patients with DM, neglecting this important patient population. The primary aim of the present study exploring this potential care option was to report the frequencies and types of adverse events following TOFA for patients with well-controlled DM. The secondary aims were to report their mobility and quality-of-life changes. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of 17 consecutive patients with well-controlled DM who had undergone unilateral transfemoral TOFA from 2013 to 2019 and had been followed for at least 2 years. Outcomes were perioperative complications, additional surgery (soft-tissue refashioning, debridement, implant removal, periprosthetic fracture treatment), mobility (daily prosthesis wear hours, K-level, Timed Up and Go Test, 6-Minute Walk Test), and patient-reported outcomes (Questionnaire for Persons with a Transfemoral Amputation, Short Form-36). Results: There were no perioperative systemic complications, deaths, or proximal amputations. Two patients (12%) sustained a periprosthetic fracture following a fall, managed by internal fixation with implant retention, and regained independent ambulation. Eight patients (47%) had additional surgery or surgeries for non-traumatic complications: 4 (24%) had soft-tissue refashioning, 3 (18%) had debridement, and 3 others had implant removal with subsequent revision osseointegration for aseptic loosening (1) or infection (2). The proportion of patients wearing their prosthesis at least 8 hours daily improved from 5 (36%) to 11 (79%) of 14 (p = 0.054). The proportion of patients who achieved at least K-level 2 improved from 6% to 94% (p < 0.001). Other changes were not significant. Conclusions: Contraindicating TOFA for all patients with DM seems draconian. Patients with well-controlled DM experienced significant mobility improvements, although additional surgery was somewhat common. Improvements in selection criteria or surgical technique to reduce risks are needed so that TOFA can be routinely considered for amputees with well-controlled DM.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D (VitD) supplementation on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in CHF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Methods: A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in HFrEF patients. Patients were randomized to receive two doses of 200,000 IU VitD3 (VitD group) or saline solution (placebo group) at a two-week interval. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and renin concentrations were assessed at baseline and one month after the first dose. The primary outcome was plasma renin change. The study was registered at the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry as PACTR201908774181973. Results: Forty patients in each group completed the trial. At baseline, hypovitaminosis D and hyperreninemia were found in 85% and 77.5% of patients, respectively, with no differences between VitD and placebo groups. VitD supplementation resulted in an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the VitD group, only. In parallel, plasma renin decreased in the VitD group [renin change: median (25th percentile; 75th percentile), -34.9 (-110; -7.1)], but did not change in the placebo group [1.35 (-1.2; 8.8)]. No significant changes were found for clinical, echocardiographic, and other biochemical parameters in both groups. Conclusions: A mega-dose of vitamin D resulted in middle-term RAAS suppression but didn’t affect cardiac function and clinical features in HFrEF patients. Further research with longer follow-ups is needed to evaluate whether persistent adequate VitD status results in long-term RAAS suppression and cardiac function improvement. © 2025 HBKU Press.

Little is known, however, about the immediate regulation of islet hormonal output by nicotine, an agonist of ionotropic cholinergic receptors. We investigated this by imaging cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics in mouse and human islets using confocal microscopy and measuring glucagon secretion in response to the alkaloid from isolated mouse islets. Nicotine acutely stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ in glucagonsecreting α-cells but not in insulin-secreting β-cells. The 2.8-± 0.5-fold (P < 0.05) increase in Ca2+, observed in >70% of α-cells, correlated well with a 2.5-± 0.3-fold stimulation of glucagon secretion. Nicotine-induced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ relied on influx from the extracellular compartment rather than release of the cation from intracellular depots. Metabotropic cholinergic signaling, monitored at the level of intracellular diacylglycerol, was limited to 69% of α-cells versus 94% of β-cells. We conclude that parasympathetic regulation of pancreatic islet hormone release uses different signaling pathways in β-cells (metabotropic) and α-cells (metabotropic and ionotropic), resulting in the fine-tuning of acetylcholine-induced glucagon exocytosis. Sustained nicotinic stimulation is, therefore, likely to attenuate insulin sensitivity by increasing glucagon release. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213393784,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

AGEs represent a potential target to prevent or treat diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN). The current study aimed to characterize cutaneous carbonyl stress, oxidative stress, immune cells, and endothelial cell damage in early type 2 diabetes compared with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) using novel cutaneous biomarkers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Included were 160 individuals recently (≤12 months) diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 144 with NGT from the German Diabetes Study baseline cohort. Nerve function was assessed using electrophysiological, quantitative sensory, and clinical testing. Skin biopsies were obtained to analyze intraepidermal nerve fiber density, AGE autofluorescence, argpyrimidine area, and endothelial cell area. In addition, skin autofluorescence was measured noninvasively using the AGE reader. A subgroup with type 2 diabetes (n = 80) was reassessed 5 years later. RESULTS After adjustment for sex, age, HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, and BMI, argpyrimidine area (17.5 ± 18.8 vs. 11.7 ± 12.7%) was higher in recent-onset type 2 diabetes than in NGT (P < 0.05). AGE autofluorescence was inversely correlated with nerve conduction (e.g., peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity: r = 20.346) and pos-itively with AGE reader measurements in type 2 diabetes (r = 0.358, all P < 0.05), but not in NGT. Higher baseline AGE autofluorescence and lower endothelial cell area predicted the deterioration of clinical and neurophysiological measures after 5 years. CONCLUSIONS Cutaneous AGE markers were associated with neurophysiological deficits in re-cent-onset type 2 diabetes and predicted their progression after 5 years, substan-tiating the role of carbonyl stress in the development of early DSPN. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216715184,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Trzebiatowski L.; Georgiev P.; Büttner K.; Wehrend A.,Influence of different processing methods on anti-trypsin activity in bovine colostrum,2025,JDS Communications,10.3168/jdsc.2024-0678,"Colostrum is important for supplying the bovine neonate with nutrients, bioactive substances, and immunoglobulins to acquire passive immunity. Trypsin inhibitory activity represents a general characteristic of the first bovine colostrum. It is assumed that the anti-trypsin activity serves to protect bioactive molecules in the colostrum from being digested by the calf. The objectives of the study were to establish a test to determine anti-trypsin activity and test the hypothesis that freezing, acidification, and heat treatment alter anti-trypsin activity compared with untreated bovine colostrum. A photometric assay was established to determine anti-trypsin activity. The activity was expressed in milligrams of inhibited trypsin per milliliter of colostrum. Anti-trypsin activity was measured in untreated colostrum, frozen colostrum (−20°C for 24 h), colostrum acidified using 10% formic acid in a way that it was present as 1% in the sample, and colostrum heat treated according to 2 different protocols (60°C for 60 min and 63.5°C for 30 min). In our study, trypsin inhibition in 40 untreated colostrum samples (0.80 mg/mL, SEM 0.03) corresponded to that observed in frozen colostrum samples (0.79 mg/mL, SEM 0.03). In these first analyzed 40 and 59 extra samples (in total 99 samples), the anti-trypsin activity of frozen colostrum (0.85 mg/mL, SEM 0.01) was compared with colostrum subjected to acidification (0.84 mg/mL, SEM 0.01), heat treatment at 60°C for 60 min (0.65 mg/mL, SEM 0.02), and heat treatment at 63.5°C for 30 min (0.61 mg/mL, SEM 0.02). Acidification did not significantly affect trypsin inhibition. Both heat treatment protocols significantly reduced anti-trypsin activity. In the future, when investigating the effects of postharvest storage and processing on bovine colostrum, the influence on anti-trypsin activity should be evaluated in addition to the effects on immunoglobulins and other components. © 2025",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003920165,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, its relationship with gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Multiple online bioinformatic tools were used to evaluate the messenger (m)RNA expression levels of SH3BGRL3 in GC using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry were performed to assess SH3BGRL3 expression in relation to clinicopathological parameters and outcomes in patients with GC. Significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of SH3BGRL3 were enriched and visualized. Furthermore, associations between the expression of SH3BGRL3 and the infiltration of immune cells were explored. SH3BGRL3 exhibited aberrant expression in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues at the mRNA and protein expression levels, especially in Epstein-Barr virus-negative GC (EBVnGC). Higher SH3BGRL3 expression was significantly associated with increasing tumor-node-metastasis staging, tumor budding, perineural invasion, EGFR expression, and a notably higher preoperative blood glucose concentration in clinical specimens. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher SH3BGRL3 expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor for the overall survival of patients with EBVnGC (hazard ratio, 1.666; P=0.018). Furthermore, the stratified analysis revealed that the SH3BGRL3 phenotype could help to refine prognosis in patients. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.740 when combining SH3BGRL3 with other clinicopathological parameters, which indicated a good model for clinical follow-up decisions. Gene functional enrichment analysis also revealed that the DEGs of SH3BGRL3 were mainly enriched in regulating ATP metabolism, ATP synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain in GC. Moreover, a higher SH3BGRL3 expression was significantly positively correlated with the infiltrating macrophages in GC. In conclusion, SH3BGRL3 is upregulated in GC, particularly in EBVnGC. Higher SH3BGRL3 expression is closely associated with hyperglycemia and poor outcomes in patients with EBVnGC, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and prognostic predictor.  © 2024 Li et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209723771,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Ye D.; Jiang W.; Gu D.,Association Between Platelet-Albumin-Bilirubin Grade and the 30-Day Mortality in Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Evidence from the MIMIC-IV Database,2025,Balkan Medical Journal,10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2024.2024-8-7,"Background: The platelet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI) grade is a comprehensive assessment index of liver function. Liver dysfunction is a key determinant of the pathogenesis and resolution of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which affects the prognosis of patients. Aims: To evaluate the association of PALBI grade with the risk of 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between PALBI grade and the 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS; results were described as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This association was further assessed by subgroup analyses stratified based on age, sex, and complications. Results: A total of 2,841 patients with ARDS were included, of whom, 703 (24.74%) died within 30 days. After adjusting all covariates, a higher PALBI grade was associated with higher odds of 30-day mortality (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.05-2.29). High PALBI grade was related to higher odds of 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS aged ≥ 65 years (HR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.06-5.01), males (HR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.29-3.44), without sepsis (HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.11-2.64), without pneumonia (HR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.19-2.91), and without any history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.28-2.91). Conclusion: The PALBI grade was positively associated with 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS. The present study provides a reference for risk stratification management of patients with ARDS to improve short-term prognosis. © Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214756236,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Hulbert L.; Mensa-Wilmot Y.; Rutledge S.; Owens-Gary M.; Skeete R.; Cannon M.J.,"Interests and Preferences in Programs to Improve Health Among Men With or at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes in Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups, 2019",2025,Preventing Chronic Disease,10.5888/PCD22.240268,"Introduction Men in racial and ethnic minority groups are less likely than non-Hispanic White men to participate in programs designed to improve health, despite having a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes. We sought to understand 1) the interests and preferences of racial and ethnic minority men, with or at risk for type 2 diabetes, in programs designed to improve health and 2) factors that influence participation and health practices. Methods We designed a 43-question web-based survey on facilitators and barriers to participation in a healthy living program. The survey was administered from August 27, 2019, through September 3, 2019. Our analytic sample consisted of 1,506 men at risk for or diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in racial and ethnic minority groups. We conducted descriptive and regression analyses of survey data. Results Most men (59%) were interested in participating in a healthy living program and/or program elements such as incentives (67%), male-specific health topics (57%), and the inclusion of family (63%). Flexibility was important, since “exercising when it is convenient for me” was the most frequently selected facilitator of physical activity and “the hours were inconvenient” was identified as a challenge in previous programs. Men in this survey were significantly more likely to be interested in participating in a health improvement program for several reasons, including if they were physically active 150 minutes or more per week (vs not) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6–3.0) and had previously been in a healthy living program (vs not) (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.1). Conclusion Our findings can be useful for recruiting and retaining racial and ethnic minority men with or at risk for type 2 diabetes in programs designed to improve health and ultimately reduce disparities in the prevalence of diabetes. © (2025), (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)).

Tian F.; Chen Z.; Zhang Y.; Feng Q.; Chen X.,Impact of Chinese criteria on potentially inappropriate medication use in China,2025,Journal of Global Health,10.7189/JOGH.15.04063,"Background In 2018, China issued a set of criteria for effectively identifying and managing potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use in older adults. However, there is currently a lack of evidence regarding the impact of these criteria on PIM use among older Chinese adults. Methods We used interrupted time series analysis on the prescription data of older outpatients from 59 hospitals in six major geographic regions of China to compare changes in the overall prevalence of PIM use, the prevalence of PIM use stratified by different numbers of PIMs, and the prevalence of top five PIMs (i.e. clopidogrel, estazolam, zolpidem, sliding-scale insulin, and alprazolam) from 2015 (before) to 2021 (after) the release of criteria in 2018. Results We included 982605 older outpatients. Compared with trends prior to the publication of the criteria, there were significant decreases in the coefficient for change in the slope of the overall prevalence of PIM use (β = −0.607; 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.881, −0.482; P < 0.001), the prevalence of single PIM use (β = −0.368; 95% CI = −0.465, −0.272; P < 0.001), the prevalence of multiple PIM use (β = −0.104; 95% CI = −0.173, −0.080; P = 0.019), the prevalence of clopidogrel (β = −0.342; 95% CI = −0.463, −0.227; P = 0.006), and the prevalence of estazolam (β = −0.077; 95% CI = −0.124, −0.037; P = 0.009) post-publication. Conversely, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of zolpidem, after the criteria were released (β = 0.030; 95% CI = 0.002, 0.057; P = 0.036). Conclusions We found that the release of criteria for effectively identifying and managing PIM use has had a positive effect on its prevalence among older outpatients in China. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218290572,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
"H.M., Sinclair, Hugh M.",The vitamin B complex,1941,Postgraduate Medical Journal,10.1136/pgmj.17.183.3,"1. Four members of the vitamin B complex are believed to be important in human nutrition: vitamin B1, nicotinic acid, riboflavin and vitamin B6. All have been synthesized. 2. Deficiency of vitamin B1 causes disorders of the nervous and cardio-vascular systems which in their extreme forms constitute beriberi. The symptoms and signs of deficiency are briefly described. The causes of deficiency are discussed, and the frequency of mild states of deficiency in this country is emphasized. 3. Nicotinic acid cures pellagra-a disease found more commonly in this country than is generally supposed; the symptoms and nature of the disease are briefly discussed. 4. Deficiency of riboflavin causes cheilosis and seborrhcea around the nose. 5. There is an ill-defined relation between the vitamin B complex and anaemia. 6. The members of the vitamin B complex are probably parts of enzymes or coenzymes necessary for the respiration of ceVtain cells. In their absence the metabolism of the cell becomes deranged. Yeast is a convenient therapeutic source of the vitamin B complex. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906418107,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
