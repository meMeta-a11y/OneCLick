Developed in the US in 2001, its accuracy in contemporary non-US contexts is unclear. Objective: To evaluate the external validity of the Walter Index in predicting posthospitalization mortality risk in Brazilian older adult inpatients. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study used data from a cohort of adults aged 70 years or older admitted to the geriatric unit of a university hospital in Brazil from January 1, 2009, to February 28, 2020. Participants underwent comprehensive geriatric assessments at admission, were reevaluated at discharge, and were subsequently followed up for 48 months. Data were analyzed from March to July 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures: The Walter Index, a score based on 6 risk factors (male sex, dependent activities of daily living at discharge, heart failure, cancer, high creatinine level, and low albumin level), was calculated to assess its predictive accuracy for 12-month mortality as well as 6-, 24-, and 48-month mortality. The study investigated whether incorporating delirium, frailty, or C-reactive protein level enhanced accuracy. Performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility measures. Results: In total, 2780 participants (mean [SD] age, 81 [7] years; 1795 [65%] female) were included, with 89 (3%) lost to follow-up. The 12-month posthospitalization mortality rate was 23% (646 participants). Mortality was 7% (47 of 634) in the lowest-risk group (0-1 point), 17% (111 of 668) for 2 to 3 points, 25% (198 of 803) for 4 to 6 points, and 43% (290 of 675) in the highest-risk group (≥7 points). The index demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.714 (95% CI, 0.691-0.736) for predicting 12-month posthospitalization mortality (AUCs were 0.75 and 0.80 in the original derivation and validation cohorts, respectively). Comparable results were observed for mortality at 6 months (AUC, 0.726; 95% CI, 0.700-0.752), 24 months (AUC, 0.711; 95% CI, 0.691-0.730), and 48 months (AUC, 0.719; 95% CI, 0.700-0.738). Adding delirium modestly increased the index's discrimination (AUC, 0.723; 95% CI, 0.702-0.749); additionally including frailty and C-reactive protein level did not improve discrimination further (AUC, 0.723; 95% CI, 0.701-0.744). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prognostic study of hospitalized older adults in Brazil, the Walter Index showed similar discrimination in predicting postdischarge mortality as it did 2 decades ago in the US. These findings highlight the need for continuous validation and potential modification of established prognostic tools to improve their applicability across settings.. © 2025 American Medical Association.

Yajima S.; Hirose K.; Masuda H.,Enfortumab Vedotin with or Without Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2025,JAMA Network Open,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.0250,"Importance: Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) presents a therapeutic challenge with poor outcome. Enfortumab vedotin has emerged as a promising treatment, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness and safety. Objective: To synthesize the available evidence on enfortumab vedotin, both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, as an mUC treatment for the purpose of guiding clinical decision-making and future research. Data Sources: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Google Scholar, and Web of Science were searched from database inception to August 31, 2024. Major conference abstracts from 2019 to 2024 were also included. Search strategy used a combination of Medical Subject Heading terms and free-text keywords related to mUC and enfortumab vedotin. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials and prospective studies investigating enfortumab vedotin in adult patients with mUC were included. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool. The meta-analysis used a random effects model, while a network meta-analysis was performed using a frequentist approach. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR), and 1-year survival rate. Results: The 11 included studies (3 randomized clinical trials [27.3%] and 8 nonrandomized prospective studies [72.7%]) involved 2128 patients. Of these patients, 563 (26.5%) received enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab, 814 (38.3%) received enfortumab vedotin without pembrolizumab, and 751 (35.3%) received chemotherapy. Enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab was associated with a pooled DCR of 86% (95% CI, 83%-89%), ORR of 68% (95% CI, 64%-71%), and a 1-year survival rate of 79% (95% CI, 75%-82%). Enfortumab vedotin monotherapy had a pooled DCR of 73% (95% CI, 70%-76%), ORR of 43% (95% CI, 40%-47%), and a 1-year survival rate of 52% (95% CI, 48%-56%). Network meta-analysis revealed that enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab significantly outperformed chemotherapy in ORR (odds ratio [OR], 3.47; 95% CI, 1.49-8.09; P =.004) and 1-year survival (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.75-3.06; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab showed high response rates in first-line settings, while enfortumab vedotin monotherapy was associated with clinical benefit in later lines of therapy. These findings underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches, and future research is warranted to refine enfortumab vedotin-based therapies for mUC management.  © 2025 Yajima S et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000198004,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study presents the longest-term data to date on patisiran for hATTR-PN. Objective: To present the long-term efficacy and safety of patisiran in adults with hATTR-PN. Design, Setting, and Participants: This global open-label extension (OLE) of the APOLLO randomized clinical trial and phase 2 OLE study enrolled patients from 43 hospitals or clinical centers across 19 countries between July 2015 and August 2017, with follow-up until November 2022. Of 212 eligible patients with hATTR who completed the phase 3 APOLLO or phase 2 OLE parent studies, 211 enrolled in and 138 completed the global OLE. Intervention: Patisiran, 0.3 mg/kg, intravenously once every 3 weeks for up to 5 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes evaluated at year 5 of the global OLE included disability (polyneuropathy disability [PND] score); polyneuropathy severity (Neuropathy Impairment Score [NIS]), nutritional status (modified body mass index [mBMI]), quality of life (Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy [Norfolk QOL-DN]), and Rasch-Built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS), with no statistical hierarchy. Safety, survival probability, and mortality were also assessed. Results: At the global OLE baseline, the mean (SD) age was 61.3 (12.3) years, and 156 patients (73.9%) were male. In 138 patients completing the study, PND scores remained stable or improved in 89 patients (65.0%), NISs showed a mean (SD) change of 10.9 (14.7), and mean (SD) mBMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared times serum albumin in grams per liter) increased by 46.4 (120.7) over 5 years from baseline. Norfolk QOL-DN and R-ODS scores showed mean (SD) changes of 4.1 (16.7) and -3.7 (6.2), respectively. Adverse events (AEs) leading to study withdrawal occurred in 47 patients (22.3%). Infusion-related reactions were the most common treatment-related AE (n = 34 [16.1%]). Overall, 41 patients (19.4%) died during the study. Patisiran treatment in the parent study and low familial amyloid polyneuropathy score at parent study baseline were associated with significantly improved survival. Conclusions and Relevance: In the longest study of an RNAi therapeutic for any disease, patisiran treatment resulted in modest changes for patients with hATTR-PN with an acceptable safety profile. These results highlight the importance of initiating early treatment for hATTR and the potential of RNAi therapeutics in medicine.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the clinical utility of respiratory sarcopenia for optimizing postoperative risk stratification in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study reviewed consecutive patients undergoing lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection for NSCLC at 2 institutions in Tokyo, Japan, between 2009 and 2018. Eligible patients underwent electronic computed tomography image analysis. Follow-up began at the date of surgery and continued until death, the last contact, or March 2022. Data analysis was performed from April 2022 to March 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Respiratory sarcopenia was identified by poor respiratory strength (peak expiratory flow rate) and was confirmed by a low pectoralis muscle index (PMI; pectoralis muscle area/body mass index). Patients with poor peak expiratory flow rate but normal PMI received a diagnosis of pre-respiratory sarcopenia. Short-term and long-term postoperative outcomes were compared among patients with a normal status, pre-respiratory sarcopenia, and respiratory sarcopenia. Group differences were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Pearson χ2 test for continuous and categorical data, respectively. Survival differences were compared using the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS Of a total of 1016 patients, 806 (497 men [61.7%]; median [IQR] age, 69 [64-76] years) were eligible for electronic computed tomography image analysis. The median (IQR) duration of follow-up for survival was 5.2 (3.6-6.4) years. Respiratory strength was more closely correlated with PMI than pectoralis muscle radiodensity (Pearson r2, 0.58 vs 0.29). Respiratory strength and PMI declined with aging simultaneously (both P for trend < .001). Pre-respiratory sarcopenia was present in 177 patients (22.0%), and respiratory sarcopenia was present in 130 patients (16.1%). The risk of postoperative complications escalated from 82 patients (16.4%) with normal status to 39 patients (22.0%) with pre-respiratory sarcopenia to 39 patients (30.0%) with respiratory sarcopenia (P for trend < .001), as did the risk of delayed recovery after surgery (P for trend < .001). Compared with patients with normal status or pre-respiratory sarcopenia, patients with respiratory sarcopenia exhibited worse 5-year overall survival (438 patients [87.2%] vs 133 patients [72.9%] vs 85 patients [62.5%]; P for trend < .001). Multivariable analysis identified respiratory sarcopenia as a factor independently associated with increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.15-2.89; P = .01) after adjustment for sex, age, smoking status, performance status, chronic heart disease, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, C-reactive protein, albumin, carcinoembryonic antigen, histology, and pathologic stage. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study identified individuals at higher risk of poor outcomes by screening and staging respiratory sarcopenia. The early diagnosis of respiratory sarcopenia could optimize management strategies and facilitate longitudinal care in patients with NSCLC. © 2024 Sun C et al.

Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis of the multicenter Mass General Brigham health care system (Boston, Massachusetts) spanning 2018 to 2022, adults eligible for AOMs (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or BMI 27–29.9 kg/m2 with ≥1 ORC) were identified. Among those AOM-eligible, the prevalence of prescriptions for AOMs approved for long-term weight management was evaluated. Results: Of 2,469,474 adults (mean [SD], age 53 [19] years; 57% female; BMI 28.1 [6.3] kg/m2), a total of 1,110,251 (45.0%) were eligible for AOMs. Of these, 69.4% (31.2% of overall cohort) had BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. AOM prescription was observed in 15,214 (1.4%) of all eligible patients, with female sex, younger age, higher BMI, commercial insurance, and greater ORC burden associated with higher prevalence of AOM prescriptions. Musculoskeletal disorders (54%) were the most common ORCs, with ≥2 ORCs observed in 62% of patients. Liraglutide 3.0 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg were the most frequently prescribed AOMs (58% and 34% of all AOMs, respectively). Conclusions: Although nearly one-half of all patients in a large health care system were AOM-eligible by guidelines and regulatory labeling, only 1% of those who were eligible were prescribed AOMs. © 2024 The Author(s).

We investigated whether coexposure to BPA and its substitutes are associated with metabolic diseases (MDs), the related indicators, and their multimorbidity. Methods: The study included 1409 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Generalized linear regression, Bayesian kernel machine regression, and the weighted quantile sum (WQS) models were used to study the associations between bisphenol concentrations and comprehensive MDs, including their multimorbidity. Results: In the logistic regression model, BPA and bisphenol F were each independently associated with obesity, whereas BPA and bisphenol S (BPS) were each independently associated with multimorbidity. In the Bayesian kernel machine regression analysis, the joint effects of the three chemicals were positively associated with hypertension and obesity, with BPS generating the highest posterior inclusion probability. In the WQS regression analysis, the WQS index demonstrated significant associations with obesity and hypertension, with BPS the highest contributor to both of them. Conclusions: Three statistical methods confirmed that BPA and its substitutes were associated with specific MDs. Our findings indicate that coexposure to bisphenols significantly increases the risk of obesity and hypertension. © 2025 The Obesity Society.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010101035,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study aimed to investigate the PK of total and unbound concentrations of imatinib and the metabolite N-desmethyl imatinib in hospitalized patients with different severities of COVID-19, and to assess the impact of critical illness and the potential drug–drug interaction with IL-6R inhibitors on imatinib exposure. Imatinib, N-desmethyl imatinib, and AAG were quantified from collected plasma samples. The PK data was further combined with previous data from COVID-19 patients and chronic myelogenous leukemia/gastrointestinal stromal tumor (CML/GIST) patients who received imatinib. A population PK analysis was conducted using a standard sequential approach. Unbound fraction in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and treated with IL-6R inhibitors was significantly elevated compared to CML/GIST patients (4.66% vs. 3.54% [1.08%–8.51%]; p < 0.001), despite twofold increased AAG levels. Our findings on total and unbound concentration show that cotreatment with IL-6R inhibitor can lead to changes in metabolism and protein binding, suggesting similar implications for other highly protein bound drugs. Consequently, total concentrations may not accurately reflect unbound target site concentrations. © 2025 The Author(s).

This study aims to evaluate circulating chemokines, cytokines and leukocytes in the blood of patients with BC. Methods: A prospective study involving 200 women with infiltrative breast carcinoma was conducted. Patients were stratified by TNM stage and IHC subtype for survival analysis and correlations with the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and the expression of 13 chemokines and 3 cytokines. Results: Survival was significantly higher in women with early-stage tumors (I/II) and in Luminal A and HER2 + subtypes. No significant differences in NLR were observed across TNM stages or IH subtypes. Among the 172 non-metastatic patients, those with NLR > 2 had shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (multivariate analysis). In the Luminal B subgroup, patients with NLR > 2 exhibited worse progression-free survival (PFS) (multivariate analysis), while in the triple-negative (TN) subgroup NLR > 3 was associated with poorer overall survival (OS) (univariate analysis). NLR was prognostic during follow-up, with lower OS observed in patients with NLR > 3 at 12 months post-diagnosis. Significant correlations were identified among 8 CC/CXC chemokines. Furthermore, leukocyte count was significantly correlated with IL-6, RANTES/CCL5, and GRO-Alpha/CXCL1; lymphocytes with MCP1/CCL2; and monocytes with IP10/CXCL10. NLR was significantly correlated with RANTES/CCL5. Conclusion: Risk stratification in BC patients is grounded in tumor staging and immunohistochemistry. However, systemic inflammatory responses, including cytokine- and chemokine-mediated signaling of neutrophils and lymphocytes, play a critical role in modulating prognosis. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007668139,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Hardy T.; Liang S.; Tedeschi P.; Lin E.; Brinton E.A.; Davidson M.H.,Impact of Batoclimab Treatment on LDL-C with and Without Coadministration of Atorvastatin: Results from a Phase I Randomized Study in Healthy Participants,2025,Drug Safety,10.1007/s40264-025-01549-2,"Introduction: Batoclimab is an anti-neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor monoclonal antibody in clinical development for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In phase II trials, batoclimab resulted in dose-dependent reductions in pathogenic immunoglobulin G autoantibodies; however, dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other lipids were observed. Objective: This study examined the relationship between batoclimab treatment and lipid levels, and whether increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol could be mitigated by coadministration with atorvastatin, a widely used cholesterol-lowering agent. Methods: In this phase I, randomized, fixed-sequence, single-blind trial, 70 healthy participants received subcutaneous injections of batoclimab at various doses or placebo for 6 weeks. Open-label oral atorvastatin was coadministered in a subset of participants receiving batoclimab 340 mg or 680 mg weekly, starting 14 days before the first dose of the study drug, and continuing through the 6-week treatment period and 8-week safety follow-up. Key endpoints included changes in lipid parameters and atorvastatin pharmacokinetics. Results: Dose-dependent increases in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed with batoclimab doses ≥ 255 mg weekly, comparable to previous observations, whereas coadministration of atorvastatin 10 mg or 40 mg daily mitigated these changes. Batoclimab had little effect on atorvastatin pharmacokinetics. Dose-dependent decreases in serum albumin up to 37% were observed with batoclimab doses ≥ 255 mg weekly, returning to near-baseline levels 4 weeks after stopping batoclimab. As expected, coadministration of atorvastatin did not meaningfully impact the albumin level. The majority of adverse events were mild in severity. Conclusions: Atorvastatin can mitigate clinically significant increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that may occur with batoclimab treatment. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003566691,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Gomez N.A.; Blumel D.; Dueñas D.; Young B.; Hazel M.; Yu M.,Influence of experimental conditions on the adsorption of disease biomarker proteins to InP/ZnS quantum dots,2025,Analytical Biochemistry,10.1016/j.ab.2025.115903,"The spontaneous formation of quantum dot (QD)-protein assemblies in the physiological environment exhibits challenges or benefits for nanomedicine applications. In this study, we investigated the QD-protein assemblies spontaneously formed with the greener water soluble InP/ZnS–COOH QDs and isolated disease biomarker proteins under various environmental conditions, including QDs size, solution pH, incubation time, ionic strength, different salts, as well as the lowest concentrations of the proteins that started the formation of detectable assemblies. It was shown that higher ionic strength or valence charge disrupted the assembly's formation. The basic pH 8.5 facilitated the formation to a greater extent than the pH 7.4 did. The heat shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90α) adsorbed on QDs surface more readily than cytochrome C (CytoC) and lysozyme (Lyz) in the basic environment. Among the three-sized QDs compared, the medium-sized QDs were the most effective in promoting the assemblies' formation. The detectable assemblies started at as low as 0.4 ng/mL of CytoC, 1.0 ng/mL of HSP90α, or 1.8 ng/mL of Lyz, respectively. The findings add insights into how the biomarker proteins interacted with the QDs under different environmental conditions, which promotes the understanding of QD-protein assemblies' collaborative behaviors when they facilitate bioimaging and biomedicine applications. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005070167,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Current standard approaches for the detection of NPY hypermethylation levels rely on the use of enzymes and are associated with high costs, long times of analysis and interferences from PCR inhibitors, which limits their applicability in point-of-care or low-resource environments. Therefore, the need for an affordable, rapid, and sensitive technology for NPY methylation detection is clear. Results: Herein we present a novel, rapid, sensitive, highly selective, and enzyme-free photoelectrochemical ratiometric bio-platform for the detection and quantification of NPY gene hypermethylation. At the core of this method lies the use of magnetic microbeads and singlet oxygen (1O2)-based photoelectrochemical detection. The use of bisulfite conversion and hybridization temperature allowed to achieve a 99 % discrimination efficiency of the methylated NPY target from the unmethylated one. Detection of 18 pM (18 fmol) of 94-nucleotide methylated NPY target sequence with 6 methylation sites in hybridization buffer and 45 pM (45 fmol) against the background of genomic DNA was achieved without any amplification. Ultimately, ratiometric quantitative sensing of methylated NPY gene over reference albumin gene was carried out and an LOD of 2 % methylation level was obtained. Significance: Overall, this technique demonstrated immense potential in overcoming the complexity, high costs, and need for enzymes of current strategies for hypermethylation detection and thus represents a great innovation in (photo)electrochemical sensing of aberrant DNA methylation. It, therefore, holds great promise for establishing in future a clinically relevant point-of-care testing device. © 2025",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009619708,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study aimed to characterize the relationships of RBCM profiles and anemia types to HF outcomes and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) parameters. Methods: Chronic stable HF patients were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent BVA; a subset underwent supine invasive CPET within 24 hours of BVA. RBCM profiles were defined using RBCM %deviation (deficit: <−10%, normal: −10 to 10%, excess: >10%). Anemia defined by World Health Organization criteria alone was categorized using RBCM %deviation (<−10% true anemia, ≥−10% dilutional pseudo-anemia). HF hospitalization at 6 months and CPET parameters were compared among RBCM profiles and anemia types. Results: One-hundred twenty patients (58 years, 40% female, 41% Black, 63% HFrEF) were enrolled. Forty percent had RBCM deficit, 37.5% had normal RBCM, and 22.5% had excess RBCM. Fifty-eight patients (48%) were anemic: 60% true anemia and 40% dilutional pseudo-anemia. Patients with dilutional pseudo-anemia had a higher incidence of HF hospitalization (44.8%) compared to no anemia (22.7%) and true anemia (20.6%) (P = .040). There was no difference in HF hospitalization among RBCM profiles (P = .99). There was a nonsignificant trend toward worse peak VO2 in RBCM deficit and true anemia, with no differences in other CPET parameters. Conclusions: Dilutional pseudo-anemia demonstrated higher HF hospitalizations compared to true anemia, while true anemia had a trend towards worse peak VO2. The implications of BVA-identified RBCM profiles and anemia types for clinical management warrant further investigation. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005009836,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

STAREE-HEART is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing atorvastatin on markers of cardiovascular aging in a healthy older population. This ancillary study is nested in the STAtins in Reducing Events in the Elderly (STAREE) primary prevention trial. Methods: Participants ≥ 70 years (n = 369) have been randomized to atorvastatin or placebo. Assessment at baseline and 3-years includes echocardiogram, electrocardiography and blood collection for biomarker assessment. The primary endpoint is change in global longitudinal strain (GLS), a measure of left ventricular systolic function. An estimated 184 participants per group enables detection of mean GLS at 3 years in the placebo group being 2.0 percentage points lower than mean GLS in the statin group at 3 years, assuming SD = 5 percentage points and a 15% attrition rate, with power >90%. We present summary statistics describing participants at baseline. Results: The mean age of the 369 STAREE-HEART participants was 73.0 years (SD 3.4). Mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was 64.0% (SD 6.1), and mean GLS was 19.2% (SD 2.2). Mean GLS was similar between females and males (19.4% vs 19.0%) and slightly higher in those aged 70 to 74 compared to ≥75 years (19.4% vs 18.6%). AF was detected on screening in 4.5% of participants. Conclusion: The STAREE-HEART ancillary study will provide mechanistic detail concerning myocardial dysfunction and its consequences, to determine if atorvastatin affects left ventricular systolic function associated with aging.

Methods: A total of 705 legs with chronic edema, defined as persistent leg edema lasting for > 3 months, were examined in 411 patients who visited our clinic between April 2009 and March 2024. Patients with known systemic edematous conditions or those with serum albumin levels <3.5 g/dL and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, as confirmed during screening blood tests at their initial visits, were excluded from the study. The presence of edema in the leg, including the pedal region, was confirmed using ultrasonography to detect subcutaneous echo-free spaces (SEFS). Routine assessments included blood screening, duplex venous scans, and skin ultrasonography. Air plethysmography, lymphangioscintigraphy, and bioelectrical impedance analysis were performed whenever feasible. Results: The prevalence of PE in legs with chronic edema was 64%. Multivariate analyses identified the severity of SEFS in the lateral lower calf, which correlated with the overall severity of leg edema (odds ratio [OR]: 5.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.46–14.62; P < 0.001), and serum albumin level (OR: 2.55; 95% CI: 1.31–5.05; P < 0.01) as significant risk factors for PE. Conclusion: PE was present in 64% of legs with chronic edema. The primary contributors to PE were the overall severity of leg edema and lower serum albumin levels, even within the normal range. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004295980,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study evaluates the prognostic value of the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI) as a biomarker for predicting restenosis risk in SFA lesions. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, 632 patients undergoing endovascular interventions for symptomatic PAD were analyzed. AISI was calculated as: (neutrophils × platelets × monocytes)/lymphocytes. Patients were divided into 2 groups as those who developed restenosis and those who did not develop restenosis. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent predictors of restenosis. Results: Among 632 patients, 142 developed restenosis. The median AISI was significantly higher in the restenosis group compared to the nonrestenosis group (909.28 vs. 516.59, P < 0.001). Patients with high AISI demonstrated a 2.13-fold increased risk of restenosis (hazard ratio: 2.133, 95% confidence interval: 1.508–3.017, P < 0.001) and a shorter time to restenosis (median: 6 months vs. 12 months). Smoking, presence of prior intervention, intervention types, and stent-graft use were also associated with an elevated risk of restenosis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified an AISI cutoff value of 489.64 (sensitivity: 57%, specificity: 56%, area under the curve: 0.623). Conclusion: AISI is a promising inflammatory biomarker for predicting the risk of restenosis in PAD patients undergoing endovascular treatment of the SFA. Incorporating AISI into clinical practice could enhance risk stratification and guide personalized management strategies. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and further investigate the mechanistic role of systemic inflammation in restenosis development. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010576472,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Bile salts and bilirubin are often implicated in the etiology of pruritus. We evaluated whether these compounds activate known itch receptors. Methods: Activation of the established pruriceptors TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPV3, TRPV4, MRGPRX4 in cells overexpressing these receptors, by monitoring cytosolic free Ca2+. TGR5 activation was assayed by means of cAMP ELISA in TGR5 overexpressing cells. Serum from 43 cholestatic patients and 15 controls was analyzed for receptor activation; plasma bile salt concentrations were quantified by HPLC-MS. Results: Plasma levels of conjugated bile salts and their sulphated and glucuronidated derivatives correlated with pruritus intensity; most unconjugated bile salts did not. TRPA1 and MRGPRX4 were activated by bile salts only at high concentrations. Bilirubin only weakly activated MRGPRX4. However, physiological levels of albumin completely abrogated these activations. Incubation of receptor-expressing cells with patient serum (containing albumin) did not activate any of the itch receptors. In contrast, physiological concentrations of albumin reduced but did not completely abrogate bile salt-induced TGR5 activation, and the extent of this activation correlated with pruritus intensity. However, TGR5 activation was also induced by plasma from NTCP-deficient individuals. Conclusion: While TGR5 activation correlates with pruritus, this receptor was also activated by plasma of NTCP deficient patients who do not suffer from pruritus, indicating that activation of TGR5 is not a dominant factor. The absence of receptor activation in the presence of physiological concentrations of albumin indicates that bile salts and bilirubin do not play a direct role in activation of these receptors. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012941314,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Key regulators of this response in macrophages are the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. This study explored the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin C and AptaminC320 in macrophages. We found that nitric oxide, produced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), was reduced by vitamin C and AptaminC320 in RAW264.7 cells, which are murine macrophages. Furthermore, these substances reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. We also demonstrated that protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), increased by LPS in macrophages, as well as the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38, were reduced by vitamin C and AptaminC320. These findings suggest that vitamin C and AptaminC320 exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by modulating NF-κB and MAPK signaling, suggesting that they offer significant therapeutic potential as safe and effective treatments for inflammatory diseases with minimal side effects in comparison with the commonly used steroidal anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217979335,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

There is growing interest in investigating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), cognition, and other mental health-related disorders. This has created a need for a comprehensive, combined, and easy-to-follow method to isolate serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and hippocampal neurons. The hippocampus, responsible for learning and memory, is affected by various neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, obtaining samples like CSF and hippocampal neurons is challenging, especially from small animals like rats. Currently, there is no efficient method for isolating these samples altogether from a single animal, and its use in downstream applications has not been thoroughly tested. We have developed a comprehensive and streamlined method for isolating serum, CSF, and hippocampal neurons from a single animal, suitable for downstream applications such as proteomics and biomarker research. This method involves using high-speed centrifugation instruments and density gradient centrifugation, which are easy to follow. The isolated proteins were identified through mass spectrometry. Our method has been successfully tested for high-throughput applications with small sample volumes, demonstrating its clinical utility. With our simplified approach, proteins in serum, CSF, and neural cells can be studied simultaneously. The method achieves ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and reproducibility, thereby facilitating a better understanding of neurological disorders. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008709511,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Two therapeutic strategies were designed. One utilizes calcium silicate (CS) hydrogel for localized intramuscular treatment, and the other employs CS solution for systemic treatment through Intravenous injection. Both treatments restore silicon levels in the muscles and serum of aging mice, and show therapeutic effects on sarcopenia. Specifically, the CS hydrogel demonstrates more pronounced short-term efficacy in promoting local muscle regeneration, while the CS solution exhibits superior outcomes in modulating the overall condition of aging mice. The fundamental mechanism of the CS treatments on sarcopenia may involve the direct regulation of the SIRTs signaling pathway by silicate ions released from CS, as well as the indirect regulation of SIRTs pathway via the suppression of Sarcolipin (SLN) overexpression by silicate ions. Specifically, silicate ions directly upregulate SIRT1 expression in macrophages and on one side promote NF-kB deacetylation to inhibit M1 polarization, and on the other side facilitate STAT3 deacetylation to inhibit M2 polarization, ultimately reducing the expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6) and fibrotic factors (IL-10, TGF-β). Meanwhile, silicate ions directly upregulate SIRT3 in myoblasts, leading to the promotion of STAT3 dephosphorylation, inhibits mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) secretion, and enhances the expression of MyoD, MyoG, and Myosin, and accelerates myogenic differentiation. This bioactive CS based therapy provides a new approach for combating sarcopenia. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009118085,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Despite extensive research for more than 50 years, physical mechanisms that govern RBC aggregation are still under debate. Two proposed mechanisms are based on bridging and depletion interactions between RBCs due to the presence of macromolecules in blood plasma. The bridging hypothesis assumes the formation of bonds between RBCs through adsorbing macromolecules, while the depletion mechanism results from the exclusion of macromolecules from the intercellular space, leading to effective attraction. Existing experimental studies generally cannot differentiate between these two aggregation mechanisms, although several recent investigations suggest concurrent involvement of the both mechanisms. We explore dynamic aggregation and disaggregation of two RBCs using three simulation models: a potential-based model mimicking depletion interactions, a bridging model with immobile bonds, and a new bridging model with mobile bonds that can slide along RBC membranes. Simulation results indicate that dynamic aggregation of RBCs primarily arises from depletion interactions, while disaggregation of RBCs involves both mechanisms. The bridging model with mobile bonds reproduces well the corresponding experimental data, offering insights into the interplay between bridging and depletion interactions and providing a framework for studying similar interactions between other biological cells. © 2025 Biophysical Society",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002268137,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In this study, bioglass and bioceramics composed of CaO, SiO2, P2O5, and Na2O were synthesized via the sol-gel method and characterized to assess their structural, chemical, and thermal properties. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed their amorphous nature, while Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy identified key functional groups (Si–O–Si, P–O) crucial for bioactivity. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) determined the degradation temperature up to 700 °C. The synthesized materials were employed as drug delivery matrices for ciprofloxacin (CIP), amoxicillin, and levofloxacin. Levofloxacin exhibited the highest drug-loading capacity (0.75 %), while drug release studies in simulated body fluid (SBF) indicated sustained release, with ciprofloxacin achieving 30 % release and levofloxacin 70 %. Bioceramics exhibited lower drug-loading efficiency compared to bioglass, demonstrating reduced effectiveness as a biomaterial. Among powdered samples, amoxicillin showed 10 % incorporation, with bioglass facilitating the highest release. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Gram-positive (S. aureus, B. cereus, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative (E. coli, S. abony), and fungal (C. albicans) strains. Ciprofloxacin-loaded bioglass exhibited superior efficacy, with a maximum inhibition zone of 33.5 ± 1.32 mm against S. abony, highlighting its potential for antibacterial applications.

Cardiac accumulation leads to left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis, and sudden cardiac death. Advances in transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) have enabled the detection of subclinical atrial and ventricular cardiomyopathy. Until now, studies assessing changes on TTE in FD have been small and cross-sectional. To understand longitudinal changes, our aim was to quantify trends in TTE parameters, linked to relevant physiological and biochemical parameters. Methods: A single-centre retrospective study was conducted of 75 FD patients who received longitudinal follow-up care (53% female, 57% on enzyme replacement therapy) between 2011 and 2023. Results: Longitudinal follow-up care demonstrated increasingly impaired left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), tissue Doppler imaging, and right ventricular systolic function. Atrial changes included increasingly impaired left atrial GLS, greater volumes, and reduced left atrial ejection fraction and fractional area change. A sex-specific increase occurred in indexed left ventricular mass in male patients. Biochemical changes included increases in high-sensitivity Troponin-T and N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. A sex-specific increase in the urine protein level and the albumin-creatinine ratio in male patients. Conclusions: TTE and biochemical trends highlight the gradual and insidious nature of FD progression, and stress the importance of considering multiparametric endpoints, including GLS, atrial function, and biomarkers, when assessing outcome in FD. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219080394,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: Data from 480 trough tacrolimus concentrations in 86 cSLE patients over five years were analyzed. A nonlinear mixed-effects model was constructed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus. We screened 27 machine learning and deep learning models using 29 clinical variables to select the best-performing individualized dose prediction model. To further enhance prediction accuracy, the pharmacokinetic parameters were subsequently embedded within the optimized model. Model performance was assessed through the utilization of goodness-of-fit plots and diagnostic parameters such as objective function values and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Results: The pharmacokinetic profile of tacrolimus was best accurately characterized by a one-compartment model, which incorporated first-order kinetics for both absorption and elimination processes. The typical estimates for apparent clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) were 3.52 L/h/70 kg and 124.84 L/70 kg, respectively. Among the 27 machine learning models, the XGBoost algorithm demonstrated the best prediction accuracy for tacrolimus dose (R2 = 0.74, mean absolute error [MAE] = 0.016, mean square error [MSE] = 0.0005). After incorporating 11 key variables, including pharmacokinetic parameters (CL/F and V/F), into the model and performing hyperparameter turning, prediction accuracy significantly enhanced (R2 = 0.80, MAE = 0.013, MSE = 0.0004). Two cSLE patients who received model-predicted doses achieved disease activity indexes ≤4 after treatment. Conclusion: This study successfully developed an accurate machine learning-based model for predicting individualized tacrolimus dosing in cSLE patients. The integration of pharmacokinetic parameters significantly enhanced the model's accuracy, improving dosing precision and reducing overexposure, thus enhancing therapeutic efficacy. © 2025",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010921975,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
