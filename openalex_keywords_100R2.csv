Developed in the US in 2001, its accuracy in contemporary non-US contexts is unclear. Objective: To evaluate the external validity of the Walter Index in predicting posthospitalization mortality risk in Brazilian older adult inpatients. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study used data from a cohort of adults aged 70 years or older admitted to the geriatric unit of a university hospital in Brazil from January 1, 2009, to February 28, 2020. Participants underwent comprehensive geriatric assessments at admission, were reevaluated at discharge, and were subsequently followed up for 48 months. Data were analyzed from March to July 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures: The Walter Index, a score based on 6 risk factors (male sex, dependent activities of daily living at discharge, heart failure, cancer, high creatinine level, and low albumin level), was calculated to assess its predictive accuracy for 12-month mortality as well as 6-, 24-, and 48-month mortality. The study investigated whether incorporating delirium, frailty, or C-reactive protein level enhanced accuracy. Performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility measures. Results: In total, 2780 participants (mean [SD] age, 81 [7] years; 1795 [65%] female) were included, with 89 (3%) lost to follow-up. The 12-month posthospitalization mortality rate was 23% (646 participants). Mortality was 7% (47 of 634) in the lowest-risk group (0-1 point), 17% (111 of 668) for 2 to 3 points, 25% (198 of 803) for 4 to 6 points, and 43% (290 of 675) in the highest-risk group (≥7 points). The index demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.714 (95% CI, 0.691-0.736) for predicting 12-month posthospitalization mortality (AUCs were 0.75 and 0.80 in the original derivation and validation cohorts, respectively). Comparable results were observed for mortality at 6 months (AUC, 0.726; 95% CI, 0.700-0.752), 24 months (AUC, 0.711; 95% CI, 0.691-0.730), and 48 months (AUC, 0.719; 95% CI, 0.700-0.738). Adding delirium modestly increased the index's discrimination (AUC, 0.723; 95% CI, 0.702-0.749); additionally including frailty and C-reactive protein level did not improve discrimination further (AUC, 0.723; 95% CI, 0.701-0.744). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prognostic study of hospitalized older adults in Brazil, the Walter Index showed similar discrimination in predicting postdischarge mortality as it did 2 decades ago in the US. These findings highlight the need for continuous validation and potential modification of established prognostic tools to improve their applicability across settings.. © 2025 American Medical Association.

Objective: To investigate the effect of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tumor pathogenic variants (tPVs) by comparing 2 deescalated neoadjuvant regimens (nab-paclitaxel plus either carboplatin or gemcitabine) on pathologic complete response (pCR), invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and overall survival (OS) of patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a preplanned secondary analysis of a phase 2 prospective randomized clinical trial (ADAPT-TN) conducted by the West German Study Group (WSG) at 45 sites in Germany between June 2013 and February 2015. The trial enrolled patients with noninflammatory early-stage TNBC (clinical tumor size ≥1 cm; estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression <1%; and ERBB2 negative). DNA samples from pretreatment biopsies were obtained. Genetic analysis was performed between January 2018 and March 2020. Final data analyses took place in September 2023. Exposure: Patients were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with nab-paclitaxel plus either carboplatin or gemcitabine; omission of otherwise mandatory anthracycline-containing chemotherapy was allowed in the case of pCR. tPVs in 20 cancer-associated genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, were analyzed using a customized gene panel. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tPVs and their effect on pCR rate, IDFS, and OS were evaluated using logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Of the 307 patients with DNA samples from pretreatment biopsies available, tumor next-generation sequencing analyses were successful for 266 patients. The 266 patients included in this analysis were female, with a median age of 51 years (range, 26-76 years). A total of 162 patients (60.9%) had a clinical tumor size of 2 cm or greater, and 70 (26.3%) had clinical node-positive disease. BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tPVs were detected in 42 patients (15.8%). The highest pCR rate among patients with BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tPVs was seen in the nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin group (9 of 14 patients [64.3%]) compared with the nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group (10 of 28 [35.7%]) (odds ratio, 3.24 [95% CI, 0.85-12.36]; P =.08); the highest numeric 5-year IDFS and OS rates (84.4% and 92.9%, respectively) were seen in the nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin group. Conclusions and Relevance: In this secondary analysis of the WSG-ADAPT-TN randomized clinical trial on tPVs, deescalated nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin was superior to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, particularly in patients with BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tPVs. These findings suggest that BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tPV status could be a candidate marker for a deescalation strategy in early-stage TNBC; however, prospective validation of survival outcomes in larger cohorts with differentiation between germline and somatic pathogenic variants is necessary.

Yajima S.; Hirose K.; Masuda H.,Enfortumab Vedotin with or Without Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2025,JAMA Network Open,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.0250,"Importance: Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) presents a therapeutic challenge with poor outcome. Enfortumab vedotin has emerged as a promising treatment, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness and safety. Objective: To synthesize the available evidence on enfortumab vedotin, both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, as an mUC treatment for the purpose of guiding clinical decision-making and future research. Data Sources: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Google Scholar, and Web of Science were searched from database inception to August 31, 2024. Major conference abstracts from 2019 to 2024 were also included. Search strategy used a combination of Medical Subject Heading terms and free-text keywords related to mUC and enfortumab vedotin. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials and prospective studies investigating enfortumab vedotin in adult patients with mUC were included. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool. The meta-analysis used a random effects model, while a network meta-analysis was performed using a frequentist approach. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR), and 1-year survival rate. Results: The 11 included studies (3 randomized clinical trials [27.3%] and 8 nonrandomized prospective studies [72.7%]) involved 2128 patients. Of these patients, 563 (26.5%) received enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab, 814 (38.3%) received enfortumab vedotin without pembrolizumab, and 751 (35.3%) received chemotherapy. Enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab was associated with a pooled DCR of 86% (95% CI, 83%-89%), ORR of 68% (95% CI, 64%-71%), and a 1-year survival rate of 79% (95% CI, 75%-82%). Enfortumab vedotin monotherapy had a pooled DCR of 73% (95% CI, 70%-76%), ORR of 43% (95% CI, 40%-47%), and a 1-year survival rate of 52% (95% CI, 48%-56%). Network meta-analysis revealed that enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab significantly outperformed chemotherapy in ORR (odds ratio [OR], 3.47; 95% CI, 1.49-8.09; P =.004) and 1-year survival (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.75-3.06; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab showed high response rates in first-line settings, while enfortumab vedotin monotherapy was associated with clinical benefit in later lines of therapy. These findings underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches, and future research is warranted to refine enfortumab vedotin-based therapies for mUC management.  © 2025 Yajima S et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000198004,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The role of APOE in AD varies with sex and ancestry. While the association of APOE with AD biomarkers also varies across sex and ancestry, no study has systematically investigated both sex-specific and ancestry differences of APOE on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers together, resulting in limited insights and generalizability. Objective: To systematically investigate the association of sex and APOE-ϵ4 with 3 core CSF biomarkers across ancestries. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study examined 3 CSF biomarkers (amyloid β1-42 [Aβ42], phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau], and total tau, in participants from 20 cohorts from July 1, 1985, to March 31, 2020. These individuals were grouped into African, Asian, and European ancestries based on genetic data. Data analyses were conducted from June 1, 2023, to November 10, 2024. Exposure: Sex (male or female) and APOE-ϵ4. Main Outcomes and Measures: The associations of sex and APOE-ϵ4 with biomarker levels were assessed within each ancestry group, adjusting for age. Meta-analyses were performed to identify these associations across ancestries. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to exclude the potential influence of the APOE-ϵ2 allele. Results: This cohort study included 4592 individuals (mean [SD] age, 70.8 [10.2] years; 2425 [52.8%] female; 119 [2.6%] African, 52 [1.1%] Asian, and 4421 [96.3%] European). Higher APOE-ϵ4 dosage scores were associated with lower Aβ42 values (β [SE], -0.58 [0.02], P <.001), indicating more severe pathology; these associations were seen in men and women separately and jointly. The association with APOE-ϵ4 was statistically greater in men (β [SE], -0.63 [0.03]; P <.001) vs women (β [SE], -0.52 [0.03]; P <.001) of European ancestry (P =.01 for interaction). Women had higher levels of p-tau, indicating more severe neurofibrillary pathology. The association between APOE-ϵ4 dosage and p-tau was in the expected direction (higher APOE-ϵ4 dosage for higher p-tau values) in both sexes, but the difference between sexes was significant only in those of African ancestry (β [SE], 0.10 [0.18]; P =.57 for men; β [SE], 0.66 [0.17]; P <.001 for women; P =.03 for interaction). Women also had higher levels of total tau, indicating more neuronal damage. The association between APOE-ϵ4 dosage and total tau was stronger in women than in men in the African cohort (β [SE], 0.20 [0.22]; P =.36 for men and β [SE], 0.65 [0.22], P =.004 for women [P =.16 for interaction]) and European cohort (β [SE], 0.36 [0.03]; P <.001 in women and β [SE], 0.27 [0.03], P <.001 in men [P =.053 for interaction]); no significant associations were found in the Asian cohort. Sensitivity analysis excluding APOE-ϵ2 carriers yielded similar results. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, the association of the APOE-ϵ4 risk allele with tau accumulation was higher in women than in men. These findings underscore the importance of considering sex differences in APOE-ϵ4's association with AD biomarkers and tau pathology mechanisms in AD. Although this study provides robust evidence of complex interplay between sex and APOE-ϵ4 for European ancestry, further research is needed to fully understand other ancestry differences.  © 2025 Xu X et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000201515,Apolipoprotein E

This study presents the longest-term data to date on patisiran for hATTR-PN. Objective: To present the long-term efficacy and safety of patisiran in adults with hATTR-PN. Design, Setting, and Participants: This global open-label extension (OLE) of the APOLLO randomized clinical trial and phase 2 OLE study enrolled patients from 43 hospitals or clinical centers across 19 countries between July 2015 and August 2017, with follow-up until November 2022. Of 212 eligible patients with hATTR who completed the phase 3 APOLLO or phase 2 OLE parent studies, 211 enrolled in and 138 completed the global OLE. Intervention: Patisiran, 0.3 mg/kg, intravenously once every 3 weeks for up to 5 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes evaluated at year 5 of the global OLE included disability (polyneuropathy disability [PND] score); polyneuropathy severity (Neuropathy Impairment Score [NIS]), nutritional status (modified body mass index [mBMI]), quality of life (Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy [Norfolk QOL-DN]), and Rasch-Built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS), with no statistical hierarchy. Safety, survival probability, and mortality were also assessed. Results: At the global OLE baseline, the mean (SD) age was 61.3 (12.3) years, and 156 patients (73.9%) were male. In 138 patients completing the study, PND scores remained stable or improved in 89 patients (65.0%), NISs showed a mean (SD) change of 10.9 (14.7), and mean (SD) mBMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared times serum albumin in grams per liter) increased by 46.4 (120.7) over 5 years from baseline. Norfolk QOL-DN and R-ODS scores showed mean (SD) changes of 4.1 (16.7) and -3.7 (6.2), respectively. Adverse events (AEs) leading to study withdrawal occurred in 47 patients (22.3%). Infusion-related reactions were the most common treatment-related AE (n = 34 [16.1%]). Overall, 41 patients (19.4%) died during the study. Patisiran treatment in the parent study and low familial amyloid polyneuropathy score at parent study baseline were associated with significantly improved survival. Conclusions and Relevance: In the longest study of an RNAi therapeutic for any disease, patisiran treatment resulted in modest changes for patients with hATTR-PN with an acceptable safety profile. These results highlight the importance of initiating early treatment for hATTR and the potential of RNAi therapeutics in medicine.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the clinical utility of respiratory sarcopenia for optimizing postoperative risk stratification in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study reviewed consecutive patients undergoing lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection for NSCLC at 2 institutions in Tokyo, Japan, between 2009 and 2018. Eligible patients underwent electronic computed tomography image analysis. Follow-up began at the date of surgery and continued until death, the last contact, or March 2022. Data analysis was performed from April 2022 to March 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Respiratory sarcopenia was identified by poor respiratory strength (peak expiratory flow rate) and was confirmed by a low pectoralis muscle index (PMI; pectoralis muscle area/body mass index). Patients with poor peak expiratory flow rate but normal PMI received a diagnosis of pre-respiratory sarcopenia. Short-term and long-term postoperative outcomes were compared among patients with a normal status, pre-respiratory sarcopenia, and respiratory sarcopenia. Group differences were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Pearson χ2 test for continuous and categorical data, respectively. Survival differences were compared using the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS Of a total of 1016 patients, 806 (497 men [61.7%]; median [IQR] age, 69 [64-76] years) were eligible for electronic computed tomography image analysis. The median (IQR) duration of follow-up for survival was 5.2 (3.6-6.4) years. Respiratory strength was more closely correlated with PMI than pectoralis muscle radiodensity (Pearson r2, 0.58 vs 0.29). Respiratory strength and PMI declined with aging simultaneously (both P for trend < .001). Pre-respiratory sarcopenia was present in 177 patients (22.0%), and respiratory sarcopenia was present in 130 patients (16.1%). The risk of postoperative complications escalated from 82 patients (16.4%) with normal status to 39 patients (22.0%) with pre-respiratory sarcopenia to 39 patients (30.0%) with respiratory sarcopenia (P for trend < .001), as did the risk of delayed recovery after surgery (P for trend < .001). Compared with patients with normal status or pre-respiratory sarcopenia, patients with respiratory sarcopenia exhibited worse 5-year overall survival (438 patients [87.2%] vs 133 patients [72.9%] vs 85 patients [62.5%]; P for trend < .001). Multivariable analysis identified respiratory sarcopenia as a factor independently associated with increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.15-2.89; P = .01) after adjustment for sex, age, smoking status, performance status, chronic heart disease, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, C-reactive protein, albumin, carcinoembryonic antigen, histology, and pathologic stage. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study identified individuals at higher risk of poor outcomes by screening and staging respiratory sarcopenia. The early diagnosis of respiratory sarcopenia could optimize management strategies and facilitate longitudinal care in patients with NSCLC. © 2024 Sun C et al.

This study aims to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a single and a second IVIg dose (SID) in patients with GBS. Methods: Data were analyzed from the SID-GBS trial, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients with poor prognosis (modified Erasmus GBS Outcome Score, mEGOS ≥6) after a standard course of IVIg (0.4 g/kg for 5 days) were randomized to receive either SID or placebo. Serum IgG levels were measured at standard serial time points and clinical outcomes were assessed using the GBS disability score and Medical Research Council sum score. PK modeling was performed to predict IVIg exposure and its association with clinical outcomes. Results: Serum IgG concentration after a single and double course of IVIg was variable, but accurately described by the current PK model. Lower ΔIgG and IVIg exposure were associated with poorer clinical outcomes. SID increased the IgG concentration, but did not result in an improvement in clinical outcome. Serious adverse events, including thromboembolic events, occurred more frequently in the SID group and were associated with lower IVIg exposure. Interpretation: SID increases serum IgG levels in GBS patients as predicted by the current PK model, but does not improve clinical outcomes and increases the risk of serious adverse events. Model-informed precision dosing may guide individualization of treatment. © 2025 The Author(s).

However, the potential of CSF flow cytometry applied on a large scale remains unknown. Methods: We used data-driven approaches to analyze paired CSF and blood flow cytometry measurements from 8,790 patients (discovery cohort) and CSF only data from 3,201 patients (validation cohort) collected across neurological diseases in a real-world setting. Results: In somatoform controls (n = 788), activation of T cells increased with age in both CSF and blood, whereas double negative blood T cells (CD3+CD4−CD8−) decreased with age. A machine learning model of CSF and blood immune cells defined immune age, which correlated strongly with true biological age (r = 0.71). Classifying all diseases solely based on the CSF/blood parameters in 8,790 patients resulted in clusters of 4 disease categories: healthy, autoimmune, meningoencephalitis, and neurodegenerative. This clustering was validated in an analytically independent test dataset (8,790 patients) and in a temporally independent cohort (3,201 patients). Patients with multiple sclerosis were more likely to have progressive disease when assigned to the neurodegeneration cluster and to have lower disability in the autoimmune cluster. Patients with dementia in the neurodegeneration cluster showed more severe disease progression. Flow cytometry helped differentiate dementia from controls, thereby enhancing the diagnostic power of routine CSF diagnostics. Interpretation: Flow cytometry of CSF and blood thus identifies site-specific aging patterns and disease-overarching patterns of neurodegeneration. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:779–790. © 2024 The Author(s).

This complex exhibits a unique capability to catalyze a Fenton-like reaction within the tumor microenvironment (TME), which is characterized by overexpressed hydrogen peroxide. The Cu(II) complex Cu8 exploits this condition to generate highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals. These radicals are extremely effective in inducing programmed cell death or apoptosis in HeLa cells, a type of cervical cancer cell, and additionally cause significant damage to the mitochondria (the powerhouses of the cell). Due to these properties, the complex functions as a potent chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent, demonstrating promising antitumor potential. The precise coordination of the [Ph2PO2]− ligand within the complex is critical to its effectiveness in catalyzing the Fenton-like reaction, thereby enabling its therapeutic application in chemodynamic therapy. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011684959,HeLa; Hydroxyl radical

This study presents an injectable system based on a photocrosslinkable hydrogel, functionalized with a drug release system to deliver bioactive doses of the biomineralizing drug simvastatin. Chitosan microspheres (MSCH) loaded with 2%, 5%, or 10% simvastatin (MSCHSV) were prepared and incorporated into gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) to create a hybrid hydrogel activated by LED light. Characterizations, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pore size, porosity, and swelling capacity, confirmed the inclusion of particles and creation of a 3D biomaterial. The inclusion of microspheres did not alter the hydrogel's degradability under enzymatic action. Biostimulation of human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) on the hydrogel was evaluated through cell viability and mineralized matrix assays. Results showed no cytotoxic effects, with significant cell proliferation over time. HDPCs displayed an increase in mineralization nodules when cultured with GelMA functionalized with MSCH containing 2%, 5%, and 10% simvastatin. However, only the 10% concentration resulted in a significant increase. Thus, incorporating chitosan microspheres with 10% simvastatin into GelMA creates a controlled release system with high potential for direct pulp capping. © 2025 The Author(s).

While screening typically relies on age and smoking intensity, more efficient risk models exist. We devised a Bayesian network (BN) for LC detection, testing its resilience with varying degrees of missing data and comparing it to a prior machine learning (ML) model. Methods: We analyzed data from 9940 patients referred for LC assessment in Southern Denmark from 2009 to 2018. Variables included age, sex, smoking, and lab results. Our experiments varied missing data (0%–30%), BN structure (expert-based vs. data-driven), and discretization method (standard vs. data-driven). Results: Across all missing data levels, area under the curve (AUC) remained steady, ranging from 0.737 to 0.757, compared to the ML model's AUC of 0.77. BN structure and discretization method had minimal impact on performance. BNs were well calibrated overall, with a net benefit in decision curve analysis when predicted risk exceeded 5%. Conclusion: BN models showed resilience with up to 30% missing values. Moreover, these BNs exhibited similar performance, calibration, and clinical utility compared to the machine learning model developed using the same dataset. Considering their effectiveness in handling missing data, BNs emerge as a relevant method for the development of future lung cancer detection models. © 2025 The Author(s).

There is interest in leveraging real-world data (RWD) from electronic health records (EHRs) to construct external control (EC) arms to supplement RCT control arms and form hybrid control (HC) arms. This investigation showed the use of an HC arm in second-line metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The RCT experimental arm (atezolizumab + PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase (Atezo + PEGPH20)) was compared with an HC arm consisting of patients treated with modified FOLFOX6 or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel from the MORPHEUS PDAC internal control arm supplemented with data from a nationwide EHR-derived de-identified database as the EC arm. The EC arm was constructed by applying key inclusion/exclusion criteria from the MORPHEUS PDAC trial to patients from the real-world cohort. Baseline variables were balanced using propensity score matching and covariate adjustment. Three analysis approaches—Cox model with pooled-control data, Cox model with control arm-specific frailty, and Bayesian analysis using a commensurate prior—were assessed. Overall survival was similar between the treatment arms. The direction and magnitude of hazard ratios (HRs) from the multiple HC analyses (HRs ranged from 1.02 to 1.06) were comparable with the reported trial HR (HR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.56, 1.49).

A simpler once-daily dosing schedule is critical to ensure patient-friendly regimens with good adherence. We assessed expected drug exposures with proposed once-daily doses for adults and compared novel model-informed once-daily dosing strategies for children with current World Health Organization (WHO) recommended dosing. A reference individual and virtual pediatric population were generated to simulate exposures in adults and children, respectively. Published population models characterizing the exposures of bedaquiline and its metabolite M2, delamanid, and its metabolite DM-6705 were utilized. During simulation, child growth during treatment along with several CYP3A4 ontogeny profiles was accounted for. Exposures in children were compared with simulated adult targets to assess the expected treatment efficacy and safety. In adults, the proposed bedaquiline once-daily dosing (400 mg daily for 2 weeks followed by 100 mg daily for 22 weeks) yielded 14% higher exposures of bedaquiline and M2 compared to the labeled dosing scheme at 24 weeks; for delamanid and DM-6705, the suggested 300 mg daily dose provided 13% lower exposures at steady state. For children, the cumulative proportions of exposures of both drugs showed < 5% difference between WHO-recommended and proposed once-daily dosing. This study demonstrated the use of model-informed approaches to propose rational and simpler regimens for bedaquiline and delamanid in adults and children. The new once-daily dosing strategies will be tested in the PARADIGM4TB and IMPAACT 2020 trials in adults and children, respectively. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study aimed to refine the understanding of creatinine kinetics for more reliable assessments of GFR and net creatinine tubular secretion (nCTS) via OCT2/MATE in humans. In a clinical study of 14 healthy volunteers, iohexol was administered intravenously as a reference GFR marker, and creatinine was introduced through a meat meal. A joint pharmacometric model was developed using dense plasma and urine sampling. Simulations were used to evaluate the effect of different creatinine volume of distribution (Vd) values on GFR estimation after acute kidney injury (AKI) and to assess the impact of limited sampling strategies on GFR and nCTS estimation. Pharmacokinetic parameters for iohexol and creatinine aligned with reported values, but a lower Vd of 41% of total body weight and a nCTS fraction of 31% relative to overall creatinine clearance were observed. Commonly used equations based on single-point creatinine measurement all overestimated GFR, with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation performing best, followed by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 2009 equation. Simulations demonstrate the effect of Vd estimate accuracy on detecting AKI from creatinine plasma concentrations only. Following low-dose iohexol administration, a single plasma sample at 5 hours and a urine sample from 0 to 5 hours provided accurate estimates of both GFR and nCTS using the joint model and enabled adequate correction for incomplete urine collection. This approach shows promise for assessing renal transporter activity based on estimated nCTS. © 2025 The Author(s).

Therefore, compared with the daytime, the infiltration of lymphocytes into immune-reactive tissues is enhanced at night. This study aimed to determine whether the administration of methylprednisolone (mPSL) in the evening is more effective against T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) after liver transplantation compared with morning administration. This study used a randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparison design. Pediatric patients scheduled to undergo living-donor liver transplantation were randomly divided into morning (8:00 a.m.) and evening (8:00 p.m.) mPSL administration groups. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of TCMR within 14 days of surgery. Sixty-two patients were enrolled between 2014 and 2023, and six patients were excluded from the analysis as their dose of mPSL deviated from the protocol within 14 days after surgery. Of the 56 subjects analyzed, TCMR was detected in 10 of the morning group (n = 29) and three of the evening group (n = 27) within 14 days after surgery. Stratified analysis of patients who did not receive preoperative rituximab treatment showed that none of the evening group and 36.4% of the morning group developed TCMR within 14 days after surgery (P < 0.01, 95% confidence interval; 2.00–infinity). Safety evaluation results were comparable between the two groups. This study shows that the evening administration of mPSL is an effective approach for suppressing TCMR.

Islam M.N.; Liu Y.; Herr A.E.,Electromigration of Charged Analytes Through Immiscible Fluids in Multiphasic Electrophoresis,2025,Electrophoresis,10.1002/elps.202400192,"Multiphasic buffer systems have been of greatest interest in electrophoresis and liquid–liquid electrotransfer; this study extends that foundation by exploring the interplay of the geometric and viscous properties of an interleaving oil layer on the electrotransfer of a charged analyte from an aqueous solution into a hydrogel. We utilized finite element analysis to examine two complementary configurations: one being electrotransfer of a charged analyte (protein) in an aqueous phase into a surrounding hydrogel layer and another being electrotransfer of the protein from that originating aqueous phase—through an interleaving oil layer of predetermined viscosity and thickness—and into a surrounding hydrogel layer. Results indicate that the presence of an oil layer leads to increased skew of the injected peak. To explain this difference in injection dispersion, we utilize Probstein's framework and compare the Péclet (Pe) number with the ratio between length scales characteristic to the axial and radial dispersion, respectively. The formulation assigns electrotransfer conditions into six different dispersion regimes. We show that the presence or absence of an interleaving oil layer moves the observed peak dispersion into distinct electrotransfer regimes; the presence of an oil layer augments the electrophoretic mobility mismatch among the different phases, resulting in a five-fold increase in Pe and a six-fold increase in the ratio between the axial to radial dispersion characteristic lengths. We further show that oil viscosity significantly influences resultant injection dispersion. A decrease in oil-layer viscosity from 0.08 to 0.02 Pa s results in a >100% decrease in injection dispersion. Our theoretical predictions were experimentally validated by comparing the electrotransfer regimes of three different mineral oil samples. We show that lowering the oil viscosity to 0.0039 Pa s results in an injection regime similar to that of the absence of an oil layer. Understanding of the impact of electrotransfer of charged species across multiple immiscible fluid layers on peak dispersion informs the design of multiphasic electrophoresis systems. © 2024 The Author(s).

Methods: A total of 18 individuals with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) underwent LSG. Clinical data, cognitive scores, and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were evaluated before LSG and 12 months after LSG. We employed voxel-based morphometry analysis and seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis to assess LSG-induced structural and functional changes in mOFC. Partial correlation analysis and univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to explore associations among biochemical indexes, neuroimaging, cognition, and weight loss. Results: No significant improvement in general cognition was found after LSG. Decreases in gray matter volume of the bilateral mOFC and increases in RSFC of the right mOFC were observed 12 months after LSG. Weight loss was associated with RSFC, general cognitive scores, and triglyceride changes. Multivariate linear regression model revealed gray matter volume of the left mOFC and working memory scores at baseline explained 55.2% of the variation in weight loss. Conclusions: These findings suggest that mOFC imaging and cognitive scores could serve as biomarkers for predicting persistent weight loss after LSG, which provides a solid foundation for a potential target for neuromodulation research. © 2025 The Author(s).

In this study, we characterized the effects of β-blockers on mouse pancreatic β-cells. Unexpectedly, high concentrations (100 μM) of β-blockers (propranolol and bisoprolol) paradoxically increased cAMP levels 5–10 fold, enhanced Ca2+ influx, and stimulated a 2–4 fold increase in glucose- and glimepiride-induced insulin secretion in MIN6-K8 clonal β-cells and isolated mouse pancreatic islets. These effects were observed despite minimal expression of β-adrenoceptors in these cells. Mechanistically, the cAMP increase led to ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) phosphorylation via protein kinase A (PKA), triggering Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). CICR then activates transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5), resulting in increased Ca2+ influx via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. These effects contradict the conventional understanding of the pharmacology of β-blockers, highlighting the variability in β-blocker actions depending on the experimental context. © 2025 The Author(s).

To ensure microbiological efficacy, a ratio of AUC/MIC ≥400 is recommended. However, there is significant interindividual variability in its pharmacokinetic parameters, necessitating therapeutic drug monitoring to adjust dosing regimens and ensure efficacy while avoiding toxicity. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models enable dose personalization, but the challenge lies in the choice of the model to use among the multitude of models in the literature. We compared 18 PopPK models created from populations with the same sociodemographic and clinicobiological characteristics. Simulations were performed for a 47 years old man, weighing 70 kg, with an albumin level of 35.5 g/L, a creatinine clearance of 100 mL/min, an eGFR of 106 mL/min/1.73 m2, and receiving an intravenous infusion of 1 g × 2/day of VCM over 1 h for 48 h. Simulations of time–concentration profiles revealed differences, leading us to determine the probability of achieving microbiological efficacy (AUC/MIC ≥ 400) with each model. Depending on some models, a dose of 1 g × 2/day is required to ensure microbiological efficacy in over 90% of the population, while with the same dose other models do not exceed 10% of the population. To ensure that 90% of the patients are correctly exposed, a dose of vancomycin ranging from 0.9 g × 2/day to 2.2 g × 2/day is necessary a priori depending on the chosen model. These differences raise an issue in choosing a model for performing therapeutic drug monitoring using a PopPK model with or without Bayesian approach. Thus, it is fundamental to evaluate the impact of these differences on both efficacy/toxicity. © 2024 The Author(s).

Insights from PBPK modeling,2025,CPT: Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology,10.1002/psp4.13254,"Empirical maturation models (e.g., Johnson and Rhodin models) for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are commonly used as scaling factors for predicting pediatric renal clearance, but their predictive performance for drugs featured with tubular reabsorption is poorly understood. This study investigated the adequacy of GFR-based scaling models for predicting pediatric renal clearance in drugs with passive tubular reabsorption by comparing with a mechanistic kidney model (Mech-KiM) that encompasses the physiological processes of glomerular filtration, tubular secretion, and reabsorption. The analysis utilized hypothetical drugs with varying fractions of tubular reabsorption (Freabs), alongside the model drug metronidazole, which has a Freabs of 96%. Our simulations showed that when Freabs is ≤70%, the discrepancies between the GFR-based scaling methods and the Mech-KiM model in predicting pediatric renal clearance were generally within a twofold range throughout childhood. However, for drugs with substantial tubular reabsorption (e.g., Freabs > 70%), discrepancies greater than twofold were observed between the GFR-based scaling methods and the Mech-KiM model in predicting renal clearance for young children. In neonates, the differences ranged from 5- to 10-fold when the adult Freabs was 95%. Pediatric physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of metronidazole revealed that using a GFR-based scaling method (Johnson model) significantly overestimated drug concentrations in children under 2 months, whereas utilizing the Mech-KiM model for renal clearance predictions yielded estimates closely aligned with observed concentrations.

In total, 1501 patients from FILLY (NCT02503332), OAKS (NCT03525613), and DERBY (NCT03525600) received intravitreal pegcetacoplan 15 mg monthly or every other month (EOM) or sham treatment monthly or EOM and were included in the population analysis of lesion area. Disease progression over time was adequately described as linear-with-time over the 24-month maximal study duration. Disease-specific covariates associated with slower lesion growth were unilateral, unifocal, and subfoveal GA lesions and >20 intermediate or large drusen groups (≥63 μm) at baseline. The dose–response model estimated 0.80-fold (95% CI: 0.75, 0.84) and 0.83-fold (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) reductions in GA lesion growth rate with pegcetacoplan monthly and EOM, respectively, versus sham. A relationship between vitreous humor concentration and GA lesion growth rate was quantified as 2.6% per unit of log-transformed vitreous pegcetacoplan concentration in the PK/PD model. PK/PD predictions of treatment effect based on exposure (pegcetacoplan monthly: 0.80 [90% CI: 0.77, 0.84]; pegcetacoplan EOM: 0.83 [90% CI: 0.80, 0.86]) were consistent with predictions based on dose response. These results support the benefit of pegcetacoplan administered monthly or EOM in slowing GA lesion growth. © 2024 The Author(s).

Here, we report the first data of mirikizumab pharmacokinetics (PK) and exposure–response (E/R) relationships in pediatric participants (aged 2 to <18 years weighing >10 kg) with moderate-to-severe UC from the phase II, open-label study SHINE-1 (NCT04004611). PK parameters were analyzed using a model developed previously in adults with fixed-exponent allometry for body weight. Serum samples collected from 26 participants during the 12-week induction and 40-week maintenance periods of SHINE-1 were analyzed. Estimated body weight-adjusted systemic clearance, volume of distribution, and subcutaneous bioavailability were 0.021 L/h, 0.069 L/kg, and 49.8%, respectively. Covariate analysis identified no clinically significant covariates other than body weight. In the exposure range studied, E/R analysis using post hoc grouping by average concentration quartile and comparison of observed change from baseline in modified Mayo Score (MMS) at Week 12 with the adult model prediction revealed no obvious E/R relationship in clinical response, clinical remission, or endoscopic response, consistent with observations in adults. The E/R relationship for observed change from baseline in MMS at Week 12 is also similar to the adult model prediction. The PK modeling and E/R analyses suggested optimal doses of intravenous mirikizumab 300 mg for weight >40 kg, 5 mg/kg for weight ≤40 kg every 4 weeks (Q4W) during induction, and subcutaneous mirikizumab 200 mg (>40 kg), 100 mg (>20 to ≤40 kg), or 50 mg (≤20 kg) Q4W during maintenance therapy for pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe UC. © 2024 Eli Lilly and Company.

This study aimed to investigate the PK of total and unbound concentrations of imatinib and the metabolite N-desmethyl imatinib in hospitalized patients with different severities of COVID-19, and to assess the impact of critical illness and the potential drug–drug interaction with IL-6R inhibitors on imatinib exposure. Imatinib, N-desmethyl imatinib, and AAG were quantified from collected plasma samples. The PK data was further combined with previous data from COVID-19 patients and chronic myelogenous leukemia/gastrointestinal stromal tumor (CML/GIST) patients who received imatinib. A population PK analysis was conducted using a standard sequential approach. Unbound fraction in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and treated with IL-6R inhibitors was significantly elevated compared to CML/GIST patients (4.66% vs. 3.54% [1.08%–8.51%]; p < 0.001), despite twofold increased AAG levels. Our findings on total and unbound concentration show that cotreatment with IL-6R inhibitor can lead to changes in metabolism and protein binding, suggesting similar implications for other highly protein bound drugs. Consequently, total concentrations may not accurately reflect unbound target site concentrations. © 2025 The Author(s).

Previous exposure-QTcF analyses in patients with active TB were able to alleviate the limitation of QTcF but required advanced model-based methodologies, incorporating a non-drug-related, “secular” trend in the model to dissociate drug and non-drug-related effects on QT. Recently, we developed and validated a time-varying QT correction method (QTcTBT) that more accurately accounts for the HR changes during TB treatment. In the present work, using data from 429 patients with multidrug-resistant TB across two Phase IIb trials, we re-evaluated the exposure-QTc relationship for bedaquiline by applying QTcTBT instead of QTcF. Our analysis showed that when HR changes were accounted for using QTcTBT, a typical maximum M2 (bedaquiline metabolite) concentration (326 ng/mL, mean maximal concentration (Cmax) at the end of 2-week loading phase) was associated with a 7 ms QTc interval prolongation (90% CI: 5.9–8.2). This estimate closely aligns with the previously reported M2 effect of 7.9 ms (90% CI: 6.8–9.3), derived from the exposure-QTcF model. The consistency between the two methodologies further supports the use of QTcTBT for estimating the QTc prolongation effects of anti-TB drugs. © 2025 The Author(s).

By validating its prognostic value, this study aims to contribute to more personalized treatment strategies for a/mRCC. Methods: In a multicenter retrospective study by the JK-FOOT consortium, we analyzed data from 309 a/mRCC patients undergoing ICI-based therapy. The CANLPH score—a composite marker of C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet to hemoglobin ratio (PHR)—for its prognostic accuracy in predicting cancer-specific survival (CSS). Advanced statistical methods, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Cox proportional-hazard regression, and Harrell’s concordance index (C-index), were employed to assess its predictive capacity against established factors. Results: The median follow-up period was 17 months, revealing two-year and five-year overall survival rates of 76.8% and 62.4%, respectively, with CSS rates at 78.3% and 66.2%. The CANLPH score well stratified survival outcomes of ICI-based treatment for RCC patients (HR 5.71; P < 0.0001). C-index analysis demonstrated that the CANLPH score had the highest predictive potency for CSS among models, including IMDC score. Multivariate analysis confirmed the CANLPH score (HR, 5.59; P = 0.0007) and Karnofsky performance status (HR, 2.59; P = 0.0032) as independent prognostic factors for CSS. Conclusions: The CANLPH score emerges as a critical tool in the a/mRCC therapeutic landscape, enabling precise prediction of patient outcomes with ICI-based therapies. Limitations include the retrospective design and the single national cohort.

While seed amplification assays (SAA) have demonstrated ultrasensitive detection of misfolded αSyn, they have been primarily used reliably to provide binary (positive/negative) results for diagnostic purposes. We developed an SAA with enhanced specificity for Lewy-fold α-synucleinopathies and introduced a quantifiable measure correlating with clinical severity. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 170 patients with neurodegenerative diseases and controls was analyzed. Blinded measurements demonstrated 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity for Lewy-fold α-synucleinopathies, correctly identifying PD and DLB while excluding MSA. In addition, we validated the strain specificity of the assay by testing brain homogenates from 30 neuropathologically confirmed cases. A novel Lewy-fold pathology (LFP) score based on positive signals in a dilution series provided a quantitative measure of αSyn seeds. The LFP score significantly correlated with motor and cognitive impairment presented by Hoehn and Yahr stage, MDS-UPDRS III, and MoCA. Longitudinal tracking in seven PD cases showed progressive LFP score increases corresponding with clinical deterioration, highlighting the assay’s potential for monitoring disease progression at an individual level. Our Lewy-fold-specific SAA enhances ante-mortem diagnosis and differentiates Lewy-fold α-synucleinopathies from MSA. Unlike previous assays, the LFP score offers a quantitative assessment, showing promise as a progression marker and pharmacodynamic biomarker for αSyn-targeting therapies. This represents an important step toward developing an αSyn SAA that could help to track disease progression quantitatively, with potential applications in both clinical diagnostics and therapeutic trials. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219152433,Lewy body; Synucleinopathies

The rare-earth-doped KCa(BO3)2 compounds were successfully synthesized, and coated via the spin-coating method, followed by detailed structural and compositional analysis using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM–EDS). FT-IR confirmed the characteristic B–O vibrational modes within the [BO₃]⁻ units, while P-XRD revealed well-defined crystalline phases. ICP-MS analysis verified the elemental stoichiometry in agreement with theoretical values, and SEM–EDS illustrated homogeneous surface morphology. The electrical and photoresponse characteristics of the fabricated heterojunctions were evaluated under variable illumination intensities through current–voltage (I–V) and current–time (I–t) measurements. Key device metrics—including photosensitivity (K), responsivity (R), and specific detectivity (D*)—were extracted to assess photodetector efficiency. Notably, the Al/KCaLa(BO3)2/Si configuration exhibited deviced performance, with higher photocurrent generation, enhanced responsivity, and improved detectivity compared to its Nd-doped counterpart. These findings not only demonstrate the efficacy of rare-earth-doped orthoborate interlayers in silicon photodiodes but also establish a promising platform for the advancement of high-sensitivity optoelectronic devices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012502231,Photodiode

As non-human primates (NHP) are more similar to humans than rodents, the current study investigated whether it was possible to reproduce in a NHP, the previously obtained beneficial results by using a plasma-synthesized polypyrrole/iodine (PPy/I) biopolymer, which reduce glial scar formation and inflammatory response and promotes nerve tissue preservation, regenerative processes and functional recovery in rats. In NHPs (Rhesus monkey) with SCI by complete transection (SCT) and with plasma-synthesized PPy/I application (experimental) or without (control), the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood, preservation of nervous tissue through magnetic resonance imaging and histological and morphometric techniques, regeneration through immunohistochemistry study and functional recovery through clinical examination, were evaluated. Control NHP showed a markedly increased of pro-inflammatory cytokines vs. experimental NHP, which preserved more nerve tissue. At the end of the follow-up, a thinner glial scar in the injured spinal cord was observed in the experimental NHP as well as regenerative nerve processes (NeuN and β-III tubulin expression), while control NHP had a marked glial scar, large cysts and less nerve tissue at the injured zone. Plasma-synthesized PPy/I also reduced the loss of pelvic limb muscle mass and allowed the experimental NHP recovered knee-jerk, withdrawal and plantar reflexes as well as movement in the hind limbs. Since most of the beneficial effects of plasma-synthesized PPy/I previously reported in rats were also observed in the NHP, these preliminary findings make their replication in humans with SCI more likely. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218942167,Biopolymer; Polypyrrole

Recombinant SDF-1 (0.5–5.0 μg) was combined with OCP granules through lyophilization. OCP/SDF-1 granules were implanted into a rat femoral standardized defect for 2 and 4 weeks and subjected to histomorphometry, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and osteocalcin immunohistomorphometry, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) was used as a control for in vitro analyses. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) migration was estimated using a Transwell system with OCP/SDF-1. SDF-1 release from OCP/SDF-1 into the supernatant was determined without cells. SDF-1 adsorption in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer onto OCP, the chemical structure of OCP immersed in the medium using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the degree of supersaturation of the medium were determined. Bone regeneration and OCP degradation were enhanced the most by 1.0 μg of OCP/SDF-1 at 2 weeks after implantation by CT analysis and increasing CXCR4-positive, osteocalcin-positive, and TRAP-positive cells accumulation around the OCP. MSC migration increased until 48 h in the following order: SDF-1 only, CDHA/SDF-1, and OCP/SDF-1, with the greatest effect with 1.0 μg of SDF-1 than from OCP. CDHA promoted a greater release than OCP at 48 h. The physicochemical analyses indicated that SDF-1 interacted with OCP through Freundlich-type adsorption and that the adsorption controlled SDF-1 release from OCP during the hydrolysis into CDHA. Therefore, leveraging its molecular affinity for the OCP surface, OCP/SDF-1 facilitates MSC migration and enhances bone formation by ensuring the controlled, sustained release of SDF-1 from OCP. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219591829,Octacalcium phosphate

The existence of EVE on CNT/OMC/CS nanocarrier is confirmed by FE-SEM images, Raman, UV-Vis, FT-IR, BET and TGA analyses. The results showed that the introduction of CS improved the drug loading by 89.4% at pH 7.0, time 2 h and EVE to CNT/OMC/CS ratio of 1.5. Moreover, release study of EVE showed that 15.2% of EVE is released from EVE@CNT/OMC/CS at pH=7.4 for 15 h, while 78.9% of EVE is released at pH = 4.5. After 25 h, 16.8% and 88.0% of EVE were released at pH 7.4 and 4.5, respectively.

This study showed that tris-(2-pyridine carboxylate) chromium (III) (complex 1) exhibited an increased electrochemical reaction rate in the presence of a strong acid, suggesting that PCET via proton donation promotes the reduction reaction. Conversely, complex 1 with picolinic acid showed a decreased electrochemical exchange constant, suggesting kinetic control by slow electronic exchange, consistent with PCET. Bis(pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate) chromate (III) of sodium (complex 2), showed potential shifts and broadening of signals in the presence of dipicolinic and ascorbic acids, further supporting the involvement of PCET. Overall, the study highlighted the modulation of the electrochemical behavior of the chromium complexes through proton-coupled shifts in reduction potentials and kinetics, shedding light on their potential interactions with cellular reductant agents and protons.

The study of the surface properties, even if at a fundamental level, is of central importance because the surface is the place where electrochemical, physical, and biological interactions take place; this is critical especially for biomedical applications, in which these interactions affect each other. The present work investigates the effect of low-energy oxygen implantation, in the range of − 1 to − 5 kV, for different durations on commercially pure Zn, whose surface had been mechanically polished. The characterization of the as-received and implanted surface was carried out with standard and high-resolution electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, sessile drop contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and potentiodynamic tests. The plasma-treated surface showed distinct features related to the process parameters, such as the formation of surface waves and oxide agglomerates. The formation of an O-rich layer with specific morphological features was responsible for a slight modification of the corrosion rate, found to be generally lower for longer-time implanted samples being, for instance, ~ 78 ± 26 μm year−1 for samples implanted applying − 1 kV for 60 min compared to that of untreated samples, which is ~ 135 ± 9 μm year−1. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000009553,Degradation; Immersion; Plasma-immersion ion implantation; Surface Modification
Bayoumi N.A.,Synthesis of Radioiodinated Silica-Coated Magnetic Nanoparticles as SPECT/MR Dual-Modality Probe for Bone Imaging,2025,Journal of Pharmaceutical Innovation,10.1007/s12247-025-10011-w,"Purpose: A reliable imaging probe is essential for the accurate diagnosis of diseases and to support effective therapeutic decision-making. Different nanoparticles based multimodal probes have been studied for bone imaging. This work focuses on synthesizing of radiolabeled iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles as a promising dual modality bioprobe (SPECT/MR) for bone imaging. Methods: In this work, silica coated magnetic nanoparticles (SiO2@MNPs) were synthesized. Radioiodination of SiO2@MNPs with iodine − 131 was performed via the Finkelstein reaction to produce a prospective radioiodinated MNPs for bone targeting. Results: The radioiodinated NPs were obtained in high radiochemical purity (about 98.5 ± 0.5%) by magnet separation. The aqueous dispersion of the radioiodinated silica coated MNPs (131I-SiO2@MNPs) exhibited adequate in-vitro stability and biocompatibility. Biodistribution study results after intravenous injection of (131I-SiO2@MNPs) in normal mice revealed the high bone targeting efficiency of the radiolabeled NPs (Cmax= 6± 0.5% ID/g at tmax= 2 h post injection). Magnetization properties measurements proved the preservation of the magnetic properties of SiO2@MNPs after the iodination process retaining its effectiveness as MRI contrast agent. Conclusion: Based on to the results of this study, 131I-SiO2@MNPs could be considered as a promising candidate for SPECT/MR dual bone imaging. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008722411,Biocompatibility; Biodistribution; MRI contrast agent; Spect imaging

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a straightforward and cost-effective indicator, measures the variability in red blood cell size and is conventionally employed in hematological assessments for anemia differentiation. Nonetheless, limited research has explored the causal link between RDW levels and lung cancer incidence. Methods: Initially, Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to explore the underlying causal connection between RDW and lung cancer. To ensure the robustness of the MR findings, sensitivity analyses were conducted. Following this, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database was utilized to further substantiate the influence of RDW on the prognosis of lung cancer. Results: The MR analysis revealed a significant association between RDW and lung cancer risk in the European population (OR IVW 1.11, 95% CI 1.03–1.20, p = 0.006; OR Weighted-median 1.16, 95% CI 1.03–1.31, p = 0.013; OR MR-Egger 1.14, 95% CI 1.00–1.30, p = 0.059). Furthermore, findings from the NHANES database suggested that lower RDW values are associated with improved prognosis in lung cancer patients (HR 2, 95% CI 1.07–3.74, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study provides further evidence for the relationship between RDW levels and lung cancer, highlighting the potential significance of RDW as a biomarker for predicting lung cancer risk and prognosis. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005968429,Mendelian Randomization

These comorbid diseases complicate treatment. However, the impact of these comorbidities on survival outcomes and complications in elderly patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains under-researched. Methods: This cohort study examined ESCC patients aged 70 and older who underwent esophagectomy. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those without preoperative comorbid diseases (NCD group) and those with preoperative comorbid diseases (CD group). Data were obtained from the Sichuan Cancer Hospital and Institute Esophageal Cancer Case Management Database between May 2016 and August 2021, with follow-up concluding on December 20, 2023. Results: A total of 469 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 206 patients in the comorbid diseases (CD group) and 263 patients without (NCD group). The median follow-up period was 47.5 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 51.6 months and median disease-free survival (DFS) was 33.0 months, with no statistically significant difference in OS and DFS in 2 groups. The incidence of grade 3 or higher complications in the NCD and CD groups was similar, with no statistically significant difference. The most common grade 3 or higher complications were pulmonary infection, hydrothorax, anastomotic stenosis, and anastomotic leakage. Conclusions: Preoperative comorbidities, including CHD, COPD, DM, and HBP, did not significantly impact the long-term survival or disease-free survival of elderly ESCC patients undergoing esophagectomy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006935305,Esophagectomy

This study aims to evaluate circulating chemokines, cytokines and leukocytes in the blood of patients with BC. Methods: A prospective study involving 200 women with infiltrative breast carcinoma was conducted. Patients were stratified by TNM stage and IHC subtype for survival analysis and correlations with the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and the expression of 13 chemokines and 3 cytokines. Results: Survival was significantly higher in women with early-stage tumors (I/II) and in Luminal A and HER2 + subtypes. No significant differences in NLR were observed across TNM stages or IH subtypes. Among the 172 non-metastatic patients, those with NLR > 2 had shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (multivariate analysis). In the Luminal B subgroup, patients with NLR > 2 exhibited worse progression-free survival (PFS) (multivariate analysis), while in the triple-negative (TN) subgroup NLR > 3 was associated with poorer overall survival (OS) (univariate analysis). NLR was prognostic during follow-up, with lower OS observed in patients with NLR > 3 at 12 months post-diagnosis. Significant correlations were identified among 8 CC/CXC chemokines. Furthermore, leukocyte count was significantly correlated with IL-6, RANTES/CCL5, and GRO-Alpha/CXCL1; lymphocytes with MCP1/CCL2; and monocytes with IP10/CXCL10. NLR was significantly correlated with RANTES/CCL5. Conclusion: Risk stratification in BC patients is grounded in tumor staging and immunohistochemistry. However, systemic inflammatory responses, including cytokine- and chemokine-mediated signaling of neutrophils and lymphocytes, play a critical role in modulating prognosis. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007668139,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Zhang S.; Xu L.; Gao D.; Zhang H.; Wei S.,Prognostic significance of preoperative abdominal fat thickness for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,2025,Discover Oncology,10.1007/s12672-025-02987-1,"Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical value of abdominal fat thickness (AFT) as a predictor of outcomes for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods: Between August 2016 and March 2023, we retrospectively gathered data on 148 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for PDAC at the Hepatobiliary Surgery Department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. We conducted a comparative analysis of laboratory results and radiological features between patients who developed postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) and those who did not. To identify predictive factors, we employed both univariate and multivariate analytical methods.Furthermore, we conducted prognostic assessments for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), taking into account AFT and various patient-related factors. Results: POPF developed in 46 patients (31.1%). AFT > 74.2 mm was associated with a risk of POPF, high body mass index (BMI), operation time and soft pancreatic texture. Patients with POPF were significantly more likely to have high BMI (> 23.2 kg/m2),Intra-abdominal infection, and high AFT than patients without POPF. In the multivariate analysis, high AFT (OR,13.678;95% CI,1.848-101.236;p = 0.01) was the sole independent predictive factor for POPF. Compared with PDAC patients with low AFT values, high AFT patients showed significantly worse OS (HR,2.646; 95% CI, 1.516,4.618;p = 0.001) and RFS (HR, 3.612; 95% CI, 1.949,6.693; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Patients who have experienced POPF have been shown to exhibit a high correlation with AFT. Among the various parameters examined, AFT has emerged as an independent predictive factor for clinically significant POPF. Additionally, our cohort study showed that AFT was associated with poor clinical outcomes in PDAC patients following surgical resection. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008738916,Clinical Significance
Sanz-Codina M.; Nowak H.; Zeitlinger M.,Host Biomarkers and Antibiotic Tissue Penetration in Sepsis: Insights from Moxifloxacin,2025,European Journal of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics,10.1007/s13318-025-00945-4,"Background and Objective: Sepsis-induced pathophysiological changes may lead to pharmacokinetic variability which alters antibiotic concentrations at the host infection site. This poses a challenge in clinical practice, as sufficient antibiotic concentrations in tissue are necessary to effectively eradicate bacterial pathogens. In this exploratory study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of routinely used laboratory biomarkers to predict subcutaneous and muscle tissue penetration of moxifloxacin in septic patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 10 septic patients included in a pharmacokinetic study, in which moxifloxacin concentrations in subcutaneous adipose and muscle tissues were measured with microdialysis. We correlated the tissue-to-plasma ratio and protein binding with various clinical biomarkers. Results: Our results revealed significant correlations for CRP, LDH, BUN, GPT, and total protein with moxifloxacin subcutaneous penetration, and BUN, GOT, and GPT with muscle penetration. Notably, all biomarkers except CRP correlated negatively with tissue penetration. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between moxifloxacin protein binding and total plasma proteins and albumin. Conclusion: Biomarker tissue correlations suggest that the penetration of moxifloxacin into tissues is a complex process influenced by factors like inflammation, tissue integrity, liver function, protein levels, and renal function. Understanding these interactions might help optimize antibiotic dosing strategies. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003739817,Host response; Human physiology

We aimed to develop a pharmacokinetic model for unbound and total lidocaine by intraperitoneal and intravenous routes. Methods: Unbound and total lidocaine concentrations, and pain scores (visual analogue score 0–10) were from a published randomized control trial of adults (n = 56) undergoing laparoscopic colon resection. Participants received intravenous or intraperitoneal lidocaine (2 mg/kg bolus then 1.5 mg/kg/h infusion) for 72 h postoperatively. Data were pooled with literature-derived alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentrations (AAG) to support total lidocaine modelling. Unbound kinetics were described using compartmental models with first order absorption between intraperitoneal and plasma compartments. A turnover model described AAG kinetics with constant binding to lidocaine. An inhibitory pharmacodynamic model was explored to link concentration to pain scores. Results: Maximum lidocaine concentrations after intraperitoneal administration were means (range) of 3.0 (0.4–4.5) mg/L total and 0.6 (0.1–0.9) mg/L unbound. Intraperitoneal absorption was incomplete (bioavailability = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6–0.76) with a half-time of 0.5 (0.4–0.8) h. A two-compartment model with first order elimination fit best, with unbound clearance 121 (108–136) L/h/70 kg. The binding constant to AAG (KD) was 2.98 (2.69–3.35) µmol/L. A pharmacodynamic model with C50 of 0.21 mg/L and maximal reduction (Emax) of 6 units captured pain scores and was used to simulate dosing strategies. Conclusions: A third of the intraperitoneal dose did not reach the central compartment and absorption took ~2 h. Simulations show that 2 mg/kg/h intraperitoneal infusion achieves a 5-point pain score reduction within ~36 min. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004466414,Human physiology; Pain medicine

Aficamten is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism with renal excretion playing a minor role. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of aficamten in moderate hepatic impairment or mild to moderate renal impairment to inform dosing recommendations in HCM patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment or mild to moderate renal impairment. Methods: The impact of hepatic impairment on the PK of single-dose aficamten 20 mg was evaluated in a phase 1 single-dose, open-label, parallel-group study, in healthy participants with moderate (n = 8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B classification) versus participants with normal hepatic function (n = 8). Safety was monitored throughout. The effect of renal impairment on aficamten PK was assessed using population PK (PopPK) modelling of phase 2/3 clinical data in patients with oHCM. Results: Aficamten PK was similar in participants with moderate hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function. No serious or severe treatment-emergent adverse events or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were reported. There were no clinical meaningful differences in aficamten exposure in patients with oHCM with mild or moderate renal impairment and those with normal renal function. Conclusions: No clinically relevant changes in aficamten PK were observed in participants with moderate hepatic impairment. Population PK analysis indicated mild or moderate renal impairment and had no statistically or clinically significant impact on aficamten PK in patients with oHCM. Aficamten dose adjustment may not be necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic or renal impairment. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218005601,Functional impairment

The objective of this study was to define meropenem plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamic exposure metrics in children with septic shock during the first 3 days of PICU hospitalization. Methods: We prospectively evaluated meropenem clearance (CLMERO) and volume of distribution (V1-MERO), innovatively assessing renal biomarkers (serum creatinine [SCr], serum cystatin C [SCys], and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [SNgal]), in infants aged ≥ 4 weeks and children on intravenous (IV) meropenem 20 mg/kg every 8 h from 2019 to 2023. Cases with sepsis were matched to controls without sepsis. Results: Analysis included 27 participants (19 cases and 8 controls) with 309 meropenem serum concentrations. Median age was 11.8 (range 0.6–19.6) years, weight 36.3 (7.2–98.0) kg, SCr 0.33 (0.09–2.57) mg/dL, SCys 451.1 (178.3–1824.1) ng/mL, and SNgal 180.7 (23.2–1403.0) ng/mL. A 2-compartment, population pharmacokinetic (PK) model via NONMEM best described data, with weight on VMERO and allometric scaling on CLMERO. Using the final model with SCys in V1-MERO and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-MS in CLMERO, the median V1-MERO was 0.23 (range 0.07–0.57) L/kg and CLMERO 0.15 (0.05–0.49) L/h/kg, with eGFR–MS 139 (23–365) mL/min/1.73 m2 from AKI to ARC. Meropenem clearance, V1-MERO and eGFR-MS were significantly decreased in cases versus controls, with higher variability of eGFR-MS in cases. Conclusion: Wide variation in meropenem concentrations in children with sepsis as compared to those without sepsis prompt close monitoring of GFR and drug concentrations in this population. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003464955,Population Pharmacokinetics

The objectives of this study were to describe the population pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in hospitalised patients treated for COVID-19 and develop a model to inform dose optimisation in clinical use. Methods: This was a prospective, open-labelled, multi-centre, observational study in four Australian hospitals in adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were administered the licensed remdesivir dose. Remdesivir and GS-441524 concentrations were quantified in multiple plasma samples at different times in the dosing interval by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Patients were divided into two groups: pharmacokinetic model building and external validation. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was built using non-linear mixed-effects modelling. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to describe the impact of age, kidney function and dosing regimen on drug concentrations. Results: In total, 33 patients were enrolled (median age 70 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). The pharmacokinetics for both compounds were adequately described by a two-compartment model (one compartment for each compound) with first-order elimination. Key covariates included in the final model were age and eGFR. GS-441524 plasma concentrations exceeded the lowest reported half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) with the recommended dosage, and higher dosages exceeded the lowest reported 90%-effective concentration (EC90). Conclusions: The licensed remdesivir dose may achieve target concentrations of GS-441524, but higher dosages may optimise outcomes.

A clinical hepatic impairment (HI) study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of a single oral dose of binimetinib in participants with mild, moderate, and severe HI compared with demographically matched healthy participants with respect to age, gender, and body weight. Methods: Participants were enrolled according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) classification criteria for hepatic function based on their total bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase levels at screening. Participants enrolled into Group 1 (normal hepatic function) were matched to participants enrolled into Groups 2, 3, and 4 (mild, moderate, and severe HI, respectively) with respect to age, gender, and body weight. Dose-normalized PK parameters were evaluated because of a difference in doses for the severe HI group compared to the other groups, with the dose reduction due to the increased exposures observed in the moderate HI group. Results: Among 27 PK evaluable participants, changes in binimetinib dose-normalized PK parameters Cmax/D and AUCinf/D were minimal in participants with mild HI compared to the normal hepatic function group. Both the moderate and severe HI groups had significant changes as AUCinf/D increased by 81% and 111%, respectively, compared to the normal hepatic function group. Unbound AUClast/D for the moderate and severe HI groups increased by 280% and 248% compared to the normal hepatic function group, respectively. Conclusion: Based on these findings on total and unbound exposures, dose reductions are recommended for binimetinib in cancer patients with moderate and severe HI.

In phase II trials, batoclimab resulted in dose-dependent reductions in pathogenic immunoglobulin G autoantibodies; however, dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other lipids were observed. Objective: This study examined the relationship between batoclimab treatment and lipid levels, and whether increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol could be mitigated by coadministration with atorvastatin, a widely used cholesterol-lowering agent. Methods: In this phase I, randomized, fixed-sequence, single-blind trial, 70 healthy participants received subcutaneous injections of batoclimab at various doses or placebo for 6 weeks. Open-label oral atorvastatin was coadministered in a subset of participants receiving batoclimab 340 mg or 680 mg weekly, starting 14 days before the first dose of the study drug, and continuing through the 6-week treatment period and 8-week safety follow-up. Key endpoints included changes in lipid parameters and atorvastatin pharmacokinetics. Results: Dose-dependent increases in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed with batoclimab doses ≥ 255 mg weekly, comparable to previous observations, whereas coadministration of atorvastatin 10 mg or 40 mg daily mitigated these changes. Batoclimab had little effect on atorvastatin pharmacokinetics. Dose-dependent decreases in serum albumin up to 37% were observed with batoclimab doses ≥ 255 mg weekly, returning to near-baseline levels 4 weeks after stopping batoclimab. As expected, coadministration of atorvastatin did not meaningfully impact the albumin level. The majority of adverse events were mild in severity. Conclusions: Atorvastatin can mitigate clinically significant increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that may occur with batoclimab treatment. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003566691,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study encompassed 1535 blood drug concentration observations obtained from 249 children from August 2018 to June 2023. Participants were categorized into four groups (A, B, C, and D) on the basis of their blood concentration levels at various time intervals. The analysis focused on identifying the factors that influenced blood concentration in the short- and long-term posttreatment. The primary endpoint was factors affecting the sirolimus blood concentration. The effect of physiopathological indicators on the corrected blood drug concentration (C/D value) was analyzed to avoid the effect of differences in the dose of SRL used in patients on SRL blood concentrations. The multiple linear regression model was used to examine the impact of factors influencing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics on the C/D. Results: Analysis of SRL blood concentration monitoring indicated that a majority (60.43%) of patients demonstrated a trough sirolimus concentration (C0) below the level of the recommended threshold of 5 ng/mL, while approximately 17.7% of patients exceeded 15 ng/mL. The results indicated a noteworthy association between weight and body surface area (BSA) and the C/D of SRL in groups A, B, and D (P < 0.05). Additionally, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and albumin (ALB) in group A; ALB in group B; and platelet count (PLT) in group C demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with the C/D of SRL (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Clinicians should optimize medication plans by considering the child’s weight, BSA, ALT, AST, PLT, ALB, and relevant factors.

This study demonstrates the development of a 3D MPS with a dual-chamber, closed-capillary circuit microfluidic culture platform to study chemotherapy drug efficacy in vitro for aggressive malignancies such as breast cancer and glioblastoma. This novel microfluidic system was used to model HER2 + breast cancer (BCTM-SKBR3) co-cultured with cardiac (CTM-AC16) tissue for proof-of-concept chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity studies. To further demonstrate the versatility of this system, a glioblastoma tissue model with chemotherapy efficacy studies was included. Additionally, implementation of a Python-based automated image analysis script (AIAPS) facilitated quantification of cell size within the tissue models from 3D fluorescence z-stack images. The results demonstrate maintenance of lineage-specific biomarker expression, physiologically relevant cell morphology and structural organization, and detectable changes in cell sizes with chemotherapy treatment within the 3D tissue models. These results demonstrated the system’s potential for use as a preclinical drug screening platform. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012215773,Cancer drugs; Cardiotoxicity

In this study, we investigated the QD-protein assemblies spontaneously formed with the greener water soluble InP/ZnS–COOH QDs and isolated disease biomarker proteins under various environmental conditions, including QDs size, solution pH, incubation time, ionic strength, different salts, as well as the lowest concentrations of the proteins that started the formation of detectable assemblies. It was shown that higher ionic strength or valence charge disrupted the assembly's formation. The basic pH 8.5 facilitated the formation to a greater extent than the pH 7.4 did. The heat shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90α) adsorbed on QDs surface more readily than cytochrome C (CytoC) and lysozyme (Lyz) in the basic environment. Among the three-sized QDs compared, the medium-sized QDs were the most effective in promoting the assemblies' formation. The detectable assemblies started at as low as 0.4 ng/mL of CytoC, 1.0 ng/mL of HSP90α, or 1.8 ng/mL of Lyz, respectively. The findings add insights into how the biomarker proteins interacted with the QDs under different environmental conditions, which promotes the understanding of QD-protein assemblies' collaborative behaviors when they facilitate bioimaging and biomedicine applications. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005070167,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Current standard approaches for the detection of NPY hypermethylation levels rely on the use of enzymes and are associated with high costs, long times of analysis and interferences from PCR inhibitors, which limits their applicability in point-of-care or low-resource environments. Therefore, the need for an affordable, rapid, and sensitive technology for NPY methylation detection is clear. Results: Herein we present a novel, rapid, sensitive, highly selective, and enzyme-free photoelectrochemical ratiometric bio-platform for the detection and quantification of NPY gene hypermethylation. At the core of this method lies the use of magnetic microbeads and singlet oxygen (1O2)-based photoelectrochemical detection. The use of bisulfite conversion and hybridization temperature allowed to achieve a 99 % discrimination efficiency of the methylated NPY target from the unmethylated one. Detection of 18 pM (18 fmol) of 94-nucleotide methylated NPY target sequence with 6 methylation sites in hybridization buffer and 45 pM (45 fmol) against the background of genomic DNA was achieved without any amplification. Ultimately, ratiometric quantitative sensing of methylated NPY gene over reference albumin gene was carried out and an LOD of 2 % methylation level was obtained. Significance: Overall, this technique demonstrated immense potential in overcoming the complexity, high costs, and need for enzymes of current strategies for hypermethylation detection and thus represents a great innovation in (photo)electrochemical sensing of aberrant DNA methylation. It, therefore, holds great promise for establishing in future a clinically relevant point-of-care testing device. © 2025",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009619708,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

To address potential underdosing of lesions with SIRT, we designed a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04518748) to add stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) 6 weeks after 90Y SIRT. Methods and Materials: In this ongoing, single-center prospective trial, patients received standard-of-care 90Y SIRT with glass microspheres for the treatment of unresectable primary or secondary liver cancer. Post-SIRT dosimetry was performed using 90Y positron emission tomography/computed tomography to calculate mean lesion absorbed doses. Lesions were considered eligible for SBRT treatment if the mean absorbed dose was <290 Gy. In the presence of dose heterogeneity, SBRT gross tumor volumes were optionally limited to subvolumes based on a SIRT dose threshold determined from prior modeling. Interim analysis was prespecified after 10 participants received both SIRT and SBRT and completed 6-month follow-up with the primary endpoint of an increase in Child-Pugh score of ≥2. Results: Of the 24 patients who received SIRT as part of the trial, 15 had lesions that were considered dosimetrically eligible for SBRT based on the criteria of 290 Gy mean absorbed dose from 90Y. Of those, 10 patients received SBRT with prescription doses between 30 and 50 Gy. Only 1 patient had a Child-Pugh increase of ≥2 at 6 months following SBRT, and only 1 grade 3 nonlaboratory toxicity was reported after SBRT. Conclusions: Interim analysis found that liver toxicity from 90Y SIRT followed by SBRT was below the early stopping threshold, and continuation of the study to complete recruitment of 30 evaluable patients was recommended. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005802441,Interim; Internal radiation

TTS has been suggested to be caused by catecholamine excess leading to myocardial inflammation as an additional driver of cardiac damage and impaired outcome. Currently, no evidence-based treatment exists. In a preclinical model of catecholamine-driven TTS, cyclosporine A (CsA) bolus therapy significantly improved outcome, likely mediated via suppression of calcineurin-driven inflammation. The Cyclosporine In Takotsubo syndrome (CIT) trial is a pilot multicenter double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the impact of CsA bolus therapy in patients suffering from acute TTS. Study design and objectives: This RCT is designed to investigate the impact of repetitive CsA bolus therapy vs. placebo in acute high-risk TTS patients with an increased risk of intrahospital complications and long-term mortality. The main goal is to reduce myocardial damage quantified by AUC of a centrally measured high-sensitive cardiac Troponin T (hs-cTnT) over 72 hours (primary endpoint). Therefore, patients with TTS will be randomized 1:1 after angiography and receive an intravenous bolus of 2.5 mg/kg CsA or an equivalent amount of placebo immediately after baseline measurements. At 12 and 24 hours additional doses of the study drug will be applied accumulating to 7.5 mg/kg in the intervention group. After baseline laboratory measurements (including hs-cTnT) and echocardiography (TTE), serum parameters will be measured again at 3 hours and every 12 hours from baseline. TTE imaging will be performed at 24, 48 and 72 hours, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) at 24 to 96 hours. Left ventricular function recovery, myocardial edema (CMR), in-hospital complications, length of hospital stay, 30-day and 1-year composite cardiovascular outcome, as well as Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire self-assessment are included as secondary endpoints. Conclusions: The CIT trial is designed to assess the safety and potential benefit of CsA on hs-cTnT release as an established marker of myocardial injury in high-risk TTS patients. The results of this trial may reveal CsA as a first pathophysiology-driven treatment option of TTS and enable a phase III follow-up trial powered for clinical outcome parameters as primary endpoint.

This study aimed to characterize the relationships of RBCM profiles and anemia types to HF outcomes and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) parameters. Methods: Chronic stable HF patients were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent BVA; a subset underwent supine invasive CPET within 24 hours of BVA. RBCM profiles were defined using RBCM %deviation (deficit: <−10%, normal: −10 to 10%, excess: >10%). Anemia defined by World Health Organization criteria alone was categorized using RBCM %deviation (<−10% true anemia, ≥−10% dilutional pseudo-anemia). HF hospitalization at 6 months and CPET parameters were compared among RBCM profiles and anemia types. Results: One-hundred twenty patients (58 years, 40% female, 41% Black, 63% HFrEF) were enrolled. Forty percent had RBCM deficit, 37.5% had normal RBCM, and 22.5% had excess RBCM. Fifty-eight patients (48%) were anemic: 60% true anemia and 40% dilutional pseudo-anemia. Patients with dilutional pseudo-anemia had a higher incidence of HF hospitalization (44.8%) compared to no anemia (22.7%) and true anemia (20.6%) (P = .040). There was no difference in HF hospitalization among RBCM profiles (P = .99). There was a nonsignificant trend toward worse peak VO2 in RBCM deficit and true anemia, with no differences in other CPET parameters. Conclusions: Dilutional pseudo-anemia demonstrated higher HF hospitalizations compared to true anemia, while true anemia had a trend towards worse peak VO2. The implications of BVA-identified RBCM profiles and anemia types for clinical management warrant further investigation. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005009836,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

STAREE-HEART is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing atorvastatin on markers of cardiovascular aging in a healthy older population. This ancillary study is nested in the STAtins in Reducing Events in the Elderly (STAREE) primary prevention trial. Methods: Participants ≥ 70 years (n = 369) have been randomized to atorvastatin or placebo. Assessment at baseline and 3-years includes echocardiogram, electrocardiography and blood collection for biomarker assessment. The primary endpoint is change in global longitudinal strain (GLS), a measure of left ventricular systolic function. An estimated 184 participants per group enables detection of mean GLS at 3 years in the placebo group being 2.0 percentage points lower than mean GLS in the statin group at 3 years, assuming SD = 5 percentage points and a 15% attrition rate, with power >90%. We present summary statistics describing participants at baseline. Results: The mean age of the 369 STAREE-HEART participants was 73.0 years (SD 3.4). Mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was 64.0% (SD 6.1), and mean GLS was 19.2% (SD 2.2). Mean GLS was similar between females and males (19.4% vs 19.0%) and slightly higher in those aged 70 to 74 compared to ≥75 years (19.4% vs 18.6%). AF was detected on screening in 4.5% of participants. Conclusion: The STAREE-HEART ancillary study will provide mechanistic detail concerning myocardial dysfunction and its consequences, to determine if atorvastatin affects left ventricular systolic function associated with aging.

New methods for peanut allergy diagnosis through bead-based epitope assay (BBEA) testing with Ara h 2.008 and Ara h 2.019 epitopes have retrospectively demonstrated improved accuracy in peanut allergy diagnosis. Objective: To prospectively evaluate BBEA testing for peanut allergy in a real-world racially diverse clinical population with determination of BBEA testing accuracy, PPV, negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity. Methods: Patients from a tertiary food allergy clinic underwent standard testing for peanut allergy, including skin prick testing, specific IgE testing, and evaluation of peanut IgE component (Ara h 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9) testing. BBEA evaluation to the Ara h 2.008 and Ara h 2.019 epitopes was performed on all patients, and oral food challenges were offered to patients with indeterminate standard testing. Results: In this real-world population study, BBEA testing has a 96% accuracy, 96% PPV, 94% NPV, 98% sensitivity, and 89.5% specificity. For children younger than 2 years and Black children, the accuracy, PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity were 100%. The NPV was 100% in patients with no peanut ingestion or reaction history.

Methods: A total of 705 legs with chronic edema, defined as persistent leg edema lasting for > 3 months, were examined in 411 patients who visited our clinic between April 2009 and March 2024. Patients with known systemic edematous conditions or those with serum albumin levels <3.5 g/dL and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, as confirmed during screening blood tests at their initial visits, were excluded from the study. The presence of edema in the leg, including the pedal region, was confirmed using ultrasonography to detect subcutaneous echo-free spaces (SEFS). Routine assessments included blood screening, duplex venous scans, and skin ultrasonography. Air plethysmography, lymphangioscintigraphy, and bioelectrical impedance analysis were performed whenever feasible. Results: The prevalence of PE in legs with chronic edema was 64%. Multivariate analyses identified the severity of SEFS in the lateral lower calf, which correlated with the overall severity of leg edema (odds ratio [OR]: 5.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.46–14.62; P < 0.001), and serum albumin level (OR: 2.55; 95% CI: 1.31–5.05; P < 0.01) as significant risk factors for PE. Conclusion: PE was present in 64% of legs with chronic edema. The primary contributors to PE were the overall severity of leg edema and lower serum albumin levels, even within the normal range. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004295980,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study evaluates the prognostic value of the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI) as a biomarker for predicting restenosis risk in SFA lesions. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, 632 patients undergoing endovascular interventions for symptomatic PAD were analyzed. AISI was calculated as: (neutrophils × platelets × monocytes)/lymphocytes. Patients were divided into 2 groups as those who developed restenosis and those who did not develop restenosis. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent predictors of restenosis. Results: Among 632 patients, 142 developed restenosis. The median AISI was significantly higher in the restenosis group compared to the nonrestenosis group (909.28 vs. 516.59, P < 0.001). Patients with high AISI demonstrated a 2.13-fold increased risk of restenosis (hazard ratio: 2.133, 95% confidence interval: 1.508–3.017, P < 0.001) and a shorter time to restenosis (median: 6 months vs. 12 months). Smoking, presence of prior intervention, intervention types, and stent-graft use were also associated with an elevated risk of restenosis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified an AISI cutoff value of 489.64 (sensitivity: 57%, specificity: 56%, area under the curve: 0.623). Conclusion: AISI is a promising inflammatory biomarker for predicting the risk of restenosis in PAD patients undergoing endovascular treatment of the SFA. Incorporating AISI into clinical practice could enhance risk stratification and guide personalized management strategies. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and further investigate the mechanistic role of systemic inflammation in restenosis development. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010576472,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Bile salts and bilirubin are often implicated in the etiology of pruritus. We evaluated whether these compounds activate known itch receptors. Methods: Activation of the established pruriceptors TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPV3, TRPV4, MRGPRX4 in cells overexpressing these receptors, by monitoring cytosolic free Ca2+. TGR5 activation was assayed by means of cAMP ELISA in TGR5 overexpressing cells. Serum from 43 cholestatic patients and 15 controls was analyzed for receptor activation; plasma bile salt concentrations were quantified by HPLC-MS. Results: Plasma levels of conjugated bile salts and their sulphated and glucuronidated derivatives correlated with pruritus intensity; most unconjugated bile salts did not. TRPA1 and MRGPRX4 were activated by bile salts only at high concentrations. Bilirubin only weakly activated MRGPRX4. However, physiological levels of albumin completely abrogated these activations. Incubation of receptor-expressing cells with patient serum (containing albumin) did not activate any of the itch receptors. In contrast, physiological concentrations of albumin reduced but did not completely abrogate bile salt-induced TGR5 activation, and the extent of this activation correlated with pruritus intensity. However, TGR5 activation was also induced by plasma from NTCP-deficient individuals. Conclusion: While TGR5 activation correlates with pruritus, this receptor was also activated by plasma of NTCP deficient patients who do not suffer from pruritus, indicating that activation of TGR5 is not a dominant factor. The absence of receptor activation in the presence of physiological concentrations of albumin indicates that bile salts and bilirubin do not play a direct role in activation of these receptors. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012941314,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Key regulators of this response in macrophages are the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. This study explored the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin C and AptaminC320 in macrophages. We found that nitric oxide, produced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), was reduced by vitamin C and AptaminC320 in RAW264.7 cells, which are murine macrophages. Furthermore, these substances reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. We also demonstrated that protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), increased by LPS in macrophages, as well as the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38, were reduced by vitamin C and AptaminC320. These findings suggest that vitamin C and AptaminC320 exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by modulating NF-κB and MAPK signaling, suggesting that they offer significant therapeutic potential as safe and effective treatments for inflammatory diseases with minimal side effects in comparison with the commonly used steroidal anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217979335,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

There is growing interest in investigating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), cognition, and other mental health-related disorders. This has created a need for a comprehensive, combined, and easy-to-follow method to isolate serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and hippocampal neurons. The hippocampus, responsible for learning and memory, is affected by various neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, obtaining samples like CSF and hippocampal neurons is challenging, especially from small animals like rats. Currently, there is no efficient method for isolating these samples altogether from a single animal, and its use in downstream applications has not been thoroughly tested. We have developed a comprehensive and streamlined method for isolating serum, CSF, and hippocampal neurons from a single animal, suitable for downstream applications such as proteomics and biomarker research.

The fate of these eluted products and their local distribution in vascular tissue largely under studied. In this study, we employ a high spatial resolution spectrometric imaging modality, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-TOF-MS) to map the metal distribution, (herein refered to as laser ablation mapping, or LAM) from Mg alloys within the mouse vascular system and approximate their local concentrations. We used a novel rare earth element bearing Mg alloy (WE22) wire implanted within the abdominal aorta of transgenic hypercholesterolemic mice (APOE−/−) to simulate a bioabsorbable vascular prosthesis for up to 30 days. We describe qualitatively and semi-quantitatively implant-derived corrosion product presence throughout the tissue cross sections, and their approximate concentrations within the various vessel structures. Additionally, we report the spatial changes of corrosion products, which we postulate are mediated by phagocytic inflammatory cells such as macrophages (MΦ’s). © 2024 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204719389,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Two therapeutic strategies were designed. One utilizes calcium silicate (CS) hydrogel for localized intramuscular treatment, and the other employs CS solution for systemic treatment through Intravenous injection. Both treatments restore silicon levels in the muscles and serum of aging mice, and show therapeutic effects on sarcopenia. Specifically, the CS hydrogel demonstrates more pronounced short-term efficacy in promoting local muscle regeneration, while the CS solution exhibits superior outcomes in modulating the overall condition of aging mice. The fundamental mechanism of the CS treatments on sarcopenia may involve the direct regulation of the SIRTs signaling pathway by silicate ions released from CS, as well as the indirect regulation of SIRTs pathway via the suppression of Sarcolipin (SLN) overexpression by silicate ions. Specifically, silicate ions directly upregulate SIRT1 expression in macrophages and on one side promote NF-kB deacetylation to inhibit M1 polarization, and on the other side facilitate STAT3 deacetylation to inhibit M2 polarization, ultimately reducing the expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6) and fibrotic factors (IL-10, TGF-β). Meanwhile, silicate ions directly upregulate SIRT3 in myoblasts, leading to the promotion of STAT3 dephosphorylation, inhibits mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) secretion, and enhances the expression of MyoD, MyoG, and Myosin, and accelerates myogenic differentiation. This bioactive CS based therapy provides a new approach for combating sarcopenia. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009118085,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Despite extensive research for more than 50 years, physical mechanisms that govern RBC aggregation are still under debate. Two proposed mechanisms are based on bridging and depletion interactions between RBCs due to the presence of macromolecules in blood plasma. The bridging hypothesis assumes the formation of bonds between RBCs through adsorbing macromolecules, while the depletion mechanism results from the exclusion of macromolecules from the intercellular space, leading to effective attraction. Existing experimental studies generally cannot differentiate between these two aggregation mechanisms, although several recent investigations suggest concurrent involvement of the both mechanisms. We explore dynamic aggregation and disaggregation of two RBCs using three simulation models: a potential-based model mimicking depletion interactions, a bridging model with immobile bonds, and a new bridging model with mobile bonds that can slide along RBC membranes. Simulation results indicate that dynamic aggregation of RBCs primarily arises from depletion interactions, while disaggregation of RBCs involves both mechanisms. The bridging model with mobile bonds reproduces well the corresponding experimental data, offering insights into the interplay between bridging and depletion interactions and providing a framework for studying similar interactions between other biological cells. © 2025 Biophysical Society",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002268137,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, detecting subtle amounts of seeds in highly crowded environments remains challenging. Ultrasonication can enhance seed detection by efficiently fragmenting fibrils, but its effects in crowded environments have not been fully explored. In this study, we apply ultrasonication to detect α-Syn seeds in a highly crowded milieu and investigate its effects on seed detection. Our results show that ultrasonication enables rapid detection of α-Syn seeds with a detection limit of 10 pg/mL, even in the presence of 40 mg/mL serum albumin. Intriguingly, the amount of fibril formed depends on the initial seed concentration in a crowded environment only under ultrasonication. To understand this phenomenon, we theoretically analyze the kinetics of seed-dependent amyloid formation. The results suggest that ultrasonic cavitation induces the formation of a dead-end complex between serum albumin and α-Syn monomers, which can reduce false positives by suppressing seed-independent amyloid formation. These findings demonstrate ultrasonication as a powerful tool for the sensitive detection of α-Syn seed in clinical diagnostics. © 2025 Biophysical Society",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008533586,Amyloid (mycology)

Here, zirconium phosphonates chitosan monoliths (ZrPCMs) with varying compositions were constructed through a salt-forming reaction and bidirectional freezing strategy. These composite monoliths exhibited differential coordination abilities for mono- and multi-phosphopeptides without the need for centrifugation or a magnetic field during enrichment process. By the utilization of different ZrPCMs and control of loading amount of sample, selective enrichment of mono- or multi-phosphopeptides was realized. At high loading amounts, excess phosphate groups on ZrPCM-1 inhibited mono-phosphopeptides with chelating with Zr (IV), resulting in the preferential enrichment of multi-phosphopeptides. In contrast, ZrPCM-2 enabled the enrichment of global phosphopeptides due to its balanced phosphate group and Zr(IV) loading, avoiding selective preferences under extreme conditions. At low loading amounts, the availability of sufficient Zr (IV) on ZrPCM-3 facilitated the preferential enrichment of mono-phosphopeptides due to their lower steric hindrance and more stable binding, while the adsorption ability for multi-phosphopeptides was reduced owing to local charge accumulation effects and electrostatic repulsion. These results were verified not only in standard protein but also in complex biological samples involving nonfat milk and mouse liver. Consequently, this present work developed promising ZrPCMs materials and isolation strategy of mono-, multi-, or global phosphopeptides for phosphoproteome research. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007079896,Monolith; Phosphopeptide

However, studies on risk factors related to trazodone plasma concentrations that exceed laboratory alert levels are lacking. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing the trazodone plasma concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio in the Chinese population. Additionally, it attempted to comprehensively investigate the factors contributing to trazodone concentrations exceeding 1200 ng/mL. Methods: A single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted at Xi'an Mental Health Center in China, where data on Trazodone-treated patients between 2020 and 2023 were collected. Results: The C/D ratios of trazodone were significantly influenced by age, the formulations of trazodone, and the concomitant use of fluvoxamine. Additionally, the results revealed that 21.67 % of patients receiving daily trazodone doses of 25–200 mg demonstrated plasma concentrations exceeding laboratory alert levels. A logistic regression analysis using a enter method determined patient older age [1.04 (95 CI: 1.01–1.07)], higher daily dose [1.04 (95 CI: 1.02–1.05)], higher total protein level [1.10 (95 CI: 1.02–1.19)] and concomitant use of fluvoxamine [7.99 (95 CI: 2.48–25.72)] as risk factors for surpassing laboratory alert levels in plasma concentrations.

In this study, bioglass and bioceramics composed of CaO, SiO2, P2O5, and Na2O were synthesized via the sol-gel method and characterized to assess their structural, chemical, and thermal properties. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed their amorphous nature, while Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy identified key functional groups (Si–O–Si, P–O) crucial for bioactivity. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) determined the degradation temperature up to 700 °C. The synthesized materials were employed as drug delivery matrices for ciprofloxacin (CIP), amoxicillin, and levofloxacin. Levofloxacin exhibited the highest drug-loading capacity (0.75 %), while drug release studies in simulated body fluid (SBF) indicated sustained release, with ciprofloxacin achieving 30 % release and levofloxacin 70 %. Bioceramics exhibited lower drug-loading efficiency compared to bioglass, demonstrating reduced effectiveness as a biomaterial. Among powdered samples, amoxicillin showed 10 % incorporation, with bioglass facilitating the highest release. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Gram-positive (S. aureus, B. cereus, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative (E. coli, S. abony), and fungal (C. albicans) strains. Ciprofloxacin-loaded bioglass exhibited superior efficacy, with a maximum inhibition zone of 33.5 ± 1.32 mm against S. abony, highlighting its potential for antibacterial applications. These findings establish sol-gel-derived bioglass as an efficient platform for controlled drug delivery and antimicrobial therapy. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004591774,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: From 2009 to 2020, 1759 patients with DeBakey I AAD who underwent frozen elephant trunk and total arch replacement surgery at a tertiary centre were divided into preoperative malperfusion (viscera, spinal cord, or lower extremities) and nonmalperfusion subgroups. The baseline differences were balanced with the use of propensity score matching. Prognoses were compared between those who were subjected to high-MHCA (nasopharyngeal temperature 24.1-28.0°C) and low-MHCA (nasopharyngeal temperature 20.1-24.0°C). Results: In the nonmalperfusion subgroup (n = 1389), 469 pairs of matched patients showed lower in-hospital mortality and incidence of acute kidney injury in the high-MHCA group than in the low-MHCA group: in-hospital mortality 7.0% vs 10.2% (P = 0.01); acute kidney injury, 57.1% vs 64.6% (P < 0.01). The duration of mechanical ventilation was shorter in the high-MHCA group than that in the low-MHCA group (P = 0.03). No significant difference in the incidence of paraplegia was observed between the 2 groups. In the malperfusion subgroup (n = 370), 112 pairs of matched patients showed a higher incidence of paraplegia in the high-MHCA group than in the low-MHCA group (15.9% vs 6.5%; P = 0.04). Conclusions: The safety of high-MHCA, a commonly used temperature management strategy during aortic arch surgery, was recognised in most patients with DeBakey I AAD. However, among patients with preoperative distal organ malperfusion, low-MHCA may be more appropriate owing to an increased risk of postoperative paraplegia associated with high-MHCA. © 2024 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200822201,Elephant trunks; Paraplegia

Methods: Fifty-one singleton fetuses diagnosed with RVH and 51 normal fetuses were retrospectively included. LV global longitudinal strain and global circumferential strain were acquired using 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Fraction anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and helix angle were measured using diffusion tensor cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in 4 fetal specimens with RVH and 3 normal fetal specimens. Bioinformatics analysis was performed for differentially expressed proteins between RVH and normal specimens. Results: In RVH fetuses, LV global longitudinal strain and regional longitudinal strain were significantly lower than in controls (P < 0.001), whereas LV sphericity index and LV global circumferential strain were increased. In RVH fetuses, fraction anisotropy was higher in middle and apical segments than in normal fetuses (P < 0.001). LV mean diffusivity was reduced in all of the segments (P < 0.001). Circumferentially oriented myocytes and left-handed oriented myocytes were increased, but right-handed oriented myocytes were decreased (P < 0.001). Using proteomics, 95 myocardial proteins differed with upregulation of 66 and downregulation in RVH hearts including myocardial contractile fibrillar proteins and cell membrane protein complexes. Conclusions: In fetal RVH, the left ventricle demonstrates altered function with reduced longitudinal but augmented circumferential strain, which might support its need to augment its preload and consequent cardiac output. Decreased right-handed and increased circumferentially oriented myocytes might contribute to this adaptation. The left ventricle in fetal RVH also demonstrates a differential expression of various myocardial proteins. © 2024 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216664727,Ventricular Function

Cardiac accumulation leads to left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis, and sudden cardiac death. Advances in transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) have enabled the detection of subclinical atrial and ventricular cardiomyopathy. Until now, studies assessing changes on TTE in FD have been small and cross-sectional. To understand longitudinal changes, our aim was to quantify trends in TTE parameters, linked to relevant physiological and biochemical parameters. Methods: A single-centre retrospective study was conducted of 75 FD patients who received longitudinal follow-up care (53% female, 57% on enzyme replacement therapy) between 2011 and 2023. Results: Longitudinal follow-up care demonstrated increasingly impaired left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), tissue Doppler imaging, and right ventricular systolic function. Atrial changes included increasingly impaired left atrial GLS, greater volumes, and reduced left atrial ejection fraction and fractional area change. A sex-specific increase occurred in indexed left ventricular mass in male patients. Biochemical changes included increases in high-sensitivity Troponin-T and N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. A sex-specific increase in the urine protein level and the albumin-creatinine ratio in male patients. Conclusions: TTE and biochemical trends highlight the gradual and insidious nature of FD progression, and stress the importance of considering multiparametric endpoints, including GLS, atrial function, and biomarkers, when assessing outcome in FD. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219080394,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: Data from 480 trough tacrolimus concentrations in 86 cSLE patients over five years were analyzed. A nonlinear mixed-effects model was constructed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus. We screened 27 machine learning and deep learning models using 29 clinical variables to select the best-performing individualized dose prediction model. To further enhance prediction accuracy, the pharmacokinetic parameters were subsequently embedded within the optimized model. Model performance was assessed through the utilization of goodness-of-fit plots and diagnostic parameters such as objective function values and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Results: The pharmacokinetic profile of tacrolimus was best accurately characterized by a one-compartment model, which incorporated first-order kinetics for both absorption and elimination processes. The typical estimates for apparent clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) were 3.52 L/h/70 kg and 124.84 L/70 kg, respectively. Among the 27 machine learning models, the XGBoost algorithm demonstrated the best prediction accuracy for tacrolimus dose (R2 = 0.74, mean absolute error [MAE] = 0.016, mean square error [MSE] = 0.0005). After incorporating 11 key variables, including pharmacokinetic parameters (CL/F and V/F), into the model and performing hyperparameter turning, prediction accuracy significantly enhanced (R2 = 0.80, MAE = 0.013, MSE = 0.0004). Two cSLE patients who received model-predicted doses achieved disease activity indexes ≤4 after treatment. Conclusion: This study successfully developed an accurate machine learning-based model for predicting individualized tacrolimus dosing in cSLE patients. The integration of pharmacokinetic parameters significantly enhanced the model's accuracy, improving dosing precision and reducing overexposure, thus enhancing therapeutic efficacy. © 2025",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010921975,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
