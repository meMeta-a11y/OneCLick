Objective: To investigate the frequency and predictors of serum potassium level greater than 5.5 mmol/L and less than 3.5 mmol/L and examine the treatment effect associated with finerenone, relative to placebo, on clinical outcomes based on postrandomization potassium levels. Design, Setting, and Participants: Secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF multicenter, randomized clinical trial, performed between September 14, 2020, and January 10, 2023, with a median follow-up of 32 months (final date of follow-up: June 14, 2024). Patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40%, New York Heart Association class II to IV symptoms, and elevated natriuretic peptides were included. Intervention: Participants received finerenone or placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of total worsening heart failure events or cardiovascular death. Results: A total of 6001 participants were included (3003 randomized to receive finerenone and 2998 randomized to receive placebo). The increase in serum potassium was greater in the finerenone group than the placebo group at 1 month (median [IQR] difference, 0.19 [0.17-0.21] mmol/L) and 3 months (median [IQR] difference, 0.23 [0.21-0.25] mmol/L), which persisted for the remainder of trial follow-up. Finerenone increased the risks of potassium level increasing to greater than 5.5 mmol/L (hazard ratio [HR], 2.16 [95% CI, 1.83-2.56]; P <.001) and decreased the risks for potassium level decreasing to less than 3.5 mmol/L (HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.38-0.56]; P <.001). Both low (< 3.5 mmol/L; HR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.8-3.43]) and high (>5.5 mmol/L; HR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.04-2.58]) potassium levels were associated with higher subsequent risks of the primary outcome in both treatment groups. Nevertheless, the risk of the primary outcome was generally lower in patients treated with finerenone compared with placebo, even in those whose potassium level increased to greater than 5.5 mmol/L. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, finerenone resulted in more frequent hyperkalemia and less frequent hypokalemia. However, with protocol-directed surveillance and dose adjustment, clinical benefit associated with finerenone relative to placebo was maintained even in those whose potassium level increased to greater than 5.5 mmol/L.

Wang P.; Gao X.; Willett W.C.; Giovannucci E.L.,"Socioeconomic Status, Diet, and Behavioral Factors and Cardiometabolic Diseases and Mortality",2024,JAMA Network Open,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.51837,"Importance: It remains unclear how socioeconomic status (SES) is related to the association between diet and health, as well as the role of behavioral factors, in explaining socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes. Objective: To investigate the associations of neighborhood and individual SES factors, as well as behavioral factors, particularly dietary pattern, with health outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included US health professionals without chronic diseases at baseline who were enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (calendar years 1988-2018), the Nurses' Health Study (calendar years 1992-2018), and the Nurses' Health Study II (calendar years 2001-2019). Data analysis was performed in September 2023. Exposures: Repeated questionnaires were used to assess neighborhood and individual SES factors and behavioral factors, including dietary pattern (assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010), alcohol intake, body mass index, cigarette smoking, physical activity, sedentary television-viewing time, and sleep duration. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were incident major cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and total mortality. The associations of SES and behavioral factors with outcomes were analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models with hazard ratios (HRs) per 10th- to 90th-percentile increments. Results: The study analyzed 152192 participants for major CVD (mean [SD] age, 52.0 [8.7] years; 125 959 female [82.8%]), 151217 participants for T2D (mean [SD] age, 52.0 [8.6] years; 125 231 female [82.8%]), and 141145 participants for mortality (mean [SD] age, 51.6 [8.5] years; 117 627 female [83.3%]). A healthy dietary pattern was inversely associated with risk for major CVD (HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82-0.93]), T2D (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.75-0.84]), and total mortality (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.81-0.88]). Without adjusting for neighborhood and individual SES factors, the HRs were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80-0.91) for risk for major CVD, 0.78 (95% CI, 0.74-0.82) for T2D, and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.85) for total mortality. Neighborhood SES was inversely associated with risk for major CVD (HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.85-0.95]), T2D (HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.88-0.97]), and total mortality (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.94]). Behavioral factors accounted for a large proportion of the associations with risk for major CVD (46.3% [95% CI, 32.5%-60.6%]), T2D (77.4% [95% CI, 64.5%-86.6%]), and total mortality (42.8% [95% CI, 32.9%-53.3%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospective cohort study of health professionals, associations between diet and health outcomes remained similar without adjusting for SES factors, while health behaviors, including diet, accounted for a large proportion of the associations between neighborhood SES and health. These findings highlight the importance of health behaviors, particularly high-quality diets, in promoting individual health and possibly reducing health disparities associated with SES.  © 2024Wang P et al.

Berning P.; Adhikari R.; Schroer A.E.; Jelwan Y.A.; Razavi A.C.; Blaha M.J.; Dzaye O.,Longitudinal Analysis of Obesity Drug Use and Public Awareness,2025,JAMA Network Open,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.57232,"Importance: Obesity, a chronic disease with escalating global prevalence, poses considerable health risks. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), including liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, have demonstrated efficacy for weight loss in clinical trials. The paradigm shift in the approach to obesity management drugs (OMDs) may offer an opportunity to examine online search activity and prescription trends. Objective: To investigate prescription patterns and online search trends for OMD and correlating usage dynamics with public engagement regarding these medications. Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated cross-sectional study analyzed online searches and corresponding data for dispensed prescriptions derived from the IQVIA National Prescription Audit, a comprehensive audit capturing approximately 90% of US retail prescription dispensing that is then projected to population-level data. Data from online searches and on prescriptions from the National Prescription Audit for US Food and Drug Administration-approved OMDs were collected from July 1, 2017, through February 29, 2024. This population-level analysis included all eligible individuals using either the Google search engine or receiving prescriptions. Exposures: US monthly query fractions as online searches per 10 million total searches and monthly prescriptions dispensed for OMDs. Main Outcome and Measures: Trends in OMD prescriptions and online searches were visually analyzed, and quantitative correlations were calculated using Spearman rank correlation. Results: During the study period, 69 213 936 prescriptions for OMDs were dispensed in the US, with an overall increase of 0.76 to 0.80 million from July 2017 to June 2018 and 1.29 to 1.51 million from March 2023 to February 2024 and a mean (SD) annual growth rate of 5.3% (9.4%). Total monthly OMD prescriptions reached 1.5 million in February 2024, accounting for 0.41% of all prescriptions that month. Phentermine, semaglutide (Wegovy; Novo Nordisk), liraglutide (Saxenda; Novo Nordisk), and tirzepatide (Zepbound; Eli Lilly) were most prescribed. By February 2024, phentermine had approximately 0.74 million monthly prescriptions, Wegovy had 0.42 million, and Zepbound had 0.25 million. Most prescriptions were issued by advanced practice practitioners (APP) and primary care physicians (PCPs) and internists. The APPs' share increased from 25.3% in July 2017 to 40.6% in February 2024, while PCPs' and internists' share decreased from 57.9% to 48.1%. Wegovy's share of total OMDs increased to 27.7% and 28.3% and Zepbound's share to 16.1% and 16.5% (both February 2024) among APPs and PCPs and internists, respectively. Phentermine's dropped from 86.3% and 85.1% (July 2017) to 50.8% and 49.7% (February 2024), respectively. Online searches per 10 million reflected prescription trends, with Wegovy at 636.3, Zepbound at 468.9, and phentermine at 301.8 (all February 2024). The strongest correlations between prescriptions and search volumes were observed for semaglutide (Wegovy; r = 0.97) and tirzepatide (Zepbound; r = 0.90). Conclusions and Relevance: This repeated cross-sectional study shows the dynamic growth and evolving share of new obesity medications since 2017 and a significant shift toward semaglutide and tirzepatide prescribing. The joint surge in prescriptions and online searches and their close correlation highlight the real-time associations between public awareness and prescription trends.  © 2025 Berning P et al.

Objective: To assess the association between successful direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment and the risk of EHMs in individuals with chronic HCV infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based retrospective cohort study used data from 1990 to 2021, with a median follow-up of 2.5 years for outcome assessment. People treated with DAAs were matched to those who were never treated by year of HCV diagnosis and inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were estimated to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics between treated and untreated people. The study took place in British Columbia, Canada, using the BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort, which includes more than 1300000 people tested for HCV between 1990 to 2015. Data were analyzed from February 2024 to March 2025. Exposure: Successful HCV treatment with DAAs, defined as achieving sustained virologic response (SVR). Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of 5 groups of EHMs: chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease (CKD and ESKD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), stroke, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and neurocognitive disorders (NCD). Results: Of 22576 individuals included in this study (mean [SD] age at HCV diagnosis, 42.0 [12.0] years; 14950 male [66.2%]), 11953 received DAA treatment and achieved SVR, 386 received treatment but did not achieve SVR, and 10237 never received treatment. The incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) in untreated vs treated with SVR groups were: 21.0 (95% CI, 19.0-23.1) vs 14.7 (95% CI, 13.4-16.1) for CKD and ESKD, 8.9 (95% CI, 7.7-10.2) vs 6.3 (95% CI, 5.5-7.2) for stroke, 26.7 (95% CI, 24.5- 29.1) vs 19.3 (95% CI, 17.8-20.9) for MACE, 19.2 (95% CI, 17.3-21.2) vs 10.3 (95% CI, 9.2-11.5) for NCD, and 6.4 (95% CI, 5.4-7.7) vs 9.2 (95% CI, 8.1-10.4) for T2D. In multivariable IPTW-weighted regression models, successful DAA treatment was associated with lower risk of CKD and ESKD (adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio [acsHR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47-0.63), stroke (acsHR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54-0.81), MACE (acsHR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.52-0.66), and NCD (acsHR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.45-0.61) compared with no treatment. However, no significant association was found for T2D (acsHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.84-1.29). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of 22576 individuals with chronic HCV infection, successful HCV treatment with DAAs was associated with lower risk of several EHMs. These findings highlight the importance of early HCV screening and treatment to prevent EHMs and improve overall health outcomes. © 2025 American Medical Association.

Objective: To estimate the association between stable vs unstable housing and type 2 diabetes outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed electronic health record data of adults with type 2 diabetes from US community-based health centers from June 2016 to April 2023. Targeted minimum loss estimation was used to examine the association between having vs not having housing instability and subsequent type 2 diabetes outcomes, adjusting for age, date of housing instability assessment, sex, race and ethnicity (social constructs that may indicate the experience of racism), language, comorbidities, health insurance, income, and census-tract level social vulnerability index. Analyses were conducted from July 2023 to September 2024. Exposure: Report of housing stability or instability. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The primary time point was 12 months after initial assessment, with secondary time points at 6, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months. Results: A total of 90 233 individuals were included (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [13.7] years; 50 772 female [56.3%]; 25 602 Black [28.4%], 27 277 Hispanic [31.4%], 51 720 White [57.3%]); 28 784 individuals (31.9%) had a primary language other than English, and 15 713 (17.4%) reported housing instability. Prior to first housing instability assessment, mean (SD) HbA1c was 7.64% (1.94%), mean (SD) SBP was 130.0 (13.5) mm Hg, mean (SD) DBP was 78.2 (7.8) mm Hg, and mean (SD) LDL cholesterol was 101.1 (35.2) mg/dL. We estimated had all individuals experienced stable housing, compared with unstable housing, mean HbA1c would have been 0.12% lower (95% CI, -0.16% to -0.07%; P < .001), SBP would have been 0.77 mm Hg lower (95% CI, -1.14 mm Hg to -0.39 mm Hg; P < .001), and DBP 0.27 mm Hg lower (95% CI, -0.49 mm Hg to -0.06 mm Hg; P = .01), but LDL cholesterol would not have been lower (estimated difference, -1.46 mg/dL, 95% CI, -2.96 mg/dL to 0.03 mg/dL; P = .05) at 12 months, with numerically similar results at other time points. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, housing stability was associated with small differences in type 2 diabetes outcomes; combining housing stability interventions with other diabetes interventions may be needed to improve type 2 diabetes outcomes more substantially.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003513213,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: This was case-crossover study on consecutive patients who received a diagnosis of GCA in three hospitals in northern Italy between 2013 and 2021. The PM10 hourly and daily average concentrations, collected in the Italian monitoring network and archived by Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale, were determined using European reference. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to determine patients’ daily exposures to them. We employed conditional logistic regression to estimate the effect of exposure on GCA symptoms onset or ischemic complications. Results: We included 232 patients. A positive association was observed between exposure to PM10 and GCA risk, with an incremental odd of 27.1% (95% confidence interval 5.8–52.6) for every 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration within a 60-day period. We did not find any significant association for shorter periods or with ischemic complications. Subgroup analysis found a significantly higher incremental risk at a 60-day lag for patients ≥70 years old. Comparing patients who were chronically exposed to high PM10 levels (26.9 ± 13.8 μg/m3) to those who were not (11.9 ± 7.9 μg/m3) revealed that only in the former group was there an association between GCA onset and increased PM10 levels in the preceding 60 days. Conclusion: Exposure to environmental PM10 in the preceding 60 days seems to be associated with an increased risk of developing GCA, especially in older individuals with prolonged exposure to high levels of air pollution. © 2024 American College of Rheumatology.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201003595,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Lu P.; Tsang T.; Badowski M.S.; Pennington M.E.; Meade-Tollin L.C.,Evaluation of the Clinical Safety of the Low-Cost Warburg Therapy for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Cancers,2024,Cancer Medicine,10.1002/cam4.70469,"Background: Rising cancer care costs are becoming cost prohibitive for lower income people worldwide. We developed the Warburg protocol as a low-cost option for the treatment of cancer that was inspired. It was developed to exploit an Achilles heel which is a hallmark of cancer cells; the metabolic requirement for higher levels of glucose than normal cells. Objective: The purpose of this report is to assess the clinical safety and affordability of the Warburg therapy as an option for patients with advanced cancers. Methods: Between 2021 and 2023, 251 patients with advanced cancers received a total of 8542 treatments with the Warburg therapy. To restrict the supply of blood glucose to cancerous tumors, regular human insulin was administered (IV) sufficient to reduce blood glucose concentrations to hypoglycemic levels for 40–60 min. Subroutine doses of fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide were administered intravenously during this hypoglycemic period. Food or intravenous glucose was given as needed to return blood glucose to euglycemic levels after treatment. Patient symptoms, status, vitals, blood glucose, and hypoglycemic symptoms were monitored throughout treatment. Various blood parameters were measured before and after patients' course of treatment. Results: There were no irreversible adverse reactions in advanced tumor patients of different ages and different cancer types after treatment. There was no significant fluctuation in blood glucose levels in diabetic and non-diabetic patients after treatment, and the weight, vital index and blood biochemical index of patients before and after multiple treatments exhibited little variation. Conclusion: Warburg therapy for the treatment of advanced tumors is clinically feasible, and safe for multiple treatments. It is inexpensive and widely applicable to different patient groups. © 2024 The Author(s).

Wang W.; Huang Y.; Shen J.; Jin L.; Chen Z.,"Associations Between Serum IL-17A, Renal Function and Diabetic Retinopathy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Evidence From a Chinese Han Population",2025,"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism",10.1002/edm2.70033,"Background: Evidence suggested that IL-17A was associated with renal function in type 2 diabetes. We used ultra-sensitive measurement to detect the concentration of IL-17A in human peripheral blood and explored the association of IL-17A with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Methods: We recruited 138 participants from the Shanghai Diabetes Institute Inpatient Database of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital. Eighty-four individuals diagnosed as DKD were cases, and 54 type 2 diabetes individuals without DKD or diabetic retinopathy (DR) were controls. The concentration of serum IL-17A was detected by the High Sensitivity Immunoassay Quantitative Kit. Data was analysed by SAS. Results: The concentration of serum IL-17A in our population ranged from 0.07 pg/mL to 2.96 pg/mL with the median of 0.502 pg/mL. Our results suggested that the level of serum IL-17A in DKD case group was higher than in the control (P unadjusted = 0.0496, P adjusted = 0.0298). And serum creatinine, eGFR, ACR were used as indicators of renal function. Serum creatinine and ACR were positive correlated with the level of serum IL-17A (P adjusted = 0.0148; P adjusted = 0.0369), while eGFR showed a negative correlation (P adjusted = 0.0167). Additionally, the level of serum IL-17A was also significantly higher in DR case group compared with the control group (p = 0.0224). Conclusion: Serum IL-17A level is associated with renal function decline and diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes in a Chinese Han population. Our results suggested that IL-17A may be a potential biomarker of DKD and DR. © 2025 The Author(s).

Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis of the multicenter Mass General Brigham health care system (Boston, Massachusetts) spanning 2018 to 2022, adults eligible for AOMs (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or BMI 27–29.9 kg/m2 with ≥1 ORC) were identified. Among those AOM-eligible, the prevalence of prescriptions for AOMs approved for long-term weight management was evaluated. Results: Of 2,469,474 adults (mean [SD], age 53 [19] years; 57% female; BMI 28.1 [6.3] kg/m2), a total of 1,110,251 (45.0%) were eligible for AOMs. Of these, 69.4% (31.2% of overall cohort) had BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. AOM prescription was observed in 15,214 (1.4%) of all eligible patients, with female sex, younger age, higher BMI, commercial insurance, and greater ORC burden associated with higher prevalence of AOM prescriptions. Musculoskeletal disorders (54%) were the most common ORCs, with ≥2 ORCs observed in 62% of patients. Liraglutide 3.0 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg were the most frequently prescribed AOMs (58% and 34% of all AOMs, respectively). Conclusions: Although nearly one-half of all patients in a large health care system were AOM-eligible by guidelines and regulatory labeling, only 1% of those who were eligible were prescribed AOMs. © 2024 The Author(s).

Qu H.; Zhou L.; Wang J.; Tang D.; Zhang Q.; Shi J.,Iron overload is closely associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetes,2025,Obesity,10.1002/oby.24236,"Objective: The relationship between iron metabolism disturbances and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the association of iron overload with MAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: This study included 155 Chinese inpatients with T2DM. MAFLD was diagnosed and grouped using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI biomarkers such as proton density fat fraction and iron accumulation ((Formula presented.)) were measured. Their clinical characteristics were compared, and the association of iron metabolism markers with MAFLD in patients with T2DM was analyzed. Results: Iron metabolism markers, including MRI- (Formula presented.), ferritin, serum iron, hepcidin, and total iron-binding capacity, were overloaded in groups with MAFLD (p < 0.001 for trend). They were positively correlated with MAFLD and reflected the severity of MAFLD. The five markers of logistic regression analysis revealed an increased MAFLD risk (p < 0.001 for trend). The areas under the curve of five markers all exceeded 0.5, indicating certain predictive values for MAFLD. Conclusions: MAFLD is associated with significant iron overload in Chinese patients with T2DM. Serum iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity, hepcidin, and (Formula presented.) value are essential iron metabolism markers to evaluate and predict the progression of MAFLD in patients with T2DM. © 2025 The Author(s).

Current screening focuses on identifying islet autoantibody positivity, with proposed optimal testing at ages 2, 6 and 10 years potentially achieving up to 80% sensitivity. However, challenges arise from participation rates and costs associated with multiple screenings. Genetic pre-screening has been suggested as a complementary strategy to target high-risk individuals prior to autoantibody testing, but its real-world benefits remain uncertain. Broad genetic selection strategies, based on family history, HLA typing or polygenic risk scores, can identify subsets of the population at elevated risk. However, these approaches face issues like low recall rates, socioeconomic biases and limited applicability across diverse ancestries. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness and infrastructure requirements of integrating genetic testing into routine healthcare remain significant hurdles. The combined use of genetic and autoantibody testing could improve predictive value, especially with innovations like point-of-care genetic testing. Yet, the ultimate success of any screening programme depends less on specific strategies and more on maximising public and healthcare-provider engagement, ensuring high participation, and addressing socioeconomic and demographic disparities. Digital-health infrastructure may play a crucial role in improving recall rates and maintaining follow-up adherence. In conclusion, while repeated islet autoantibody screening remains the most effective standalone approach, conducting genetic screening prior to islet autoantibody testing may be practical in certain contexts, provided that sufficient resources and equitable strategies are employed. Public engagement and robust infrastructure are essential to realising the full potential of early type 1 diabetes detection programmes. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000818913,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Additionally, type 2 diabetes mellitus, a non-communicable disease, is affecting one-tenth of the people worldwide. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between ultra-processed food consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in different scenarios in a prospective cohort study in the western part of Iran. Methods: The RaNCD cohort includes 10,047 participants aged 35 to 65; we included participants susceptible to diabetes at enrolment with follow-up data. We used the widely accepted Nova classification to define ultra-processed foods. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used as the main model; furthermore, the Cox model with different adjustments and the logistic regression model were used as sensitive analysis to evaluate the association between ultra-processed foods consumption and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results: A total of 8827 participants with a mean age of 46.92y, a mean follow-up time of 7.1y, and a mean daily ultra-processed food intake of 87.69 g were included. During the follow-up phases, we included 255 incidences of type 2 diabetes mellitus cases. After adjusting for confounders in the primary model, including age, gender, residence type, socioeconomic status, physical activity, body mass index, and familial history of diabetes despite the elevated hazard ratio of 1.08 (0.75, 1.55) in the fourth quartile compared to the first quartile, the P-value was insignificant (p-value = 0.665); p for trend in the UPF quartiles was also insignificant. Conclusion: Our study has shed light on the association between ultra-processed food consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm or refute the UPFs/T2DM association. © Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205912361,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Le H.; Sindahl P.; Andersen M.; Hallgreen C.E.,Understanding the Work of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC): A Quantitative Review of the Post-Authorisation Safety Evaluation of Antidiabetic Drugs from 2012 to 2022,2025,Drug Safety,10.1007/s40264-025-01536-7,"Background: The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) plays a central role in the European Union’s pharmacovigilance system, evaluating drug safety through several procedures and activities. Despite its central role, few studies have quantitatively investigated the PRAC’s activities from a system’s perspective. Objective: This study aims to map PRAC’s evaluation of safety signals and concerns using antidiabetic products as a case. It characterises the drugs and adverse events involved, analyses the PRAC-led regulatory procedures where the safety signals and concerns were evaluated, and provides a comprehensive review of PRAC meeting minutes. Methods: From PRAC meeting minutes, we retrieved information on all antidiabetic drug-related adverse events discussed from 2012 to 2022. We identified drug-adverse event evaluations based on the discussion content. These were described by drug classes, System Organ Classes, PRAC procedures, and the evaluation outcomes corresponding to recommendations for regulatory actions. We also analysed the sequence of PRAC-led procedures and activities addressing drug-adverse event pairs across meeting minutes. Results: A total of 321 drug-adverse event pairs were identified, with 14 pairs associated with drug classes. Second-generation antidiabetic agents, including sodium-glucose transport protein-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, were the most frequently discussed. Of these, 62 pairs underwent multiple evaluations, resulting in a total of 413 evaluations. In 48% of evaluations, no regulatory action was required. Most evaluations (97%) were concluded in a single procedure, and 66% were concluded in one meeting. Periodic safety update reports accounted for 54% of drug-adverse event evaluations and updates to product information were the most frequent outcome. Signal assessment and prioritisation procedures, while less common, resulted in more diverse recommendations for regulatory action. Referrals were infrequent (N = 5) and were often triggered by the signal assessment and prioritisation procedure. Conclusions: Periodic safety update reports are the primary source for PRAC evaluations of safety signals although they are not intended for notification of new urgent safety information. Compared with periodic safety update reports, the signal assessment and prioritisation procedure evaluates fewer signals but leads to a wider range of regulatory actions, from risk minimisation measures to referrals. This difference may be attributed to the fact that signals detected in periodic safety update reports are not intended for urgent safety issues, these should be assessed through the signal assessment and prioritisation procedure, as the latter involves real-time signal management, whereas the periodic safety update reports are conducted at predefined intervals. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219011113,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Investigating viral interactions of human proteins may reveal mechanisms underlying these effects and offer insights for therapeutic interventions. This study explores molecular interactions of virus and human proteins that may be related to neuropsychiatric disorders. Methods: Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Influenza A virus (IAV) (H1N1, H5N1), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV1&2) were selected as key viruses. Protein structures for each virus were accessed from the Protein Data Bank and analyzed using the HMI-Pred web server to detect interface mimicry between viral and human proteins. The PANTHER classification system was used to categorize viral-human protein interactions based on function and cellular localization. Results: Energetically favorable viral-human protein interactions were identified for HSV-1 (467), CMV (514), EBV (495), H1N1 (3331), H5N1 (3533), and HIV 1&2 (62425). Besides immune and apoptosis-related pathways, key neurodegenerative pathways, including those associated with Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, were frequently interacted. A total of 38 human proteins, including calmodulin 2, Ras-related botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), PDGF-β, and vimentin, were found to interact with all six viruses. Conclusion: The study indicates a substantial number of energetically favorable interactions between human proteins and selected viral proteins, underscoring the complexity and breadth of viral strategies to hijack host cellular mechanisms. Further in vivo and in vitro validation is required to understand the implications of these interactions. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218681362,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study assessed emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations and factors associated with these outcomes following ANOCA and stable angina (SA) with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnoses. Methods: A retrospective cohort of individuals who had their first invasive cardiac catheterization for chest pain in Alberta from 2002 to 2017 was extracted retrospectively from the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH) database. Incidence rates (IRs) were calculated for ED visits and hospitalizations, while factors associated with these outcomes were analyzed using Cox models. Results: Our analysis included 28,881 individuals (ANOCA, 36%). Two-year postcatheterization IRs of ED visits were 100.3-119.3 per 1,000 person-years for ANOCA and increased over time (unstandardized beta coefficient [b] = 2.19 per biennium [95% CI 0.83-3.55]; P = .008); for SA with obstructive CAD the IRs were 209.3-240.2 per 1,000 person-years and remained stable (b = −1.83 per biennium [95% CI −5.73 to 1.70]; P = .25). IRs of hospitalizations were 12.4-25.8 per 1,000 person-years and stable for ANOCA (b = −0.93 per biennium [95% CI −2.49 to 0.64]; P = .20); for SA with obstructive CAD, they were 106.4-171.4 per 1,000 person-years and decreased over time (b = −9.02 per biennium [95% CI −13.27 to −4.77; P = .002). A previous history of heart failure was most associated with ED visits (HR = 1.74 [95% CI 1.41-2.14]; P < .001) and hospitalizations (HR = 2.40 [95% CI 1.82-3.18]; P < .001) for ANOCA. Conclusions: ED visits for ANOCA have risen over time while hospitalizations remain stable, indicating a growing burden despite generally lower rates than SA with obstructive CAD. These findings underscore the need for more effective management strategies to address the significant morbidity and resource utilization in ANOCA. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000438132,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis using data from adults aged 18–35 years enrolled in the All of Us Research Program. Exposures included loneliness, social support, discrimination, neighborhood social cohesion, and stress, measured by standardized surveys. The main outcome was type 2 diabetes or prediabetes by self-report or linked health record. Logistic regression determined the odds of type 2 diabetes/prediabetes for each survey measure, adjusting for age, sex, race or ethnicity, income, and family history. Latent class analysis evaluated clustering of social experiences. Data were collected from 2018 to 2022 and analyzed in May 2023–June 2024. Results: The cohort included 14,217 young adults (aged 28.2 ± 4.4 years, 73.1% [n=10,391] women, 64.1% [n=9,111] White, 10.6% [n=1,506] Hispanic, 5.7% [n=806] Black, and 9.1% [n=1,299] multiracial). Overall, 5.5% (n=777) had either prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. The 2 highest loneliness quartiles were associated with increased odds of prediabetes/type 2 diabetes (Q3: OR=1.42 [95% CI=1.15, 1.76] and Q4: OR=1.78 [95% CI=1.45, 2.19]). Greater stress and discrimination and lower social support and neighborhood social cohesion were also associated with increased odds of prediabetes/type 2 diabetes. Latent class analysis revealed 3 distinct phenotypes, with elevated odds of prediabetes/type 2 diabetes in the 2 with the most adverse social profiles (OR=2.32 [95% CI=1.89, 2.84] and OR=1.28 [95% CI=1.04, 1.58]). Conclusions: Loneliness and related experiences are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in young adults. Whether these factors could be leveraged to reduce type 2 diabetes risk should be investigated. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206211212,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study aimed to investigate the physical activity health paradox and age-specific Type 2 diabetes. Methods: Working adults (N=5,866) in Denmark aged 30–60 years enrolled in the Inter99 cohort at baseline in 1999 were followed in a Diabetes Register. Incidence rates of Type 2 diabetes as a function of age, sex, and separate and combined levels of self-reported occupational physical activity and leisure-time physical activity were modeled using Poisson regression, adjusting for relevant covariates in separate analyses (2024). Results: Moderate/vigorous leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risk of Type 2 diabetes than light (rate ratio=0.63, 95% CI=0.46, 0.85). Strenuous occupational physical activity was associated with a slightly higher risk of Type 2 diabetes than moderate occupational physical activity, but the association diminished adjusted for covariates (rate ratio=1.12, 95% CI=0.79, 1.58). Sedentary leisure-time physical activity combined with any level of occupational physical activity was associated with higher risk of Type 2 diabetes than light leisure-time physical activity/moderate occupational physical activity combined (e.g., sedentary leisure-time physical activity and demanding occupational physical activity) (rate ratio=1.68, 95% CI=1.14, 2.48). Moderate/vigorous leisure-time physical activity combined with any level of occupational physical activity was associated with lower risk of Type 2 diabetes (e.g., moderate/vigorous leisure-time physical activity and moderate occupational physical activity) (rate ratio=0.6, 95% CI=0.39, 0.92). Conclusions: Leisure-time physical activity lowered the risk of Type 2 diabetes regardless of the level of occupational physical activity, whereas no similar beneficial effects were found for occupational physical activity level. The differential effects of occupational physical activity and leisure-time physical activity on Type 2 diabetes suggest that the paradox may also exist in Type 2 diabetes. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216946290,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: The paper proposes a duplication method-based multivariate Wald test in the Cox proportional hazard regression model to test the difference in the associations of multiple exposures with a same outcome. This method applies to continuous or categorical exposures. For illustration, the method was applied to compare the associations between alignment to 2 different dietary patterns (Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 and reversed empirical dietary inflammatory pattern), either as continuous or quartile exposures, and incident chronic diseases, defined as a composite of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, in the Health Professional Follow-up Study. Relevant sample codes in R that implement the proposed approach are provided. The present analysis was conducted in 2024. Results: With a median follow-up of 22 years, there were a total of 14,427 chronic disease incidences among N=43,185 men included in the Health Professional Follow-up Study analysis. The hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) per increment from the 10th to the 90th percentile for incident chronic disease were 0.83 (0.79, 0.87) for Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 and 0.76 (0.73, 0.80) for reversed empirical dietary inflammatory pattern. Although the 95% CIs were overlapped for each exposure, the proposed test was well powered to detect the difference (p=0.005). Conclusions: The proposed duplication-method-based approach offers a flexible, formal statistical test for heterogeneity in the associations of multiple exposures with the common outcome with minimal assumptions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215253710,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study examined whether and to what degree racial differences in Type 2 diabetes were explained by exercise. Methods: Adults aged 45–84 years without Type 2 diabetes at baseline (2000–2002) were included from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort and followed through 2020. Associations between race and Type 2 diabetes were examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression. The effects of exercise were assessed using natural mediation effects. Analyses were conducted in 2023. Results: Controlling for confounders, Hispanic (adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI]=2.02 [1.74, 2.34]), Chinese (1.50 [1.24, 1.82]), and Black (1.66 [1.44, 1.93]) participants had higher Type 2 diabetes risks than White participants. Hispanic (β [SE]= −0.29 [0.04] square root of MET-hour/day, p<0.001) and Chinese (−0.25 [0.04], p<0.001) participants had lower habitual intentional exercise than White participants; this was not true for Black participants (−0.01 [0.03], p=0.85). Habitual intentional exercise explained Type 2 diabetes excess risk by 13.6% for Hispanic and 13.2% for Chinese participants but not for Black participants, compared with that for White participants. Conclusions: Habitual intentional exercise accounted for one tenth of the racial differences in Type 2 diabetes when comparing Hispanic or Chinese populations with White populations. Interventions promoting exercise are crucial to decrease Type 2 diabetes risk for all racial groups but may also narrow disparities in Type 2 diabetes among Hispanic and Chinese populations. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217398157,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
To M.; Arimoto Y.; Honda N.; Furusho N.; Kinouchi T.; Takeshita Y.; Haruki K.; To Y.,Elevated oxidative stress and steroid insensitivity in patients with asthma and high body fat percentage,2025,"Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology",10.1016/j.anai.2025.03.009,"Background: Obesity is a risk factor for poor asthma control. Previous research suggests that patients with asthma and obesity have reduced responsiveness to corticosteroids. Recent studies indicate that body fat percentage may be more strongly associated with obesity-related diseases compared with body mass index. However, the relationship between body fat percentage and asthma, particularly regarding steroid sensitivity, remains unclear. Objective: To investigate the association between body fat percentage and steroid sensitivity in patients with asthma and elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying this association. Methods: Adult patients with asthma were enrolled and categorized into patients with high body fat percentage (HBF) and control groups. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood samples. These cells were cultured with dexamethasone followed by stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α to assess the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of dexamethasone (IC50-Dex). Serum adipocytokines and oxidative stress markers were also measured. The effects of metformin on steroid sensitivity and oxidative stress in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were evaluated ex vivo. Results: The HBF group exhibited significantly higher IC50-Dex values than the control group. In the HBF group, IC50-Dex correlated with the number of acute exacerbations per year and serum oxidative stress marker levels. Treatment with metformin significantly reduced both IC50-Dex and oxidative stress marker levels in the HBF group. Conclusion: Oxidative stress associated with increased body fat may contribute to impaired steroid sensitivity in patients with asthma. Metformin may improve steroid sensitivity by reducing oxidative stress, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach in this patient population. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001869102,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Aim of this study was to evaluate the mid-term outcomes of “short” inframalleolar vein bypasses in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) after the previously failed tibial endovascular recanalization. Methods: Between January 2015 and December 2021,107 CLTI patients in 3 Italian Departments of Vascular Surgery underwent “short” inframalleolar vein bypass after failed tibial endovascular recanalization. Early (30-day) and 3-year outcomes were evaluated in terms of survival, primary patency, primary assisted patency, secondary patency, and amputation-free survival. Univariate analysis of the perioperative factors affecting outcomes were performed by the means of log-rank test. The associations of procedure variables were sought based on a multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results: Distal anastomosis (inframalleolar) was mostly performed on dorsal pedis (64, 59.8%). At 30 days, bypass occlusion was recorded in 5 cases (4.6%). The mean follow-up period was 20.5 ± 17.9 months. The estimated 3-year overall survival was 66.7%. Three-year estimates of primary patency, primary assisted patency, secondary patency, and amputation-free survival were 68.5%, 70.1%, 70.2%, and 76.7%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed a negative association of insulin treatment with primary patency (HR 4.3, P = 0.04), primary assisted patency (HR 5.1, P = 0.02), and secondary patency (HR 5.1, P = 0.02). The negative association of long-term corticosteroid use was also found with primary patency (HR 7.8, P = 0.005), primary assisted patency (HR 8.7, P = 0.003), secondary patency (HR 8.7, P = 0.003), and amputation-free survival (HR 3.9, P = 0.05). Conclusions: Short” vein bypasses to the foot arteries in CLTI patients yielded good mid-term overall patency and limb salvage rates after a failed tibial endovascular recanalization. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and long-term corticosteroid use seemed to affect the outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208178876,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic impact of ITDM and NTIDM on the incidence of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE— cardiovascular death, nonfatal infarction, nonfatal stroke, and target vessel revascularization) in the 8-year follow-up of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with a reduced ejection fraction (EF). Methods: We analyzed 2230 consecutive STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention and with EF < 50%. Echocardiographic examination was performed after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were divided into 3three groups: those with ITDM, those with NITDM, and those with no DM. Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock were excluded. Results: The incidence of DM was 20.7%; among the patients with DM, 103 (22.3%) had ITDM. Patients with ITDM and NITDM had a higher incidence of mortality and MACE, compared with patients without DM. Also, at 8-year follow-up, the incidences of all-cause mortality and MACE were significantly higher in patients with ITDM vs patients with NITDM (37.8% vs 13.1%, P < 0.001 and 40.8% vs 18.9%, P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariable analysis showed ITDM to be an independent predictor for long-term mortality (hazard ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.15-2.69), and MACE (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.15-2.62). Conclusions: ITDM was an independent predictor of the occurrence of long-term mortality and MACE in patients with STEMI and reduced EF. NITDM was not an independent predictor for the occurrence of adverse events in analyzed patients. © 2024 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211073085,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study assessed whether diabetes mellitus (DM) was a morbidity predictor after pancreatectomy within an ERAS program. Methods: A cross-sectional study including all patients who underwent pancreatectomy (2012–2022) and followed an ERAS pathway was performed. Multivariable analysis was used to determine whether DM was a morbidity predictor. Association between ERAS compliance and morbidity rate was assessed. Results: A total of 558 patients were included (266 women, median age 66, median body-mass index 25). Most patients underwent open pancreatoduodenectomy (n=369, 66%). In diabetic patients with overall ERAS compliance≤60 %, morbidity was 38/40 (95%), whereas in diabetic patients with overall ERAS compliance>60 %, it decreased to 37/50 (74%, p=0.008). DM was not found as an independent complication predictor (OR 0.7, 95%CI 0.4–1.2, p=0.186), while body-mass index>25 kg/m2 and preoperative biliary stenting were preoperative morbidity predictors (OR 1.1, 95%CI 1.0–1.1, p=0.049; OR 1.7, 95%CI 1.0–2.5, p=0.044). Conclusion: This study showed that DM was not associated with postoperative complications after pancreatectomy within an ERAS program. It highlighted the importance of a good ERAS compliance to decrease the risk of postoperative complications in DM patients. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214554677,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The study examines the thermodynamic properties, binding mode, and impact on β-Lg ‘s conformation using various spectroscopic methods and molecular dynamics simulation (MD). UV–Vis spectroscopy revealed Trp delocalization, while fluorescence and molecular docking validated the findings. The bimolecular quenching rate constant (Kq > 2×1010M−1S−1) indicated a static fluorescence quenching mechanism, with a spontaneous ground-state association driven by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis showed a reduction in α-Helix content and an increase in β-Sheet structures, suggesting partial unfolding and rearrangement of the protein. Thermal midpoint (Tm) studies showed that the interaction increases protein stability and heat tolerance. The study suggests the potential application of vitamin D3 in fortifying food products to enhance their nutritional value and stability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012488813,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

ReCET has demonstrated a positive effect on glycaemia. In this study, a single ReCET procedure was combined with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) with the goal of eliminating insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). At 12 months 86% of patients remained off insulin. Here we report the longer-term efficacy and safety of ReCET combined with GLP-1RA over 24 months. Methods: This was a first-in-human study in patients with T2D on basal insulin (28-75 years of age; body mass index, 24-40 kg/m2; hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], ≤64 mmol/mol; C-peptide, ≥0.2 nmol/L). All of the patients underwent ReCET, after which insulin was discontinued and semaglutide (GLP-1RA) was initiated. The follow-up was extended to 24 months for initial responders (off insulin and HbA1c ≤58 mmol/mol at 12 months). Primary end points were number of responders (efficacy) and number of adverse events, serious adverse events, and hypoglycemic events (safety). Secondary end points included glycemic, metabolic, and cardiovascular parameters, and treatment satisfaction scores. Results: Fourteen patients underwent endoscopic ReCET. Eleven initial responders completed the 24-month follow-up, of which 1 withdrew consent after 18 months. All patients remained off insulin with adequate glycemic control. No procedure-related serious adverse events or severe hypoglycemic events were observed during 24 months of follow-up. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and liver fat percentage improved significantly compared with baseline. Conclusions: These results suggest that duodenal ReCET combined with semaglutide is durable, allowing insulin elimination up to 24 months, and appears safe. Glycemic control was maintained, and metabolic health improved during the 24-month follow-up period. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004889297,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that the oxygen links in bcpb2− may act as hinges, allowing for extended and folded conformations of the ligand. The resulting complexes show excellent structural stability over a wide pH range. The chain polymer 1 and the 2D networks 2 and 3 are promising luminescence sensors for Cu2+ ions with ‘turn-off’ behaviour in aqueous solution. The limit of detection for 1 is as low as 6.0 nM and thus superior to other fluorescent sensors based on metal complexes. Interestingly, 1 may also be used to sensitize Tb3+ cations with ‘turn on’ performance and exhibits good anti-interference to other lanthanide cations. As a dual-sensor, it shows good recyclability and structural stability after the sensing experiments. The possible mechanism for fluorescence quenching by Cu2+ and enhancement by Tb3+ was investigated with powder diffraction, fluorescence lifetime experiments, and infrared, UV–Vis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004044434,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Nearly half of patients undergoing ablation relapse within one year. Therefore, triggered activities may not be the only cause. Inflammation is quite common in AF. In this study, we investigated the effect of PIV, an inflammatory marker, on recurrence. Methods: A total of 157 patients who underwent ablation with cryo balloon were included in the study. One-year follow-up was evaluated for causes of recurrence. Results: When the inflammatory parameters between the two groups are analyzed, CRP (5.9 [5.0–6.9] vs 9.7 [7.6–11.9], p < 0.001), NL ratio (2.8 [2.5–3.0] vs 6.4 [5.0–6.8], p < 0.001), SII2 (618.5 [557.1–679.9] vs 1798.9 [1305.8–2292.1], p < 0.001), PIV (355.9 [313.4–398.4] vs 1832 [1317.8–2347.1], p < 001) were significantly higher in the AF recurrence group. ROC analysis showed that PIV had the best sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Inflammation has been found to be a cause of AF recurrence and PIV is one of the best markers for this. © 2024 Indian Heart Rhythm Society",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000433301,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Glucocorticoids are used in its treatment at high doses at frequent intervals, causing side effects that reduce the life standard of the patients. In this study, three types of nanoparticles that include chitosan (CS) and/or sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) and/or hyaluronic acid (HA) were developed by choosing hydrocortisone (HC) as a representative model drug of glucocorticoids. Formulation optimization studies were carried out by Box-Behnken experimental design, CS:TPP, CS:HA and CS:TPP:HA nanoparticles were prepared by using chitosan solution at pH 3. CS:TPP and CS:HA ratios were chosen as 2:1 and 0.5:1, stirring time and stirring rate were adjusted to 35 min and 1000 rpm, respectively. The particle sizes of CS:TPP, CS:HA and CS:TPP:HA formulations were found as 320.9 ± 25.9, 204.4 ± 10.6, 302.5 ± 28.2 nm and zeta potentials as 28.5 ± 0.611, −14.6 ± 2.01, −17.7 ± 0.305 mV, respectively. As a result of in vitro release studies, CS:TPP:HA formulation released the least HC at the end of 24 h at pH 7.4, which represents blood and healthy synovial fluid pH, higher HC release was provided in acidic pH representing inflamed tissue environment. The particle size of CS:TPP:HA nanoparticles didn't change significantly at pH 7.4, during in vitro stability studies. 6-month-stability study results showed that CS:TPP:HA was stable at 4 °C and 25° ± 60 % relative humidity, and cytotoxicity tests showed that it was noncytotoxic. To conclude, CS:TPP:HA nanoparticles are the most promising formulation among the three different nanoparticles that were suggested for rheumatoid arthritis treatment as a pH sensitive drug carrier. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008449169,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Lactate is often utilized as a biomarker for sepsis, though its performance among subgroups such as obese patients is not well characterized. Given existing data on differences in lactate metabolism at baseline between obese and nonobese patients, this may be clinically relevant in sepsis identification and prognostication. Study Objective: We sought to compare differences in initial lactate measurements and lactate utility in predicting 30-day mortality between obese and nonobese body mass index (BMI) patients with vasopressor-dependent and non-vasopressor-dependent sepsis. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of obese and nonobese patients presenting to an adult hospital ED with sepsis with organ dysfunction. Patients were separated into vasopressor-dependent or non-vasopressor-dependent groups. The primary outcomes were differences in initial lactate and utility of initial lactate in predicting 30-day all-cause mortality by employing receiver operator characteristic curves. Results: Obese patients had lower initial lactate (2.2 mmol/L) compared with nonobese patients (2.4 mmol/L) in the non-vasopressor-dependent cohort. Lactate performed poorly-to-moderately well as a biomarker for 30-day mortality between obese and nonobese patients with sepsis, with no differences between BMI groups. Conclusion: Initial lactate levels are lower in obese patients compared with nonobese patients, but are unlikely to be clinically significant. We found no difference in lactate's utility as a biomarker for prediction of 30-day all-cause mortality between obese and nonobese patients. Lactate overall maintains some utility as a predictor of sepsis mortality, though factors that contribute to lactate levels remain unclear. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009837190,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: From the prospective observational cohort study using data from the UK Biobank between March 13, 2006, and August 31, 2017, a total of 32,281 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and higher and urine albumin to creatinine ratio below 30 mg/g (cohort 1) and 3339 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or urine albumin to creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g and higher (cohort 2), all with baseline plasma FGF21 measurements, were included. The primary predictor was plasma FGF21 levels measured by proximity extension assay. The primary outcomes were incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) for cohort 1 and incident kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT) for cohort 2. Results: In cohort 1, 804 (5.6%) participants experienced the CKD outcome during a median 13.7 years of follow-up. A cause-specific competing model revealed adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs of 1.01 (0.88 to 1.17), 1.01 (0.87 to 1.17), and 1.25 (1.08 to 1.44) for Q2 to Q4 compared with Q1 (Ptrend=.002). In cohort 2, 83 (2.5%) participants had KFRT during a median 13.7 years of follow-up. Elevated FGF21 levels were similarly associated with a higher KFRT risk, with adjusted hazard ratios of 2.79 (0.97 to 8.05), 3.91 (1.44 to 10.66), and 3.81 (1.44 to 10.08) for Q2 to Q4 (Ptrend=.01). Subgroup analysis revealed stronger association in non-CKD participants with obesity and dyslipidemia, whereas for CKD participants, this association was stronger in those with increased inflammatory markers. Conclusion: Higher FGF21 levels correlated with heightened risks of adverse kidney outcomes in individuals with and without CKD. However, the metabolic abnormalities potentially influencing this association varied according to baseline kidney function. © 2024 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009698811,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

AD involves isoforms, proteolytic products, and posttranslationally modified proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and microtubule-associated protein tau. Top-down proteomics directly measures these species and thus, offers a comprehensive view of pathologically relevant proteoforms that are difficult to analyze using traditional proteomic techniques. Here, we broadly explored associations between proteoforms and clinicopathological traits of AD by deploying a quantitative top-down proteomics approach across frontal cortex of 103 subjects selected from the ROS and MAP cohorts. The approach identified 1213 proteins and 11,782 proteoforms, of which 154 proteoforms had at least one significant association with a clinicopathological phenotype. One important finding included identifying Aβ C-terminal truncation state as the key property for differential association between amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Furthermore, various N-terminally truncated forms of Aβ had noticeably stronger association with amyloid plaques and global cognitive function. Additionally, we discovered six VGF neuropeptides that were positively associated with cognitive function independent of pathological burden. The database of brain cortex proteoforms provides a valuable context for functional characterization of the proteins involved in AD and other late-onset brain pathologies. © 2025 THE AUTHORS.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010574199,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Meeke S.D.; Weemer M.M.,Diabetes medication prescribing trends based on provider type and location in the United States,2025,Preventive Medicine Reports,10.1016/j.pmedr.2024.102947,"Background: As primary care physician numbers continue to decline, more patients with type 2 diabetes are likely to receive care from advanced practice providers (APPs), including physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Analyzing diabetes medication prescribing trends among these provider types is essential for ensuring evidence-based diabetes care. Purpose: This retrospective, cross-sectional pilot study aimed to examine differences in type 2 diabetes medication prescribing trends by provider type (physicians vs. APPs) and geographic location, utilizing National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data. Methods: Data from the NAMCS were collected in August 2022 for the years 2015, 2016, 2018 and analyzed using IBM SPSS, employing chi-square analysis to assess associations between provider type, geographic location, and prescribed medications. Frequency distributions were calculated for patient characteristics and provider types. Results: Patients prescribed at least one diabetes medication (N = 1444) were included. Most received care from physicians (93.7 %) in metropolitan areas (82.8 %). Statistically significant associations were found between provider type, geographical location, and medications prescribed. Nurse practitioners were more likely to prescribe newer diabetes medications, while physician assistants frequently prescribed basal insulin. Patients in non-metropolitan statistical areas were more often prescribed older medications, whereas those in the West were less likely to receive older medications. Conclusions: The study revealed distinct prescribing patterns by provider type and geographic location. Notably, APPs tended to prescribe newer or specific medications in certain locations, highlighting the influence of provider type and geography on diabetes care. Further studies should include larger samples of APPs to deepen insights into these trends. © 2024",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212338473,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, recurrence has been observed in this patient group. Therefore, this study aimed to identify recurrence and prognostic factors in patients with pathologic T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who were treated with surgery alone. Methods: Of the 532 patients who underwent esophagectomy with R0 resection at Hiroshima University Hospital between August 2003 and November 2018, 124 who underwent only esophagectomy and had pathological T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were included in the study. Recurrence and prognostic factors were analyzed and details of recurrence were evaluated. Results: The 5-year recurrence-free survival and 5-year overall survival rates were 84.7% and 87.2%, respectively. Recurrence was observed in 12 (9.7%) patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the histologic type (poorly differentiated compared with others) and lymphatic and/or vascular invasion (positive compared with negative) were statistically significant for recurrence-free survival. Kaplan–Meier curves for recurrence-free survival and overall survival showed that prognosis was significantly stratified according to these factors. All patients with poorly differentiated and positive lymphatic and/or vascular invasion experienced recurrence and recurrence pattern is all distant metastases. Conclusions: Poorly differentiated and lymphatic and/or vascular invasion are important recurrence and prognostic predictors in pathologic T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with surgery alone. Patients with these prognostic factors experienced increased recurrence rates, often with distant metastasis. Therefore, adjuvant therapy may be beneficial for such patients and follow-ups should be performed at closer intervals. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206618614,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Study Design: We developed an electronic clinical quality measure for postoperative respiratory failure on the basis of input from clinical and quality experts. Using 2022 structured electronic health record data from 12 diverse hospitals encompassing 2 common electronic health record vendors, we retrospectively evaluated criteria for postoperative respiratory failure after an operation during an elective hospitalization. We sampled all denominator-eligible cases meeting postoperative respiratory failure criteria, and a subset that did not, from each center. Trained nurse abstractors reviewed medical records using a standard instrument. We assessed the positive and negative predictive value of the measure (with 95% confidence intervals), and the discrimination and calibration of its risk model. Results: Among 95 records flagged by the measure and 310 denominator-eligible records not flagged, the postoperative respiratory failure electronic clinical quality measure numerator criteria had a positive predictive value of 88.7% (95% confidence intervals, 80.6–94.2%) and negative predictive value of 99.7% (95% confidence intervals, 98.2–100%). False-positive results frequently involved easily correctible respiratory therapist documentation errors. Risk-adjusted rates of postoperative respiratory failure across hospitals ranged from 0.0 to 16.8/1,000 hospitalizations. The risk model, which included 8 comorbidities, 6 laboratory tests, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, had a c-statistic of 0.91. Conclusion: Postoperative respiratory failure can be measured with high validity from readily available, structured electronic health record data. A postoperative respiratory failure electronic clinical quality measure would not be dependent on administrative claims data or collection by trained abstractors, offering the potential to inform quality improvement in elective perioperative care. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007165402,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: Patients who underwent curative-intent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma between 2000 and 2023 were identified using a multi-institutional international database. Preoperative characteristics were assessed in relation to severe complications (defined as complications with a Clavien-Dindo classification III or greater) and very early recurrence (recurrence within 6 months after surgery) using multivariable analysis. Predictive models for severe complications and very early recurrence were developed and externally validated. Results: Among 969 patients, 97 patients (10.0%) experienced severe complications, and 116 patients (12.0%) developed very early recurrence. On multivariable analysis, American Society of Anesthesiologists class >2 and greater albumin-bilirubin score were associated with severe complications. Meanwhile, a greater albumin-bilirubin score and higher tumor burden score were associated with very early recurrence. A predictive model for very early recurrence was able to stratify patients relative to their risk for recurrence: low-risk (6-month recurrence-free survival, 94.1%), medium-risk (6-month recurrence-free survival, 86.0%), and high-risk (6-month recurrence-free survival, 67.1%). A total of 74 patients (7.6%) had an unfavorable risk profile (severe complication risk ≥30% and high-risk for very early recurrence).

The use of novel agents, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), has increased in the general population due to beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and weight loss. However, there is limited data in the SOT population. A retrospective, observational, matched cohort study in outpatient SOT recipients on injectable diabetes therapy was performed at a single academic medical center. The purpose of the study was to compare glycemic control in SOT recipients using a GLP-1-RA-containing regimen compared with insulin-only when initiated within 12 months of transplant. Seventy patients were included in the analysis with 51% of subjects in each group reaching their A1c goal within 1 year after starting diabetes therapy. The median A1c was 7.0% in the GLP-1 RA group and 6.9% in the insulin only group (P = .30). One year after starting diabetes therapy, insulin use decreased to 69% in the GLP-1 RA group, while 94% of subjects in the insulin only group remained on insulin (P = .007). There were 7.2 fewer injections per week in the GLP-1 RA group compared to 4.6 more in the insulin group (P < 0.001). In SOT recipients within 12 months of transplant, the use of GLP-1 RA for blood glucose management had the same A1C goal attainment as insulin-only while allowing for fewer injections per week. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000929643,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Current guidelines endorse completion of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessments (CGAs) in older adults prior to treatment election to objectively measure frailty, however, these are rarely performed in urologic practice due to inadequate resources. We hypothesized CGA implementation would be feasible and identify multifaceted vulnerabilities beyond standard risk assessments in a multidisciplinary BC clinic and developed a novel method to visualize “vulnerability phenotypes” to guide supportive interventions. Methods: Adults with BC were prospectively enrolled (June, 2020–July, 2021). Initially, patients underwent standard of care (SOC) risk assessment (N = 27). Subsequently, patients completed CGAs augmented with body composition assessments (N = 67). CGA completion time, rates, and patient-reported burden were assessed. Interdependence of CGA domains were quantified using Spearman correlation coefficients and compared decisional conflict and regret between arms. Vulnerability phenotypes were visualized using Spider Plots, generated in R. Clinical and survival associations with CGAs were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: 94 patients were enrolled with a median age of 72 years. Instrument completion in the CGA cohort was 79% to 100%. 91% of patients reported CGA completion was at most minimally burdensome. CGAs identified vulnerabilities including 31% vulnerable-to-moderately frail, 21% with mild-to-severe depression, 3% with mild-moderate dementia, and 40% at risk for malnutrition-malnourished. Frailty measures across instruments were weakly correlated (rho <0.4). In this heterogeneous cohort, vulnerability domains were not significantly associated with decisional conflict/regret, survival, nor complication rates after treatment. A novel Spider Plot tool is proposed to facilitate communication of the dominant vulnerability-driving individual risks. Conclusions: CGAs can be successfully incorporated into uro-oncology practice with low perceived burden, identifying key vulnerabilities with implications for clinical care. Weak correlations across instruments support the value of gathering information across discrete domains. We present a novel approach to visually characterize personalized vulnerability phenotypes. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004283444,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The overproduction of a heterologous protein can impose various bottlenecks on these networks. Identifying and alleviating these bottlenecks can guide strain engineering efforts to enhance protein production. The methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii is used for its high capacity to produce recombinant proteins. Here, we use ribosome profiling to identify bottlenecks in protein secretion during heterologous expression of human serum albumin (HSA). Validation of this analysis showed that the knockout of non-essential genes whose gene products target the ER, through co- and post-translational mechanisms, and have high ribosome utilization can increase production of a heterologous protein, HSA. A triple knockout in co-translationally translocated carbohydrate and acetate transporter Gal2p, cell wall maintenance protein Ydr134cp, and the post-translationally translocated cell wall protein Aoa65896.1 increased HSA production by 35 %. This data-driven strain engineering approach uses cell-level information to identify gene targets for phenotype improvement. This specific case identifies hits and creates strains with improved HSA production, with Ribo-seq and bioinformatic analysis to identify non-essential ER targeted proteins that are high ribosome utilizers. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004345673,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to evaluate the safety of [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-I&T in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods: VIOLET was an investigator-initiated, single-centre, phase 1/2 trial, conducted at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Eligible patients were men aged 18 years or older with progressive mCRPC (histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate or unequivocal diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer with an elevated serum prostate specific antigen) previously treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and taxane chemotherapy (unless medically unsuitable), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2, and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positivity (maximum standardised uptake value ≥20 on PSMA PET-CT) without discordance on 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET-CT. Dose escalation (3 + 3 design) had three prespecified radioactivities (4·4 GBq, 5·5 GBq, and 7·4 GBq). Up to six cycles of [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-I&T were administered intravenously every 6 weeks, reduced by 0·4 GBq for each cycle. Primary endpoints of phase 1 were dose-limiting toxicities, the maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended phase 2 dose, and the primary objective of phase 2 was evaluation of adverse events as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. We present here an interim analysis, with follow-up ongoing and recruitment reopened for an additional dose level (9·5 GBq). The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05521412). Findings: Between Oct 14, 2022 and Feb 15, 2024, 30 eligible patients were enrolled. Median age was 69·0 years (IQR 66·0–74·8), screening PSA 26·9 ng/mL (10·1–70·0), PSMA mean standardised uptake value 8·2 (7·4–10·8), and 20 (67%) of 30 patients had received previous docetaxel. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. The maximum administered dose and recommended phase 2 dose was 7·4 GBq. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were limited to pain (one [3%] of 30; the only serious TRAE) and lymphopenia (one [3%] of 30). No grade 4 TRAEs or treatment-related deaths occurred. No dose reductions or treatment discontinuation occurred for toxicity. Interpretation: [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-I&T is safe at the maximum administered dose of 7·4 GBq. Further investigation of this promising radionuclide is warranted in larger, randomised clinical trials.

This study aimed to determine the incidence of type 2 diabetes over 33 481 person-years and identify its principal risk factors in middle-aged adults (ie, those aged 40–60 years) from four sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: Longitudinal data were available from 6553 participants aged 40–60 years at baseline from study centres in South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, and Burkina Faso. Sociodemographic, behavioural, clinical, and biochemical data were collected at baseline and after an interval of 5–6 years. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was determined at each timepoint and diabetes incidence was calculated. A two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis was used to identify baseline risk factors for incident diabetes. Findings: The overall incidence of type 2 diabetes was 14·6 (95% CI 13·4–16·0) cases per 1000 person-years. The incidence was highest in South Africa with 21·8 (19·5–24·4) cases per 1000 person-years, and lowest in west Africa with 5·5 (4·4–6·9) cases per 1000 person-years. Baseline glucose (adjusted odds ratio 1·37; 95% CI 1·16–1·42), being male (1·32; 1·12–1·54), family history of type 2 diabetes (1·22; 1·01–1·46), unemployment (1·19; 1·03–1·37), hypertension (1·21; 1·01–1·45), BMI (1·03; 1·02–1·04), and waist circumference (1·02; 1·01–1·03), were associated with a higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes, while adequate baseline physical activity (0·87; 0·76–1·00) was associated with lower risk. Interpretation: The high incidence of type 2 diabetes in this middle-aged sub-Saharan Africa population is influenced by several modifiable risk factors that should inform interventions to mitigate the disease burden.

We updated the systematic review and meta-analysis that informed the 2015 guidelines to inform new cutoffs for non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis for the 2024 WHO guidelines for chronic hepatitis B. Methods: We searched PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, and Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science) for studies published in any language between Jan 1, 2014, and Feb 15, 2023. We included all studies that reported cross-sectional data on the staging of fibrosis or cirrhosis with APRI, Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), and FibroScan compared with liver biopsy as the reference standard in people with chronic hepatitis B. We excluded studies in which the maximum interval between liver biopsy and non-invasive fibrosis test was more than 6 months; that reported on fewer than ten patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis; that were done exclusively in children; and did not report diagnostic accuracy across our prespecified ranges of test cutoffs. The results of this updated search were collated with the meta-analysis that informed the 2015 guidelines. Outcomes of interest were the sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive tests using defined index test cutoffs for detecting significant fibrosis (≥F2), advanced fibrosis (≥F3), and cirrhosis (F4) based on the METAVIR staging system. We performed meta-analyses using a bivariate random-effects model. Findings: Of 19 933 records identified by our search strategy, 195 were eligible for our systematic review and combined with the 69 studies from the previous meta-analysis to total 264. Two studies were at low risk of bias, 31 studies had unclear risk of bias, and 231 studies had a high risk of bias. Of these 264, 211 studies with 61 665 patients were used in the meta-analysis. For the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (≥F2), sensitivity and specificity were 72·9% (95% CI 70·2–75·5) and 64·7% (95% CI 61·0–68·2) for the APRI low cutoff (>0·3 to 0·7), 30·5% (23·7–38·3) and 92·3% (89·3–94·6) for the APRI high cutoff (>1·3 to 1·7), and 75·1% (72·2–77·7) and 79·3% (76·2–82·2) for FibroScan (>6·0 to 8·0 kPa), respectively. For the diagnosis of cirrhosis (F4), sensitivity and specificity were 59·4% (53·2–65·2) and 73·9% (70·1–77·4) for the APRI low cutoff (>0·8 to 1·2), 30·2% (24·2–36·9) and 88·2% (85·4–90·6) for the APRI high cutoff (>1·8 to 2·2), and 82·6% (77·8–86·5) and 89·0% (86·3–91·2) for FibroScan (>11·0 to 14·0 kPa), respectively. Using a hypothetical population of 1000 unselected patients with chronic hepatitis B with a 25% prevalence of significant fibrosis (≥F2), the APRI low cutoff for significant fibrosis (≥F2) would result in 262 (26·2%) false positives but only 68 (6·8%) false negatives. The FibroScan cutoff would result in 158 (15·8%) false positives and 63 (6·3%) false negatives. In a population with a 5% prevalence of cirrhosis (F4), the APRI low cutoff for cirrhosis (F4) would result in 247 (24·7%) false positives and 21 (2·1%) false negatives and the FibroScan cutoff would result in 105 (10·5%) false positives and nine (0·9%) false negatives. Interpretation: These findings have informed new thresholds of APRI and FibroScan for diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in the 2024 WHO guidelines on chronic hepatitis B, with an APRI score greater than 0·5 or a FibroScan value greater than 7·0 kPa considered to identify most adults with significant fibrosis (≥F2) and an APRI score greater than 1·0 or a FibroScan value greater than 12·5 kPa to identify most adults with cirrhosis (F4). These patients are a priority for antiviral treatment. Funding: WHO. © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Singh M.; Phillips K.; Wang J.; Subramanian A.; Eastwood K.-A.; Nirantharakumar K.; Crowe F.L.,"Trends in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases during pregnancy in the UK, 2000–21: a retrospective cohort study",2025,The Lancet Rheumatology,10.1016/S2665-9913(25)00039-6,"Background: Autoimmune diseases are increasingly prevalent worldwide and disproportionately affect women of reproductive age, including during pregnancy. Given the association between autoimmune diseases, comorbidities, and risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, we aimed to estimate the burden of autoimmune disease in pregnancy. Methods: This was a UK population-based retrospective cohort study using routinely collected data from two large databases (Clinical Practice Research Datalink Gold and Aurum) and associated pregnancy registers. Prevalence was calculated annually for 17 autoimmune diseases (Addison's disease, alopecia areata, ankylosing spondylitis, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's disease, SLE, systemic sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and vitiligo) in pregnancies among women of reproductive age (15–49 years) from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2021. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, describing the relationship between women's characteristics (age, ethnicity, deprivation, BMI, smoking status, and gravidity), comorbidities, and autoimmune diseases. Patient and public involvement and engagement representatives participated in formulating the research question. They also played key role in collaboration with clinicians and researchers to identify and consider the list of autoimmune diseases in the study, and played a key role in disseminating the results. Findings: 5 165 960 pregnancies in 2 831 472 women were included. In 2000–21, there were 185 208 pregnancies in 100 655 women who had a coded diagnosis of autoimmune disease. There was an increase in prevalence of the combination of 17 autoimmune diseases, from 6058 (3·5%) of 172 430 in 2000 to 8429 (4·7%) of 181 532 in 2021. Of the 17 autoimmune diseases studied, psoriasis had the highest prevalence throughout the study period. The prevalence of most of the autoimmune diseases increased from 2000 to 2021. The steepest rise was Hashimoto's thyroiditis, followed by coeliac disease, Grave's disease, and type 1 diabetes. Women in less deprived areas had higher odds of an autoimmune disease during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 1·10 [95% CI 1·07–1·14]), whereas minority ethnic groups had lower prevalence rates compared with White women (Black women 0·48 [0·45–0·51]; Asian women 0·81 [0·77–0·85]). Ex-smokers had significantly higher odds of autoimmune disease than non-smokers (1·20 [1·18–1·23]). When compared with women with a single pregnancy, the odds of having an autoimmune disease were significantly higher for women with five or more pregnancies (1·12 [1·10–1·15]). Women with metabolic and mental health conditions had significantly higher odds of having an autoimmune disease during pregnancy (type 2 diabetes, 1·41 [1·30–1·53]; hypertension, 1·07 [1·01–1·13]; anxiety, 1·15 [1·12–1·19]; depression, 1·17 [1·14–1·20]). Interpretation: The growing burden of autoimmune diseases in pregnancy calls for research into their impact on outcomes. Health policy should address gaps in specialised care to ensure individuals receive evidence-based care to prevent deterioration of the autoimmune disease and development of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Here, polymeric arsenical scaffolds with varying As-functionalized acrylamide monomer (AsAm) composition are combined with PtII giving rise to hydrogels (P1-Pt−P4-Pt) with their properties being dependent on the AsAm content. The nature of the Pt−polymer interaction has been thoroughly investigated by 1H and 195Pt NMR spectroscopy as well as FT-IR, SEM, XPS, and potentiometric titration suggesting that cross-linking occurs primarily via coordination between oxygen atoms of the pendant arsenic acid group and PtII, while secondary noncovalent interactions are proposed to provide further structural integrity and stability. Importantly, the hydrogels demonstrate potential self-healing properties, while the nature of the cross-linking promotes deep penetration of water into the loosely cross-linked networks. Finally, preliminary qualitative antimicrobial evaluation conducted via disk diffusion assay indicates that P4-Pt is active against Gram-negative (uropathogenic Escherichia coli CFT073 and Escherichia coli K12MG1655) and Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus USA 300 JE2) bacterial strains. Overall, the combination of polymeric arsenical scaffolds with PtII results in the formation of cross-linked networks generating soft, strong, and self-healing hydrogels with tunable stiffness and elasticity and preliminary indications of antimicrobial potential. © 2025 The Authors.

Although nominal concentrations (Cnom) are typically used in an in vitro bioassay, freely dissolved concentrations (Cfree) are considered a more accurate dose metric because they account for chemical partitioning processes and are informative about MOA. We determined the Cfree of IL cations in AREc32 and AhR-CALUX assays using both mass balance model (MBM) prediction and experimental quantification. Partition coefficients between membrane lipid-water (Kmw), serum albumin-water (Kalbumin/w), and cell-water (Kcell/w) as well as potential confounding factors (binding to a test plate and micelle formation) were determined to improve the MBM prediction. IL cations showed a higher affinity for both cell lines than that predicted by the MBM based on Kmw and Kalbumin/w. Their affinity for the AhR-CALUX cells was more than 1 order of magnitude higher than for the AREc32, signifying cell line-specific affinity. The MBM with an experimental Kcell/w accurately predicted Cfree. Evaluating cytotoxicity based on Cfree eliminated the leveling off of toxicity observed for hydrophobic IL cations (side chain cutoff), suggesting that Cnom underestimates the effects of compounds with high affinity for the assay medium. Cell membrane concentrations calculated from Cfree using Kmw were compared to the critical membrane burden to identify whether IL cations act as baseline toxicants. The IL cations carrying 16 carbons in the chain in the AREc32 assay and most of the IL cations in the AhR-CALUX assay were classified as excess toxicants. However, since the reasons for the deviation of experimental Kcell/w from MBM prediction remain unexplained, it is uncertain whether the cell membrane concentrations can be well predicted from Kmw used in this study. Therefore, future studies should aim to uncover the underlying causes of differing cell affinities observed across cell lines and model predictions. © 2025 The Authors.

Picoplatin emerged as a promising alternative to circumvent GSH-induced tumor resistance by introducing a bulky 2-picoline ligand. Although clinical studies were encouraging, picoplatin did not receive approval. Interestingly, the anticancer potential of prodrugs based on picoplatin is widely underexplored, and even less so the respective tumor-targeting approaches. We synthesized two new “hybrid” picoplatin(II) derivatives with an oxalate or cyclobutane dicarboxylate leaving group and their corresponding platinum(IV) prodrugs with an albumin-targeting maleimide moiety or a succinimide as reference. Picoplatin(II) and its derivatives indeed reacted much slower with GSH compared to the respective analogs cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin. While PicoCarbo(IV) and PicoOxali(IV) were reduced slowly in the presence of ascorbic acid, picoplatin(IV) was extremely unstable. All three prodrugs were widely inactive in the MTT assays. The platinum(IV)-maleimide complexes rapidly bound to albumin with stable conjugates for >25 h. Albumin-binding resulted in elevated platinum plasma levels, prolonged blood circulation, and enhanced tumor accumulation of the prodrugs in mice bearing CT26 tumors. However, only maleimide-functionalized PicoCarbo(IV) and picoplatin(II) significantly inhibited tumor growth. One possible explanation is that for albumin-binding platinum(IV) prodrugs, the bulky 2-picoline moiety prevents sufficient activation/reduction to unlock their full anticancer potential. © 2025 The Authors.

On the other hand, the ruthenium(III) complexes generally show low solubility and stability in an aqueous environment but exhibit some toxicity associated with unspecific delivery. For these reasons, numerous ongoing studies deal with their encapsulation into various delivery systems to maximize their therapeutic efficacy. One of these systems can also be crystals of nontoxic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In this work, we studied incorporation of a bioactive ruthenium(III) complex (RuC) inside MOFs derived from γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) and biocompatible potassium ions, forming CD-MOF-1. Viability studies in vitro were carried out using spheroids of human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2. These studies revealed that the RuC-CD-MOF-1 system provides effective cancer cell suppression through slow gradual release over a longer period (>10 days) while reducing acute cytotoxic effects associated with naked RuC. This combination was defined for further development and optimization as a drug-delivery platform for metallodrugs. © 2025 The Authors.

By employing diverse aliphatic linkers and statine-based transition-state mimics, we constructed a focused library of 624 macrocyclic compounds. Screening identified several subnanomolar inhibitors with desirable pharmacokinetic and antifungal properties. Lead compound 25 exhibited a Ki of 180 pM, significant selectivity against host proteases, and potent antifungal activity in culture.

The first step involved all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) modeling of physicochemical characteristics yielding PARG molecule conformations, its contour length, and the cross-section area. It was also shown that PARG molecules, even in concentrated electrolyte solutions (100 mM NaCl), assume a largely elongated shape with an aspect ratio of 36. Using the parameters derived from MD, the PARG adsorption kinetics at the silica/electrolyte interface was calculated using the random sequential adsorption approach. These predictions were validated by optical reflectometry measurements. It was confirmed that the molecules irreversibly adsorbed in the side-on orientation and their coverage agreed with the elongated shape of the PARG molecule predicted from the MD modeling. These theoretical and experimental results were used for the interpretation of the quartz crystal microbalance measurements carried out under various pH conditions. A comprehensive analysis unveiled that the results stemming from the hydrodynamic theory postulating a lubrication-like (soft) contact of the macroion molecules with the sensor adequately reflect the adsorption kinetics. The range of validity of the intuitively used Sauerbrey model was also estimated. It was argued that acquired results can be exploited to control macroion adsorption at solid/liquid interfaces. This is essential for the optimum preparation of their supporting layers used for bioparticle immobilization and shell formation at nanocapsules in targeted drug delivery. © 2025 The Authors.

In the vast landscape of innovative materials developed to counteract artwork degradation, gels have emerged as ideal candidates for cleaning delicate and complex surfaces. More specifically, twin-chain networks (TCNs), i.e., sponge-like hydrogels obtained through spontaneous polymer-polymer phase separation and sustainable freeze-thawing, showed unprecedented cleaning performances on modern/contemporary iconic paintings, such as works by Jackson Pollock and Pablo Picasso. The key to their efficacy lies in the complex cleaning mechanism at the gel-substrate interface. Recent findings suggest that the pore size and connectivity, affecting the nanoscale tortuosity, play a crucial role in determining the gels’ uptake (cleaning) ability. Nonetheless, diffusion of soil through the gel networks is only part of the complex processes that control the removal of unwanted layers from painted surfaces. A deeper understanding of the cleaning mechanism requires studying the uptake of solid particulate matter: gel adhesion and surface roughness affect the cleaning performance of a gel. In this work, TCNs with modulated porosity, obtained by mixing poly(vinyl alcohol)s (PVAs) of different hydrolysis degrees and molecular weights, were characterized through different techniques (confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and rheology) to relate porosity and structural features to the surface roughness and diffusional properties of the gels. Finally, cleaning tests on model painted surfaces revealed a clear connection between the surface inhomogeneity and the cleaning performance of the gels. © 2025 The Authors.

Nowadays there has been a significant increase in interest in 5-HT7 and 5-HT5A receptors in the context of cancer treatment. The possible role of 5-HT6R in the pathogenesis and progression of glioma remains an interesting and relatively unexplored issue. We developed a new group of long-chain 2-aminoquinazoline sulfonamides as new multifunctional serotonin receptor ligands, focused on 5-HT6R. The chosen group was further evaluated for antiproliferative effects on 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, along with U87MG, U-251, and LN-229 glioblastoma cell lines. Certain compounds were subjected to in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) testing, for assessing factors such as lipophilicity, plasma protein binding, phospholipid affinity, potential for drug-drug interactions (DDI), membrane permeability (PAMPA), metabolic stability, and hepatotoxicity. Additionally, in vivo testing was performed using the Danio rerio model. The developed group includes the selective 5-HT6R antagonist PP 15, dual ligand for 5-HT1AR/5-HT6R PP 13, and dual ligand for 5-HT5AR/5-HT6R PP 10.

These AAs are known as intercalating agents for MMT clay, providing the formation of the nanoplates. Using spin-polarized density functional theory (SP-DFT), the magnetic moment and its tunability to the position of Fe and Mg impurities in the MMT nanoclay crystal lattice, along with the alignment of AA molecules on the nanoclay surface, have been investigated. There is substantial charge transfer between the AA molecule (a donor) and the MMT nanoclay (an acceptor), indicating their strong electrostatic interaction. Moreover, it is found that AA molecules stabilize Fe(II) and prevent its oxidation to Fe(III) through strong interactions with the nanoclay, highlighting the significance of clay-amino acid interactions. The calculations predict the possible transition in magnetic orders (ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and ferrimagnetic) governed by interactions between the MMT nanoclay and the AA molecules in the vacuum and aqueous medium. The significant magnetic exchange coupling observed in some of the nanoclay models, in the presence of an aqueous medium, suggests a unique property of quantum ferrofluids. These findings indicate promising applications of these materials in biomedicine and bioengineering, particularly in the areas requiring an electromagnetic response, such as magnetic resonance and magneto-optical imaging, magnetic drug targeting, hyperthermia cancer treatment, magnetic separation, and magneto-mechanical sensors. © 2025 The Authors.

It has the advantage of reducing tissue damage to the brain due to the use of carbon fiber microelectrodes as well as having a high temporal resolution (10 Hz) sufficient to monitor neurotransmitter release in vivo. During the FSCV experiment, the surface of the carbon fiber microelectrode is inevitably changed by the fouling effect. In terms of redox peak potential and sensitivity against neurotransmitters, a changed electrode surface results in a voltammogram that differs from the precalibration. However, when an electrode is implanted in the brain, the method for monitoring the electrode status change is limited. In this study, we propose employing an electrochemical impedance concept to monitor the gradual change of the electrode surface during FSCV scanning. Fourier transform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (FTEIS) was used in combination with FSCV to detect the real-time impedance of the electrode. The relationship between impedance and electrode surface conditions was studied by immersing carbon fiber microelectrodes in bovine serum albumin solution to induce biofouling and diminish electrode sensitivity. As a result of the nonspecific adsorption of bovine serum albumin during the interleave scan of FSCV and FTEIS, both the measured dopamine response and the capacitance of the equivalent circuit model from FTEIS decreased over time. The capacitance and sensitivity of the electrode showed correlation (R2 = 0.90), while the resistance of the equivalent circuit did not. In vivo measurements using the interleave scan of FSCV and FTEIS were also carried out to observe biofouling on the FSCV electrode surface and to measure dopamine sensitivity in the striatum of the rat brain for an hour. The results showed that the resistance did not significantly change, while capacitance and measured dopamine were significantly diminishing over time. In summary, real-time neurotransmitter measurements and electrode monitoring with the combination of FSCV and FTEIS would be useful in neuroscience research. © 2025 The Authors.

Marzi I.; Pieraccini G.; Bemporad F.; Chiti F.,Detection of an Intermediate in the Unfolding Process of the N-Terminal Domain of TDP-43,2025,ACS Omega,10.1021/acsomega.4c08617,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a nuclear protein accumulating in intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau-negative/ubiquitin-positive inclusions, and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy. Oligomerization of full-length TDP-43, driven by its N-terminal domain (NTD), is essential for its function, but aberrant self-assembly also promotes liquid-liquid phase separation and formation of solid inclusions. Building on recent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and using various biophysical approaches, we identified a partially unfolded state accumulating during unfolding of TDP-43 NTD, before the major energy barrier of unfolding is crossed. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy coupled to a stopped-flow device at high urea concentration reveals that the intermediate state has a fluorescence emission distinct from those of the native and unfolded states and forms within the 14 ms dead time. Conventional fluorescence spectroscopy shows it still accumulates at moderate urea concentration. Circular dichroism and H/D exchange results show a species with an intermediate content of secondary structure and a distorted β-sheet, whereas SYPRO orange fluorescence indicates an open conformation with more exposed hydrophobic regions compared to the native state. Importantly, this intermediate is observed even at low protein concentration, when TDP-43 NTD is largely monomeric, indicating that its formation is independent of the initial TDP-43 NTD oligomeric state. Dynamic light scattering at high protein concentration shows that the intermediate is a partially folded dimer. The intermediate forms upon chemical denaturation and does not occur under thermal unfolding. Overall, the findings highlight the presence of one more partially folded state for TDP-43 NTD, underlining its high structural plasticity and suggesting that its distinct unfolding pathway may play a critical role in both its functional and pathological behaviors. © 2025 The Authors.

In this study, four novel polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based DESs were prepared and evaluated for their physicochemical properties, including density, dynamic viscosity, and kinematic viscosity. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and NMR analyses revealed substantial intermolecular interactions between the hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor components, confirming the formation of stable DES systems. The application of the prepared DESs was tested in biological separation, specifically for the selective extraction of bovine serum hemoglobin (BHb). This study demonstrates the efficacy of PEG-based DESs in selectively extracting BHb. Among the DESs studied, DES-4 (PEG-600) achieved the highest extraction efficiency of 88%, while maintaining protein stability. Spectroscopic techniques, including UV-visible, fluorescence, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism, and FT-IR, were employed to investigate the extraction mechanism, conformational changes in protein structure, and DES-protein interactions. These methods provided insights into the structural stability and functionality of BHb during the extraction process. The physicochemical characterizations confirmed the unique properties of PEG-based DESs, making them viable candidates for sustainable protein extraction. Their compatibility, excellent extraction efficiency, and short separation times underscore their potential as environmentally friendly and long-lasting substitutes for conventional separation techniques.

Alkali burns are common ocular emergencies that can lead to severe vision impairment if not promptly and properly treated. The low water solubility of proanthocyanidins (PACs), which are potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents, limits their bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this, hyaluronic acid (HA) was utilized as a carrier to form HA/PAC nanoparticles, enhancing PAC’s solubility and bioavailability. The HA/PAC nanoparticles were characterized for morphology, granulometric distribution, hemolysis, and cytotoxicity, demonstrating high blood compatibility and noncytotoxicity. The in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities of HA/PAC were evaluated, showing enhanced activity compared to PAC alone. In vivo studies on C57 mice confirmed the accelerated healing of corneal injuries and reduced corneal opacity with HA/PAC treatment. Histopathological analysis and cytokine quantification further supported the anti-inflammatory and proregenerative effects of HA/PAC, suggesting its potential as an effective treatment for corneal alkali burns. © 2025 The Authors.

The screening process was performed using 46 compounds, and the best-scoring model with the top statistical values was considered for bacterial and fungal targets Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. As a result of 3D-QSAR analysis, compound 4v-(S)- and 4v-(R)-isomers were found to be more potent compared to the standard drugs tetracycline and fluconazole, respectively. Furthermore, the enantiomerically pure isomers 4q, 4d′, 4n, 4f′, 4v, 4q′, 4c, and 4p′ were found to be more potent than tetracycline and fluconazole to inhibit the bacterial and fungal growth against B. subtilis, Salinivibrio proteolyticus, C. albicans, and Aspergillus niger, respectively.

High-resolution imaging techniques and targeted nanoparticles offer potential solutions for early detection and monitoring of TNBC. In this study, we developed and characterized solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) conjugated with a C-peptide derived from endostatin to target integrin αvβ3, overexpressed in TNBC. These SLNs were loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radiolabeled with technetium-99m (99mTc) for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), enabling dual-modality imaging. Extensive characterization of the nanoparticles was performed utilizing a variety of advanced techniques, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). This comprehensive analysis validated the successful synthesis and functionalization of the nanoparticles, along with their remarkable magnetic properties, while also revealing their distinct spherical morphology, optimal size, uniform distribution, and colloidal stability. The conjugation of C-peptide significantly enhanced the targeting efficiency in vitro, as evidenced by the MTT and receptor-binding assays in 4T1 cells using flow cytometry and MRI. In vivo studies using a 4T1 murine model demonstrated that peptide-conjugated SLNs accumulated in tumor tissues, providing superior contrast in MRI and enhanced tumor-specific localization in SPECT imaging. Biodistribution analysis confirmed reduced off-target accumulation, particularly in the liver, compared to nontargeted formulations.

Results indicated that the Zn2-HDA-CS beads achieved a maximum adsorption capacity of approximately 35% within 90 min. The analysis of plasma concentrations of Zn2, albumin, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) indicated that the adsorption process involved a complex interaction between testosterone-bound SHBG and albumin for Zn2 binding sites on the beads. Additionally, the adsorbent demonstrated good storage stability and selectivity for testosterone, with minimal impact on total protein content in plasma.

While macromolecules featuring amino groups are already known to successfully mediate the formation of stable gold colloids in one-pot, two-reactant, no workup reactions in aqueous media, we herein report the discovery that, under mild reaction temperatures, polymers of outstanding biomedical interest not only can play the simultaneous role of reducing and capping agent but also lead to particulate systems with unique features. From a library of samples that included branched polyethylenimine (BPEI), poly(l-lysine) (PLL), bovine serum albumin (BSA), poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (PMeOx), poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) (PHPMA), and amine-functionalized poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide-co-N-(3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide) P(HPMA-co-APMA), we found that PHPMA end-functionalized with nitrile motifs generate spherical and stable AuNPs@PHPMA of very small size (diameter of ∼2.4 nm), as underlined by imaging experiments. Cell viability experiments indicated exceptionally good biocompatibility up to very high numerical particle concentrations as compared to the other systems. The reduced size imparted to the AuNPs@PHPMA outstanding catalytic properties (no induction time and high reaction rate constant for the hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol) and antimicrobial activity (total antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and dose-dependent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus). The introduction of primary amine groups (13.4 mol %) of higher nucleophilicity known to work better for AuNP synthesis makes these unique features disappear, as evidenced for P(HPMA-co-APMA). The other systems yielded 6-28 nm particles whose properties reflected both the size of the metallic core and chemical nature and conformation of the capping agent. These findings point to novel applications of PHPMA polymers worthy of further development, especially in light of their excellent water solubility and biocompatibility. © 2025 The Authors.

We examined how body composition, measured from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and common measures of adiposity (e.g., body mass index (BMI)), are related to hormone concentrations in men from the UK Biobank study. Methods: Up to 16,237 men with available body composition data (including visceral, subcutaneous, and liver fat, muscle fat infiltration (MFI), lean tissue, and common adiposity measures) and serum hormone measurements (insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and calculated free testosterone) were included. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were used to determine the geometric mean hormone and SHBG concentrations across categories of each exposure. Results: Common measurements of adiposity were highly correlated with MRI measures of central and total adiposity (r = 0.76–0.91), although correlations with ectopic fat (liver fat and MFI) were lower (r = 0.43–0.54). Most adiposity measurements showed an inverse U- or J-shaped association with circulating IGF-I and free testosterone; however, MFI was linearly inversely associated, and lean tissue volume was positively associated with both IGF-I and free testosterone concentrations. All body composition measures were inversely associated with total testosterone and SHBG concentrations (relative geometric mean difference between Q5 vs. Q1: 20–30%). Conclusion: Our results show that common adiposity and most MRI measures of adiposity relate similarly to serum hormone concentrations; however, associations with ectopic fat (particularly MFI) and lean tissue were different. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207024096,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: In a retrospective cohort study using UK Biobank data, participants recalled childhood maltreatment. Linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the associations with body mass index (BMI), obesity, and T2D, adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Decomposition analysis was used to examine the extent to which T2D excess risk was attributed to BMI. Results: Of the 153,601 participants who completed the childhood maltreatment questions, one-third reported some form of maltreatment. Prevalence of adult obesity and incidence of T2D were higher with the number of reported childhood maltreatment types. People who reported ≥3 types of childhood maltreatment were at higher risk of obesity (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.47–1.63) and incident T2D (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.52–1.80). Excess T2D risk among those reporting maltreatment could be reduced by 39% if their BMI was comparable to participants who had not been maltreated, assuming causality. Conclusions: People who recalled maltreatment in childhood are at higher risk of T2D in adulthood, partly due to obesity. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207309960,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: Clinical measures included serum glucose, insulin, adipokines, blood pressure and anthropometric measures. MS was determined using the Harmonized criteria. The final sample included 2087 adults. Results: After adjusting for age, sex, and fat mass, L/A ratio, unlike HOMA-IR, was significantly associated with MS across all sites (p < 0.001). Within sites, L/A ratio was only associated with MS and HOMA-IR in the US (p < 0.001) and South Africa (p < 0.01), respectively. Leptin was associated with MS in South Africa only (p < 0.05) but was significantly associated with HOMA-IR across all five sites and within the US (p < 0.05). Similarly, adiponectin was associated with HOMA-IR in South Africa (p < 0.05) and with MS across all five sites (p < 0.001) and within each site separately, except Ghana. Conclusions: Our study suggests that individuals of the African diaspora in different geographical locations may differ in the determinants of MS. Future studies should investigate the determinants for the disparate relationships between MS, IS and adipokines across different African-origin populations. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207244017,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

So far, it remains unknown whether expression of these antigens on MC is of prognostic significance in SM. We performed a retrospective multi-center study of patients with SM using the data set of the registry of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis, including 5034 patients with various MC disorders. The percentage of CD2-, CD25+ and/or CD30+ MC was considerably lower in patients with indolent SM compared to patients with advanced SM, including aggressive SM and MC leukemia. Whereas CD25 and CD30 expression in MC could not be associated with prognosis, we found that lack of CD2 expression in MC is associated with a significantly reduced overall survival (OS) in patients with SM (p < 0.0001). Lack of CD2 was also associated with the presence of extramedullary involvement affecting the spleen, liver, and/or lymph nodes (odds ratio 2.63 compared to SM with CD2+ MC). Together, lack of CD2 expression in MC is a prognostic marker and indicator of reduced OS and extramedullary disease expansion in patients with SM.

There are well-established biomarkers for CKD diagnosis. However, the existing routine standard tests are lab-based and governed by strict regulations. Creatinine is commonly measured as a filtration biomarker in blood to determine estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), as well as a normalization factor to calculate urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (uACR) for CKD evaluation. In this study, we developed a passive flow microreactor for colorimetric urine creatinine measurement (uCR-Chip), which is highly amenable to integration with our previously developed microfluidic urine albumin assay. The combination of the 2-phase pressure compensation (2-PPC) technique and microfluidic channel network design accurately controls the fluidic mixing ratio and chemical reaction. Together with an optimized observation window (OW) design, a uniform and stable detection signal was achieved within 7 min. The color signal was measured by a simple USB microscope-based platform to quantify creatinine concentration in the sample. The combination of the custom in-house photomask production techniques and dry-film photoresist-based lithography enabled rapid iterative design optimization and precise chip fabrication. The developed assay achieved a dynamic linear detection range up to 40 mM and a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 0.521 mM, meeting the clinical precision requirements (comparable to existing point-of-care (PoC) systems). The microreactor was validated using creatinine standards spiked into commercial artificial urine that mimics physiological matrix. Our results showed acceptable recovery rate and low matrix effect, especially for the low creatinine concentration range in comparison to a commercial PoC uACR test. Altogether, the developed uCR-Chip offers a viable PoC test for CKD assessment and provides a potential platform technology to measure various disease biomarkers.

Herein, we sought to examine epigenetic modifications (i.e., DNA methylation) related to fatigue in peripheral blood among patients during and after treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC). Further, we determined whether these modifications were associated with gene expression and inflammatory protein markers, which we have previously linked to fatigue in HNC. This prospective, longitudinal study enrolled eligible patients with data collected at pre-radiotherapy, end of radiotherapy, and six months and one-year post-radiotherapy. Fatigue data were reported by patients using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)-20. DNA methylation (Illumina MethylationEPIC) and gene expression (Applied Biosystems Clariom S) arrays and assays for seven inflammatory markers (R&D Systems multiplex) were performed. Mixed models and enrichment analyses were applied to establish the associations. A total of 386 methylation loci were associated with fatigue among 145 patients (False Discovery Rate [FDR] < 0.05). Enrichment analyses showed the involvement of genes related to immune and inflammatory responses, insulin and lipid metabolism, neuropsychological disorders, and tumors. We further identified 16 methylation-gene expression pairs (FDR < 0.05), which were linked to immune and inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism. Ninety-one percent (351) of the 386 methylation loci were also significantly associated with inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin 6, c-reactive protein; FDR < 0.05), which further mediated the association between methylation and fatigue (FDR < 0.05). These data suggest that epigenetic modifications associated with inflammation and immunometabolism, in conjunction with relevant gene expression and protein markers, are potential targets for treating fatigue in HNC patients. The findings also merit future prospective studies in other cancer populations as well as interventional investigations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197686272,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to investigate thymic morphological alterations and their corresponding heterogeneity in patients with schizophrenia. Imaging-derived thymic morphology was assessed and compared between 419 patients with schizophrenia and 460 age- and sex-matched control participants aged 16–40 years who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scanning. These included measurements reflecting thymic size and density, such as average maximal thickness, anteroposterior distance, and average CT attenuation, which were also used to identify patient subtypes based on an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Once the thymus-based patient subtypes were identified, between-subtype differences in the thymic and blood immunometabolic profiles were further tested. Case-control comparisons revealed that patients had greater average maximal thickness (Glass’s delta [Δ] effect size = 0.37) but lower average CT attenuation (Δ = −0.18) in the thymus than controls. Two thymus-based subtypes with disparate thymic and blood immunometabolic profiles were identified. Specifically, Subtype 1 (containing 40.1% of patients) was characterized as greater average maximal thickness (Δ = 1.36) and longer anteroposterior distance (Δ = 0.71) but lower CT attenuation (Δ = −0.97), contrary to the abnormal patterns of Subtype 2. Furthermore, Subtype 1 had higher levels of blood immunometabolic profiles, such as lymphocyte count and lipid measures, than Subtype 2. Altered thymic morphology with considerable heterogeneity was first reported in schizophrenia, providing evidence for the immune hypothesis and facilitating the discovery of imaging biomarkers reflecting the immunometabolic status. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000357329,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Subjects/Methods: Here, we investigated a population-based cohort comprising children with obesity, with and without parental obesity (PO+, N = 20; PO−, N = 29), and lean healthy children as controls (N = 30), from whom plasma and erythrocyte samples were collected to characterize their multi-elemental profile, inflammatory status, as well as carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms. Results: We found parental obesity to be associated with unhealthier outcomes in children, as reflected in increased blood insulin levels and reduced insulin sensitivity, unfavorable lipid profile, and pro-inflammatory milieu. This was accompanied by moderate alterations in the content of trace elements, including increased copper-to-zinc ratios and iron deficiency in circulation, as well as metal accumulation within erythrocytes. Conclusions: Therefore, we hypothesize that family history of obesity could be an important risk factor in modulating the characteristic multi-elemental alterations behind childhood obesity, which in turn could predispose to boost related comorbidities and metabolic complications. © 2024, The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85182699570,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We investigated whether this mechanism contributes to the efficacy of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) by assessing the effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin (inulin) vs. maltodextrin (MDX) on breath hydrogen (a marker of intestinal fermentation), plasma SCFAs, gut hormones, insulin and blood glucose concentrations as well as appetite in RYGB patients. Method: Eight RYGB patients were studied on two occasions before and ~8 months after surgery using a cross-over design. Each patient received 300 ml orange juice containing 25 g inulin or an equicaloric load of 15.5 g MDX after an overnight fast followed by a fixed portion snack served 3 h postprandially. Blood samples were collected over 5 h and breath hydrogen measured as well as appetite assessed using visual analog scales. Results: Surgery increased postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY (P ≤ 0.05); lowered blood glucose and plasma insulin increments (P ≤ 0.05) and reduced appetite ratings in response to both inulin and MDX. The effect of inulin on breath hydrogen was accelerated after surgery with an increase that was earlier in onset (2.5 h vs. 3 h, P ≤ 0.05), but less pronounced in magnitude. There was, however, no effect of inulin on plasma SCFAs or plasma GLP-1 and PYY after the snack at 3 h, neither before nor after surgery. Interestingly, inulin appeared to further potentiate the early-phase glucose-lowering and second-meal (3–5 h) appetite-suppressive effect of surgery with the latter showing a strong correlation with early-phase breath hydrogen concentrations. Conclusion: RYGB surgery accelerates large intestinal fermentation of inulin, however, without measurable effects on plasma SCFAs or plasma GLP-1 and PYY. The glucose-lowering and appetite-suppressive effects of surgery appear to be potentiated with inulin. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186852957,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: Adult Indigenous Americans without diabetes (n = 501) from a longitudinal cohort underwent at baseline a 4-h MMTT, measures of body composition, an oral glucose tolerance test, an intravenous glucose tolerance test for acute insulin response (AIR), and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp for insulin action (M). Plasma glucose responses from the MMTT were quantified by the total and incremental area under the curve (AUC/iAUC). Results: At follow-up (median time 9.6 [inter-quartile range: 5.6–13.5] years), 169 participants were diagnosed with diabetes. Unadjusted Cox proportional hazards models, glucose AUC180-min (HR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.67, 2.34, p < 0.0001), AUC240-min (HR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.62, 2.31, p < 0.0001), and iAUC180-min (HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.20, 1.71, p < 0.0001) were associated with an increased risk of diabetes. After adjustment for covariates (age, sex, body fat percentage, M, AIR, Indigenous American heritage) in three subsequent models, AUC180-min (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.88, p = 0.007) and AUC240-min (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.84, p < 0.01) remained associated with increased risk of diabetes. Conclusions: Glucose responses to a mixed meal predicted the development of type 2 diabetes. This indicates that a mixed nutritional challenge provides important information on disease risk.

Taste and flavor significantly influence food choices. The aim of this study was to investigate taste sensitivity and flavor recognition ability in adults with T1D compared to healthy individuals. Subjects/methods: Seventy-two people with T1D and 72 matched healthy controls participated in the study. Participants underwent the gustometry test for sweet, sour, salty, and bitter tastes and the flavor test, which consisted of oral administration of aqueous aromatic solutions identifying 21 different compounds. Results: Participants with T1D had significantly lower flavor scores and gustometry scores than controls (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0063, respectively). T1D individuals showed a lower perception of sour, bitter and salty tastes than controls, while the perception of sweet taste was similar. The sex differences and age-related decline in flavor perception observed in controls were not present in the participants with T1D. Neither BMI nor disease-related parameters such as fasting blood glucose on the day of the study, glycosylated hemoglobin, age at onset of diabetes, duration of diabetes, or type of insulin treatment (insulin pump or multiple daily injections) correlated with flavor and taste perception in the T1D participants. Conclusions: Flavor and taste perception are impaired in adults with T1D, potentially affecting dietary adherence and food choices. This highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying sensory changes in T1D and emphasizes the importance of targeted dietary interventions to improve health outcomes and quality of life in this population. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200359587,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, human studies have presented conflicting findings regarding the correlation between circulating sRAGE levels and insulin resistance, as well as glucose tolerance. Here, we aimed to delve deeper into the relationship between sRAGE levels and systemic insulin sensitivity. Methods: Plasma sRAGE levels, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and continuous glucose monitoring were measured in two independent cross-sectional case-control studies [cohort 1 (n = 180) and cohort 2 (n = 124)]. In addition, a subgroup of 42 participants with obesity were followed for 12 months. In 14 of these participants, weight loss was achieved through bariatric surgery intervention. Results: Our results revealed a significant association between plasma sRAGE levels and both insulin sensitivity and glycemic control parameters, even after adjustments for age, sex, and BMI. Furthermore, longitudinal analysis demonstrated that interventions aimed at weight loss led to reductions in fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, concurrently with increases in sRAGE levels. Conclusions: These findings underscore that sRAGE levels were strongly associated with insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, suggesting a possible role of sRAGE in preserving insulin sensitivity and maintaining glycemic control, which should be confirmed in further studies. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206794300,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Although disease remission is possible, few biomarkers have been identified which can help us select the diet that best promotes remission. Our aim was to study the potential of miRNAs as a tool to apply the Mediterranean diet or the low-fat diet in order to achieve T2DM remission in patients with coronary heart disease. Methods: From the CORDIOPREV study (n = 1002), a prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled dietary intervention trial, all patients newly diagnosed with T2DM (n = 190) at baseline were included in the present study. Of these, after adhering to a low fat or Mediterranean diet for 60 months, 73 patients showed T2DM remission (Responders) and 110 continued with the disease (Non-responders). Plasma levels of 56 miRNAs were determined by RT-PCR. Generalized linear model, ROC curves and COX regression analyses were performed. Results: We observed that patients with low baseline plasma levels of miR-let7b-3p showed a high probability of T2DM remission after the consumption of a low-fat diet. In addition, patients with high levels of miR-141-5p, miR-182, and miR-192 at baseline showed a high probability of T2DM remission after following the Mediterranean diet. Scores built using miRNAs and clinical variables showed that high levels of a low-fat diet score and a high Mediterranean diet score were associated with a high probability of T2DM remission. Conclusion: MiRNAs could be used as a tool for selecting the most efficient nutritional therapy (mediterranean or low-fat diet) to achieve T2DM remission in patients with coronary heart disease. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218708412,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

New evidence suggests a potential association between glucosamine and type 2 diabetes, inflammation and cardiometabolic risk. We aimed to prospectively evaluate the association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of diabetic microvascular complications based on data from the large-scale nationwide prospective UK Biobank cohort study. Methods: This analysis included 21,171 participants with type 2 diabetes who were free of microvascular complications from the UK Biobank. Incidence of diabetic microvascular complications was ascertained via electronic health records. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the relationship between glucosamine use and the risk of diabetic microvascular complications. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the potential effect modifications and the robustness of the main findings. Results: At baseline, 14.5% of the participants reported habitual use of glucosamine supplements.

As the number of women conceiving through in vitro fertilization (IVF) continues to rise, this population is recognized as being at an elevated risk for GDM. However, there is still no consensus on the early prediction of GDM in IVF patients due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. Methods: We compared the first-trimester serum cytokine and antibody profiles in 38 GDM women and 38 matched controls undergoing IVF treatment, based on the extensive human biobank of our large‑scale assisted reproductive cohort platform. The 76 samples were divided into a training set (n = 53) and a testing set (n = 23) using a 7:3 ratio, and five diverse machine-learning models for predicting GDM were constructed. Results: By combining the top five differentially expressed first‑trimester serum biomarkers [including total immunoglobulin (Ig)G, total IgM, interleukin (IL)-7, anti‑phosphatidylserine (aPS)-IgG immune complexes (IC), and IL-15], a novel early prediction model was constructed, which achieved superior predictive value [area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.906 (0.840-0.971), with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 94.7%] for GDM development. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved an AUC of 0.995 (95% CI: 0.995-1.000, P < 0.001) for the training set and 0.867 (95% CI: 0.789-0.952, P < 0.001) for the test set in predicting GDM. Conclusions: We identified a set of novel first‑trimester serum cytokines and immune-related biomarkers and constructed an efficient first‑trimester prediction model for GDM in IVF population. These findings are expected to aid in the development of early predictive strategies for GDM and offer immunological insights for further mechanistic studies of GDM. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002708319,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to investigate the associations of various protein intake exposures with the risk of incident T2D in adults with or without metabolic diseases. Methods: We followed 29517 residents enrolled in the Shanghai Suburban Adult Cohort and Biobank (SSACB) without diabetes at baseline through the electronic information system. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the associations of various protein intake exposures with the risk of incident T2D, visualized by restricted cubic splines (RCS). Propensity-score matching and subgroup analysis were used to characterize the association between total protein and incident T2D by metabolic diseases. Meta-analysis further explored the association between protein intake and incident T2D in broader populations. Results: In SSACB, 1511 (5.1%) participants developed T2D during a median follow-up period of 5.69 years. A U-shaped association between total protein and risk of incident T2D was found (protective range: 12.20-16.85 percentage energy (%E), cut-off point: 14.53%E). The U-shaped association (P-nonlinear < 0.001) remained in adults with hypertension with a narrower protective range (12.20–15.35%E), with a linear association in adults with NAFLD (HR per 1%E: 0.952, 95% CI: [0.910, 0.995]), whereas no significant association in adults with hyperlipidemia or central obesity. A negative association between plant protein and risk of incident T2D was also found in SSACB (HR per 1%E: 0.947, 95% CI: [0.900, 0.996]). In addition, the U-shaped association of total protein with the risk of incident T2D was reaffirmed in the dose-response meta-analysis (cut-off point: 15.10%E). Conclusion: In SSACB, a U-shaped association between total protein intake and risk of incident T2D was found, which was reaffirmed in the dose-response meta-analysis, and differed by metabolic diseases, especially hypertension and NAFLD. Moreover, plant protein was inversely associated with the risk of incident T2D. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007152336,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study reports T1D burden among adolescents and young adults aged 10–24-year-old age group at global, regional, and national levels. Methods: Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, we described the burden of T1D in the 10–24-year-old age group. We further analyzed these trends by age, sex, and the Social Development Index. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to assess temporal trends. Results: T1D incidence among adolescents and young adults increased from 7·78 per 100,000 population (95% UI, 5·27–10·60) in 1990 to 11·07 per 100,000 population (95% UI, 7·42–15·34) in 2019. T1D mortality increased from 5701·19 (95% UI, 4642·70–6444·08) in 1990 to 6,123·04 (95% UI, 5321·82–6887·08) in 2019, representing a 7·40% increase in mortality. The European region had the highest T1D incidence in 2019. Middle-SDI countries exhibited the largest increase in T1D incidence between 1990 and 2019. Conclusion: T1D is a growing health concern globally, and T1D burden more heavily affects countries with low SDI. Specific measures and effective collaboration among countries with different SDIs are required to improve diabetes care in adolescents. Impact: We assessed trends in T1D incidence and burden among youth in the 10–24-year-old age group by evaluating data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Our results demonstrated that global T1D incidence in this age group increased over the past 30 years, with the European region having the highest T1D incidence.

Systematic review has shown increased milk quantity with relaxation interventions. We hypothesised that a self-directed audio relaxation and lactation-specific visualisation would increase milk quantity after a very premature birth. Methods: Unmasked, randomised, controlled trial, recruiting 132 participants in four United Kingdom neonatal units. Eligible women had given birth to one or two infants between 23+0 and 31+6 weeks of gestation. The intervention was a 12-min voice recording including breathing exercises, muscle relaxation and lactation-specific visualisation. Primary outcome was the highest 24-h breastmilk weight expressed on any of day 4, day 14 or day 21 after birth. Results: Mean birth gestation was 27.8 weeks (SD 2.4), with 26% of participants giving birth under 26 weeks (34/132). Adjusted mean difference in primary outcome was 73.9 g (95% CI −61.7 to 209.5, p = 0.28). Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index adjusted mean difference was −1.9 (−8.2 to 4.3, p = 0.54). The majority of relaxation group participants felt the intervention was relaxing (32/42, 76%). Conclusions: There was no beneficial effect of this relaxation intervention on milk quantity. Mothers of very premature infants may value relaxation interventions but they are unlikely to have a large effect on milk quantity. Impact: This randomised trial did not show a beneficial effect of a self-directed audio relaxation and visualisation on mothers’ own milk quantity expressed after very preterm birth. Mothers of very and extremely preterm infants may value relaxation interventions, but they are unlikely to have a large effect on milk quantity. Prior systematic review of mixed populations has shown an increase in mothers’ own milk quantity with relaxation interventions. Combining this study with existing meta-analysis could result in a new hypothesis that the lower the gestation at birth, the smaller the impact of relaxation on milk quantity. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205078985,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, the causality of these associations and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. We utilized a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal effects of blood OCN levels on AD and to assess the potential involvement of glucose and lipid metabolism. Independent instrumental variables strongly associated (P < 5E-08) with blood OCN levels were obtained from three independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the human blood proteome (N = 3301 to 35,892). Two distinct summary statistics datasets on AD from the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP, N = 63,926) and a recent study including familial-proxy AD patients (FPAD, N = 472,868) were used. Summary-level data for fasting glucose (FG), 2h-glucose post-challenge, fasting insulin, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides were incorporated to evaluate the potential role of glucose and lipid metabolism in mediating the impact of OCN on AD risk. Our findings consistently demonstrate a significantly negative correlation between genetically determined blood OCN levels and the risk of AD (IGAP: odds ratio [OR, 95%CI] = 0.83[0.72–0.96], P = 0.013; FPAD: OR = 0.81 [0.70–0.93], P = 0.002). Similar estimates with the same trend direction were obtained using other statistical approaches. Furthermore, employing multivariable MR analysis, we found that the causal relationship between OCN levels and AD was disappeared after adjustment of FG and TC (IGAP: OR = 0.97[0.80–1.17], P = 0.753; FPAD: OR = 0.98 [0.84–1.15], P = 0.831). There were no apparent instances of horizontal pleiotropy, and leave-one-out analysis showed good stability of the estimates. Our study provides evidence supporting a protective effect of blood OCN levels on AD, which is primarily mediated through regulating FG and TC levels. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying physio-pathological mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193738047,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We postulated that metabolically active tumors may compete with the brain for glucose uptake and evaluated glucose uptake in the brain and liver in patients with multiple myeloma in various states of response and relapse. The ratio of brain to liver glucose activity (B2LR) mirrors disease activity in myeloma, predicts the presence of extramedullary disease and is also predictive of a short response to chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. Patients with a low B2LR also have an inferior survival compared to patients with persistently higher B2LR values.

Notably, MASLD prevalence is lower in premenopausal women than in men, suggesting a potential protective role of estrogens in mitigating disease onset and progression. In this study, we utilized preclinical in vitro models—immortalized cell lines and hepatocyte-like cells derived from human embryonic stem cells—exposed to clinically relevant steatotic-inducing agents. These exposures led to lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and mitochondrial dysfunction, along with decreased expression of markers associated with hepatocyte functionality and differentiation. Estrogen treatment in steatotic-induced liver cells resulted in reduced ROS levels and LD content while preserving mitochondrial integrity, mediated by the upregulation of mitochondrial thioredoxin 2 (TRX2), an antioxidant system regulated by the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, disruption of TRX2, either pharmacologically using auranofin or through genetic interference, was sufficient to counteract the protective effects of estrogens, highlighting a potential mechanism through which estrogens may prevent or slow MASLD progression. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731665,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, developing hydrogel nanofiber-based nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) with tailored drug release profiles to synergistically promote angiogenesis and axonal regeneration remains a significant challenge. In this study, novel polydopamine (PDA)-modified gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel nanofibers are developed as an efficient drug delivery platform for sustained release of Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein-2 (SFRP2). This platform aims to promote neurite outgrowth, facilitate nerve function recovery, and enhance angiogenesis through Wnt signaling pathways. Results indicate that PDA coating significantly improves the hydrophilicity and mechanical properties of GelMA hydrogel nanofibers, which were fabricated using a combination of electrospinning and photo-crosslinking technology. This modification enables SFRP2 loading for sustained release through π-π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding. In vitro experiments demonstrate that SFRP2-loaded hydrogel nanofibers effectively enhance the adhesion, proliferation, viability, and migration of Mouse Schwann Cells (MSCs), while also promoting tube formation and ameliorating the inflammatory microenvironment of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, the SFRP2-loaded hydrogel nanofibers are confirmed to exert their functions for angiogenesis and peripheral nerve regeneration via the calcium-dependent calcineurin/NFATc3 signaling pathway. Finally, the hydrogel nanofiber-based NGCs are applied in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury, and results demonstrate that the SFRP2 ~ PDA@GelMA conduit significantly enhances angiogenesis, promotes peripheral nerve repair, and facilitates target muscle restoration and functional recovery, thus presents a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with peripheral nerve injuries. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009980307,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Method: Objective nutritional screening tools including geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, were evaluated in patients with GC at our institution. Malnutrition was diagnosed according to the GLIM criteria. The diagnostic value of GNRI, PNI, and COUNT scores in identifying GLIM-defined malnutrition was assessed by conducting Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. The Kappa coefficient (k) was used to assess agreement between three objective nutritional screening tools and GLIM criteria. Results: A total of 316 patients were enrolled in this study, and malnutrition was diagnosed in 151 (47.8%) patients based on the GLIM criteria. The GNRI demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.805, 95% CI: 0.758–0.852) for detecting GLIM-defined malnutrition, while the PNI and COUNT score showed poor diagnostic accuracy with AUCs of 0.699 (95% CI: 0.641–0.757) and 0.665 (95% CI: 0.605–0.725) respectively. Among these objective nutritional screening tools, the GNRI-based malnutrition risk assessment demonstrated the highest specificity (80.0%), accuracy (72.8%), PPV (74.8%), NPV (71.4%), and consistency (k = 0.452) with GLIM-defined malnutrition. Conclusions: Compared to PNI and COUNT scores, GNRI demonstrated superior performance as an objective nutritional screening tool for identifying GLIM-defined malnutrition in GC patients. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205223146,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed at investigating to which extent women with GDM adhered to dietary recommendations and to which extent an impact was observed on the glycaemic control compared to women without GDM. Subjects/methods: Women with overweight/obesity (n = 349) were recruited in early pregnancy. GDM was diagnosed with a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test in mid-or-early pregnancy (median 25.9 and 14.7 gestational weeks). Dietary assessments included an index of dietary quality (good ≥ 10 and poor < 10/15 scores) and 3-day food-diaries with nutrient intake calculated and dietary patterns identified. Glucose and insulin concentrations were analysed from blood samples collected in late pregnancy (after GDM diagnosis). Results: Women with GDM (n = 98) followed more often a healthier dietary pattern (62.2%) than women without GDM (49.0%, p < 0.05), but no difference in good dietary quality was seen (53% vs. 59.8%, p = 0.071). While the majority of women with GDM adhered to some recommendations, 51% to carbohydrate, 54.1% to total fat and 69.4% to sucrose, only 16.3% adhered to the protein and 4.1% to the fibre intake recommendations. Women with GDM had lower adherence to protein, total fat and fibre recommendations but higher adherence to that of sucrose than women without GDM (p < 0.05). A good dietary quality was associated with lower insulin and HOMA2-IR values (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Adherence to dietary recommendations, particularly fibre and protein intake, is unsatisfactory in women with GDM. Overall dietary quality is related to better control of glucose metabolism proposing a target for dietary counselling. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000291556,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Here, we investigated age-related longitudinal gene expression changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children aged 3 months to 3 years who had an increased genetic risk for T1D, aiming to delineate gene expression trajectories and identify patterns potentially linked to the development of islet autoimmunity. We found 2 432 genes (12.5% of analyzed genes) to exhibit significant temporal dynamics in the first 3 years of life. These genes were grouped into six major clusters each demonstrating distinct expression trajectories of consistent increase or decrease with age, as well as U-shaped, and inverted U-shaped age-related patterns. Notably, genes in clusters with U-shaped expression trajectories, which mirrored the incidence of islet autoantibodies, were enriched for T1D susceptibility genes, particularly within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region.

A fibroblast activation protein inhibitor modified IPMs (FAPi-IPMs) show higher targeting for activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) compared to that for hepatocytes, silencing both HSP47 and HMGB1, reducing collagen secretion and liver inflammation, thereby treating fibrosis. Moreover, IPMs and FAPi-IPMs mitigate ABC effect and produce fewer PEG antibodies than LNPs, and show minimal apolipoprotein adsorption in vivo compared with LNPs, differentiating their targeting effects from LNPs.

Enhanced mitophagy, the selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy, is a crucial mechanism that helps sustain cellular homeostasis in hypoxic tumors. In this study, we develop an azocalix[4]arene-modified supramolecular albumin nanoparticle, that co-delivers hydroxychloroquine and a mitochondria-targeting photosensitizer, designed to induce cascaded oxidative stress by regulating mitophagy for the treatment of hypoxic tumors. These nanoparticles are hypoxia-responsive and release loaded guest molecules in hypoxic tumor cells. The released hydroxychloroquine disrupts the mitophagy process, thereby increasing oxidative stress and further weakening the tumor cells. Additionally, upon laser irradiation, the photosensitizer generates reactive oxygen species independent of oxygen, inducing mitochondria damage and mitophagy activation. The dual action of simultaneous spatiotemporal mitophagy activation and mitophagy flux blockade results in enhanced autophagic and oxidative stress, ultimately driving tumor cell death. Our work highlights the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine-mediated mitophagy blockade combined with mitochondria-targeted photosensitizer for cascade-amplified oxidative stress against hypoxic tumors. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215352526,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Here we report a versatile oxidizing pentavalent bismuth(V) nanoplatform (NaBiVO3-PEG) can generate reactive oxygen species in an excitation-free and H2O2- and O2-independent manner. Upon exposure to the tumor microenvironment, NaBiVO3-PEG undergoes continuous H+-accelerated hydrolysis with •OH and 1O2 generation through electron transfer-mediated BiV-to-BiIII conversion and lattice oxygen transformation. The simultaneous release of sodium counterions after endocytosis triggers caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis. NaBiVO3-PEG intratumorally administered initiates robust therapeutic efficacies against both primary and distant tumors and activates systemic immune responses to combat tumor metastasis. NaBiVO3-PEG intravenously administered can efficiently accumulate at the tumor site for further real-time computed tomography monitoring, immunotherapy, or alternative synergistic immune-radiotherapy.

The interaction between NP surfaces and plasma-resident biomolecules results in the formation of a biomolecular corona, which varies patient-to-patient and as a function of disease state. This study investigates how the progression of acute systemic inflammatory disease influences NP corona compositions and the corresponding effects on innate immune cell interactions, phenotypes, and cytokine responses. NP coronas alter cell associations in a disease-dependent manner, induce differential co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecule expression, and influence cytokine release. Integrated multi-omics analysis of proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and cytokine datasets highlight a set of differentially enriched TLR4 ligands that correlate with dynamic NP corona-mediated immune activation. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout studies validate that NP coronas mediate this response through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling. Our findings illuminate the personalized nature of corona formation under a dynamic inflammatory condition and its impact on NP-mediated immune activation profiles and inflammation, suggesting that disease progression-related alterations in plasma composition can manifest in the corona to cause unintended toxicity and altered therapeutic efficacy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216608290,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

It remains elusive how macrophages detach these surface-bound particles during phagocytosis. We show that, rather than binding directly to these particles, macrophages form unique β2 integrin-mediated adhesion structures at the cell-substrate interfaces, specifically encircling the surface-bound particles. These circular adhesion structures that we named phagocytic adhesion rings (PARs) serve as strongholds to support local ring-shaped actin structures constricting into the particle-substrate cleavages, thereby pinching off the particles from the substrate. During this process, integrins in PARs sustain tensions due to the reaction force of actin polymerization against the particles. Such tensions are critical for phagocytic efficiency of surface-bound particles. PARs were formed in all tested macrophages (mouse, human and fish) and micron-sized particles (microbeads and E. coli), demonstrating their conserved role in the phagocytosis.

Copper (Cu), a redox-active metal ion, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), and its dysregulation contributes to aging.

Our previous works have highlighted the contribution of increased matrix stiffness to lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis in HCC. However, whether increased matrix stiffness influences glucose metabolism and supply of lung pre-metastatic niche remains largely unclear. Here we uncover the underlying mechanism by which matrix stiffness-tuned exosomal miRNAs as the major contributor modulate glucose enrichment during lung pre-metastatic niche formation through decreasing the glucose uptake and consumption of lung fibroblasts and increasing angiogenesis and vascular permeability.

We introduce the Clinical Transformer, an explainable transformer-based deep-learning framework that addresses these challenges. Our framework maximizes data via self-supervised, gradual, and transfer learning, and yields survival predictions surpassing performance of state-of-the-art methods across diverse, independent datasets. The framework’s generative capability enables in silico perturbation experiments to test counterfactual hypotheses.

Clusters fall into two types: “non-diabetogenic hyperinsulinemia,” where clusters are not associated with increased T2D risk, and “diabetogenic hyperinsulinemia,” where T2D associations are driven by body fat distribution, liver function, circulating lipids, or inflammation. In over 1.1 million multi-ancestry individuals, we demonstrated that diabetogenic hyperinsulinemia cluster-specific polygenic scores exhibit varying risks for cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke.

In this study, we use a heart-specific knockout (KO) mouse model (MyH6•Pgrmc2flox/flox) in which the Pgrmc2 gene was selectively deleted in cardiomyocytes. Here we show that PGRMC2 serves as a mediator of steroid hormones for rapid calcium signaling in cardiomyocytes to maintain cardiac contraction, sufficient stroke volume, and adequate cardiac output by regulating the cardiac pressure-volume relationship. The KO hearts from male and female mice exhibit an impairment in pressure-volume relationship. Under hypoxic conditions, this pressure-volume dysregulation progresses to congestive left and right ventricular failure in the KO hearts.

The centres can be reversibly oxidized by O2 and H2O2, resulting in a di-Fe3+ form that is non-labile. In the reduced state, a proportion of the iron becomes labile, based on accessibility to Fe2+ chelators and reconstitution experiments, consistent with dynamic iron binding.

This is noteworthy because MMP2 is the most abundant MMP in blood, and MMPs promote atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Artificial intelligence (AlphaFold)-based modeling suggested that APOA1 and MMP2 interact; direct interactions were confirmed using five orthogonal interaction assays, showing that APOA1 binds to MMP2 catalytic and hemopexin-like domains.

Interestingly, clinical isolates, and other Candida spp., can cause infection independent of filamentation or toxin production. These strains and species often are characterized as avirulent ex vivo, yet this does not correlate with their potential to cause infection. We hypothesized that specific host factors, which trigger pathogenicity in vivo, are absent in in vitro infection models and thereby clinical isolates can seem avirulent ex vivo. We investigated how albumin, the most abundant protein in humans, impacts infection and cytotoxic potential of C. albicans in vitro. The presence of albumin induces otherwise non-damaging and non-filamentous clinical isolates to cause host cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, avirulent deletion mutants deficient in filamentation, adhesion, or toxin production are restored in their cytotoxicity by albumin. This involves transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming of C. albicans, increasing biofilm formation and production of the oxylipin 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, driving host cell cytotoxicity. Collectively, our study uncoveres a pathogenicity mechanism by which C. albicans causes epithelial cytotoxicity independent of its conventional virulence mechanisms. This alternative pathogenicity strategy helps to explain the avirulence of clinical isolates ex vivo, when they are separated from the host environment. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010632123,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We conducted two case-control studies among COVID-19 infected individuals in the UK Biobank to explore the association of sociodemographic factors, clinical biomarkers, and comorbidities with the risk of two key phenotypes: Long COVID (LC, defined by patient self-report symptoms) and post-acute complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PACS, defined by clinical diagnosis), separately. Our study included 8,668 participants in the LC cohort (32% classified as cases) and 108,407 in the PACS cohort (with 2% being cases). Findings showed that age and sex were associated with both LC and PACS but in opposite directions. Additionally, obesity, socioeconomic deprivation, elevated C-reactive protein, triglyceride, vitamin D, HbA1c, cystatin C, urate, and alanine aminotransferase, and decreased HDL cholesterol and IGF-1, as well as CKD and COPD, were associated with LC. Most of these factors were also significant for PACS, except for alanine aminotransferase and vitamin D. These findings have potential mechanistic implications for the distinction between LC and PACS and can guide clinical implementation of identifying high-risk groups for targeted vaccination or other public health mitigation strategies. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012303025,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Our clinical studies find that pathological elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid homeostasis imbalance are closely associated with dysfunction of dendritic cells (DCs) in the immunosuppressive lymph nodes (LNs) microenvironment of TNBC patients following immunotherapy, which greatly affect the immunotherapeutic efficacy. Building on this, we introduce a chimeric exosomes-derived immunomodulator involving the polysulfide bond-bridged mesoporous silica as both the ROS scavenger and responsive carrier nucleus, loading with the lipid modulator toyocamycin and being coated with chimeric exosomes comprising DCs-derived exosomes and Salmonella outer membrane vesicles. This multifaceted immunomodulator can significantly enhance LNs’ homing through homologous targeting and chemokine-guided navigation, enabling ROS-responsive drug release, thereby restoring functions of DCs and LNs immuno-microenvironment. As expected, the immunomodulator significantly improves the responsiveness of TNBC to immunotherapy, exerting potent inhibition on both the primary tumor and metastases, while promoting a substantial increase in central memory T cells within LNs for sustained antitumor immunity. Our study provides a potent strategy for translational immunotherapy through optimizing the LNs microenvironment in TNBC. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012610741,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Tamogi-take mushrooms (Pleurotus cornucopiae) are known to contain high levels of Ergothioneine (EGT), an antioxidant with potential health benefits. In this study, we assessed the possibility that long-term consumption of Tamogi-take mushrooms might attenuate age-related decline in cardiac and vascular endothelial function in mice. We found that long-term intake of Tamogi-take mushrooms significantly maintained cardiac and vascular endothelial function and improved exercise tolerance in mice. Long-term mushroom consumption also increased levels of Nrf2 (Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2) protein in heart tissues and increased translation of HO-1 (Heme Oxygenase 1) proteins, which have antioxidant effects in heart and aortic tissues. Finally, long-term Tamogi-take mushroom consumption inhibited ROS accumulation with aging and reduced expression of inflammatory biomarkers. We conclude that ingestion of Tamogi-take mushrooms could serve as a dietary intervention to promote cardiovascular health, support healthy aging and slow the progression of age-related diseases. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217011899,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, the mechanisms driving obesity-associated therapy resistance remain unclear; in part due to a lack of suitable models that recapitulate the obese tumour microenvironment. To address this, we developed a 3D in vitro model of obesity-associated breast cancer, to investigate biological mechanisms and to use as a drug testing tool. A penta-culture system was developed by co-culturing adipocyte spheroids with breast tumour cells, myoepithelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts in a collagen matrix. Tumour cells and macrophages infiltrated adipocyte spheroids, replicating the inflamed-adipose border typical of obese patients. This model was then assessed as a drug testing platform. Obese cultures exhibited increased sensitivity to metformin and, conversely, resistance to paclitaxel, compared to non-obese cultures. This 3D organotypic model effectively recapitulates key features of the obese adipose tumour microenvironment, providing a useful tool to interrogate mechanisms underpinning obesity-related therapy resistance. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006724703,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Though it is well acknowledged that microgravity provides necessary mechanical force signals for cell fate2, how microgravity affects growth, differentiation, and communication is still largely unknown due to the lack of real experimental scenarios and reproducibility tools. Here, Rotating Flat Chamber (RFC) was used to simulate ground-based microgravity effects to study how microgravity effects affect the differentiation of HepaRG (hepatic progenitor cells) cells. Unexpectedly, the results show that RFC conditions could promote HepaRG cell differentiation which exhibited increased expression of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin (ALB), and Recombinant Cytokeratin 18 (CK18). Through screening a series of mechanical receptors, the ion channel TRPML1 was critical for promoting the differentiation effect under RFC conditions. Once TRPML1 was activated by stimulated microgravity effects, the concentration of lysosomal calcium ions was increased to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which finally led to enhanced cell differentiation of HepaRG cells. In addition, the cytoskeleton was remodeled under RFC conditions to influence the expression of PI (3,5) P2, which is the best-known activator of TRPML1. In summary, our findings have established a mechanism by which simulated microgravity promotes the differentiation of HepaRG cells through the TRPML1 signaling pathway, which provides a potential target for the regulation of hepatic stem/progenitor cell differentiation and embryonic liver development under real microgravity conditions.

Here, we adopted an untargeted omics approach to disclose lipidomic, metabolomic and proteomic alterations in plasma and in dermal fibroblasts of PD patients carrying mutations in TMEM175 gene. We revealed a wide dysregulation of lysosome, autophagy, and mitochondrial pathways in these patients, supporting a role of this channel in regulating these cellular processes. The most significant altered lipid classes were Fatty acyls, Glycerophospholipids and Phosphosphingolipids. The plasma level of Phosphatidylcholines (PC) and Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 34:1 significantly correlated with an earlier age at onset of the disease in TMEM175 patients (p = 0.008; p = 0.006). In plasma we also observed altered amino acids metabolic pathways in PD patients. We highlighted that increased level of L-glutamate strongly correlated (p < 0.001) with the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD_TMEM175 patients. In dermal fibroblasts, we disclosed alterations of proteins involved in lipids biosynthesis (PAG15, PP4P1, GALC, FYV1, PIGO, PGPS1, PLPP1), in the insulin pathway (IGF2R), in mitochondrial metabolism (ACD10, ACD11, ACADS) and autophagy (RAB7L). Interestingly, we quantified 43 lysosomal or lysosomal-related proteins, which were differentially modulated between TMEM175 patients and controls. Integrative correlation analysis of proteome and lipidome of PD_TMEM175 cellular models identified a strong positive correlation of 13 proteins involved in biosynthetic processes with PC and Ceramides. Altogether, these data provide novel insights into the molecular and metabolic alterations underlying TMEM175 mutations and may be relevant for PD prediction, diagnosis and treatment. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218153659,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Given that age, inflammation, and blood MPO play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson´s disease (PD), we hypothesized that serum MPO could be associated with PD status. This case-control study (199 participants) was conducted using an extensive protocol, and the concentration and activity of MPO in blood serum were measured. The findings reveal that serum MPO concentration and activity are significantly increased in the patients, and that rates of PD in all individuals are associated with increasing tertiles of MPO concentration and activity. In multivariate logistic regression model adjusting for confounding factors, MPO activity (not concentration) is the factor that is most associated with PD status (OR, 6.921, P = 0.001). Mental depression is directly associated with MPO activity and with PD status (OR, 0.121, B = −2.108, P = 0.002). The use of statins or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs significantly reduces serum MPO activity, but the possible association with the odds of having PD does not survive correction for multiple testing. In summary, both serum MPO concentration and activity are increased in patients with PD, but only MPO enzyme activity is associated with PD status. These findings may have implications for the evaluation of PD. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003652582,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We conducted a retrospective study of 890 PD patients diagnosed during 2000-2020 and 8,100 matched controls, analyzing electronic health records up to 15 years before PD diagnosis. Prevalence was assessed annually to track changes in association strength over time. PD patients consistently showed lower MetS prevalence (OR = 0.57–0.8). Compared to controls, PD patients had lower triglycerides (OR = 0.44–0.75), BMI (OR = 0.54–0.65), and hyperglycemia (OR = 0.81–0.86) rates, and females showed higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (OR = 1.48–1.82), lower low-density lipoprotein/HDL ratio (OR = 0.46–0.64), and reduced hypertension (OR = 0.79–0.85).

The most important contributing feature to PD mortality was age, followed by male sex and pneumonia. Using XAI models, the nonlinear association between contributing factors and PD mortality was assessed, and an optimal target value to reduce mortality was found.

Despite multiple studies reporting this connection, the mechanism by which T2D exacerbates AD is poorly understood. It is challenging to design studies that address co-occurring and comorbid diseases, limiting the number of existing evidence bases. To address this challenge, we expanded the applications of a computational framework called Translatable Components Regression (TransComp-R), initially designed for cross-species translation modeling, to perform cross-disease modeling to identify biological programs of T2D that may exacerbate AD pathology. Using TransComp-R, we combined peripheral blood-derived T2D and AD human transcriptomic data to identify T2D principal components predictive of AD status. Our model revealed genes enriched for biological pathways associated with inflammation, metabolism, and signaling pathways from T2D principal components predictive of AD. The same T2D PC predictive of AD outcomes unveiled sex-based differences across the AD datasets. We performed a gene expression correlational analysis to identify therapeutic hypotheses tailored to the T2D-AD axis. We identified six T2D and two dementia medications that induced gene expression profiles associated with a non-T2D or non-AD state. We next assessed our blood-based T2DxAD biomarker signature in post-mortem human AD and control brain gene expression data from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. Using partial least squares discriminant analysis, we identified a subset of genes from our cross-disease blood-based biomarker panel that significantly separated AD and control brain samples. Finally, we validated our findings using single cell RNA-sequencing blood data of AD and healthy individuals and found erythroid cells contained the most gene expression signatures to the T2D PC. Our methodological advance in cross-disease modeling identified biological programs in T2D that may predict the future onset of AD in this population. This, paired with our therapeutic gene expression correlational analysis, also revealed alogliptin, a T2D medication that may help prevent the onset of AD in T2D patients. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006893052,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In this study, we assessed the function-immunogenicity relationship of the multi-component vaccine candidate (referred to as VC-13) to elucidate a mechanism of action. We identified a potential universal delivery platform, not only capable of adjuvanting different peptide epitopes (e.g., NS1 and 88/30 from group A Streptococcus, gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone [GnRH]), but also protein antigens (e.g., bovine serum albumin [BSA], receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 protein responsible for COVID-19 infection [SARS-CoV-2 RBD]) and small molecular haptens (e.g., cocaine). All vaccine candidates self-assembled into sub-500 nm nanoparticles and induced high antigen-specific systemic IgG titers and opsonic potential compared to the antigen co-administered with a commercial adjuvant, complete Freund’s adjuvant. Notably, presence of the cyclic decapeptide in this vaccine increased accumulation in the draining inguinal lymph nodes, facilitating cellular uptake of peptide antigens. Furthermore, the lipoamino acid promoted dendritic cell activation, acting as both toll-like receptors 2 and 4 -targeting moiety.

Although restrictive eligibility criteria contribute to this issue, the role of selection bias related to prognostic risk remains unclear. In this study, we developed TrialTranslator, a framework designed to systematically evaluate the generalizability of RCTs for oncology therapies. Using a nationwide database of electronic health records from Flatiron Health, this framework emulates RCTs across three prognostic phenotypes identified through machine learning models. We applied this approach to 11 landmark RCTs that investigated anti-cancer regimens considered standard of care for the four most prevalent advanced solid malignancies. Our analyses reveal that patients in low-risk and medium-risk phenotypes exhibit survival times and treatment-associated survival benefits similar to those observed in RCTs. In contrast, high-risk phenotypes show significantly lower survival times and treatment-associated survival benefits compared to RCTs. Our results were corroborated by a comprehensive robustness assessment, including examinations of specific patient subgroups, holdout validation and semi-synthetic data simulation. These findings suggest that the prognostic heterogeneity among real-world oncology patients plays a substantial role in the limited generalizability of RCT results.

Here, in this mechanistic secondary analysis of the SUMMIT trial, tirzepatide treatment at 52 weeks, as compared with placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure (estimated treatment difference (ETD) −5 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) −7 to −3; P < 0.001), decreased estimated blood volume (ETD −0.58 l, 95% CI −0.63 to −0.52; P < 0.001) and reduced C-reactive protein levels (ETD −37.2%, 95% CI −45.7 to −27.3; P < 0.001). These changes were coupled with an increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (ETD 2.90 ml min−1 1.73 m−2 yr−1, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.86; P = 0.004), a decrease in urine albumin–creatinine ratio (ETD 24 weeks, −25.0%, 95% CI −36 to −13%; P < 0.001; 52 weeks, −15%, 95% CI −28 to 0.1; P = 0.051), a reduction in N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide levels (ETD 52 weeks −10.5%, 95% CI −20.7 to 1.0%; P = 0.07) and a reduction in troponin T levels (ETD 52 weeks −10.4%, 95% CI −16.7 to −3.6; P = 0.003). In post hoc exploratory analyses, decreased estimated blood volume with tirzepatide treatment was significantly correlated with decreased blood pressure, reduced microalbuminuria, improved Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score and increased 6-min walk distance. Moreover, decreased C-reactive protein levels were correlated with reduced troponin T levels and improved 6-min walk distance. In conclusion, tirzepatide reduced circulatory volume–pressure overload and systemic inflammation and mitigated cardiovascular–kidney end-organ injury in patients with HFpEF and obesity, providing new insights into the mechanisms of benefit from tirzepatide.

The disease has neurovascular origin and migraine attacks can be elicited by vasodilative neuropeptides such as alpha calcitonin gene-related peptide (αCGRP). Antagonizing CGRP actions in migraine patients has proven clinically efficient. Here, we present a pipeline for development of a peptide-based hCGRP receptor antagonist with increased half-life capable of antagonising the vasodilatory effect of hαCGRP. A series of hαCGRP8-37 analogues carrying a C18-or C20-diacid lipidation was screened for their antagonism against the hCGRP receptor. hαCGRP8-37 analogues with a C20-diacid were 2-6 fold more potent than analogues conjugated with a C18-diacid. Half-life of hαCGRP8-37 analogues carrying a C20-diacid was estimated in mice in a pilot study (n = 1–2). Half-lives ranged from 7.3 to 13.7 h. An hαCGRP8-37 analogue conjugated with a C20 diacid at position 25 was subjected to an amino acid substitution scan to identify mutations that could further enhance hCGRP receptor antagonism. Substituting alanine with serine at position 36 resulted in a ~ 4 fold gain of potency. Vasodilative actions of hαCGRP were successfully antagonized by hαCGRP8-37 analogues carrying a C20 diacid at position 25. Our findings demonstrate that lipidation can improve hαCGRP8-37 pharmacokinetics while maintaining hαCGRP antagonism, thus demonstrating potential for a peptide-based migraine treatment strategy. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215601137,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a standard treatment, but its effectiveness is limited to a subset of the aging population. Senescent fibroblasts, a hallmark of aging, impair wound healing, and senolytic drugs, like quercetin (Q), which target senescent cells, may improve healing. In this study, we developed a mathematical model that defines biological aging through two parameters, and, that decline with age. These parameters reflect the biological age of an individual, where represents fibroblast proliferation and represents the production of the angiogenetic protein VEGF. Our model predicts that treatment with only HBOT achieves wound closure, within normal expectable time, for patients with a limited subset pairs of, and this subset is increased to a larger subset by combining Q with HBOT. The two subsets of are determined explicitly by simulations of the model. To make these results applicable in clinical setting, one will have to relate the aging parameters and to tangible marks of biological-aging factors. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005801587,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study aims to develop an injectable system for chronic tuberculosis treatment, focusing on an in-situ gel formulation created using Poloxamer 407, Carbopol 940, and Hydroxy Propyl Methyl Cellulose (HPMC). The experiments involved a combination of two FDA-approved first-line anti-TB molecules, namely Rifampicin (RIF) and Isoniazid (INZ), by loading in the in-situ gel (IGS) formulations prepared by cold process. The gelling polymers were varied at three levels of concentration and optimized through the molecular docking method, wherein the blend of polymers with drugs showed the docking score of − 3.085. The physicochemical properties and analytical characterization, including gelation temperature, drug content, FT-IR, SEM, TG-DSC, in-vitro drug release, ex-vivo permeation, and cytotoxicity, were performed. According to the study results, the optimized gelation temperature was 26 °C, the viscosity of the sol and gel was 238 cP and 1700 cP, respectively, with the maximum drug content (RIF 100 ± 2.17% and INZ 97 ± 1.31%). The FTIR analysis confirmed the stability of drugs, the morphological study using SEM showed the formation of a network structure, and thermal analysis by TG-DSC confirmed the solid-state transition of drugs. The in-vitro drug release studies in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 showed sustained release of Rifampicin and Isoniazid for up to 10 days and 6 days, respectively. The selected formulation exhibited non-toxic effects in the L929 cell line. Based on the results, in-situ gel administration could be recommended for intramuscular administration for sustained release of the drugs, which is expected to reduce the dosing frequency and improve patient compliance for chronic tuberculosis therapy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009546964,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study investigated the association between platelet count and 30-day in-hospital mortality in critically ill AMI patients. This multicenter retrospective cohort study analyzed 6,850 critically ill AMI patients from 208 U.S. hospitals (2014–2015) using the eICU Collaborative Research Database v2.0. The primary exposure was baseline platelet count within 24 h of ICU admission. The primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Analyses were adjusted for demographics, laboratory parameters, disease severity, comorbidities, and treatments. A U-shaped relationship was identified between platelet count and mortality, with an inflection point at 147 × 10⁹/L. Below this threshold, each 10 × 10⁹/L increase in platelet count was associated with decreased mortality (OR = 0.931, 95% CI: 0.892–0.973, P = 0.001). Above the threshold, each 10 × 10⁹/L increase was associated with increased mortality (OR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.010–1.036, P < 0.001). A U-shaped relationship was observed between platelet count and 30-day in-hospital mortality in critically ill AMI patients, with optimal outcomes observed at approximately 147 × 10⁹/L, suggesting that platelet count may serve as a potential risk stratification marker. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009549388,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Multi-phase contrast enhanced imaging is superior in distinguishing hepatic structures compared to single-phase approaches, but automated approaches for detailed segmentation of hepatic structures are lacking. This study evaluates deep learning architectures for segmenting liver structures from multi-phase Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted VIBE MRI scans. We utilized 458 T1-weighted VIBE scans of pathological livers, with 78 manually labeled for liver parenchyma, hepatic and portal veins, aorta, lesions, and ascites. An additional dataset of 47 labeled subjects was used for cross-scanner evaluation. Three models were evaluated using nested cross-validation: the conventional nnU-Net, the ResEnc nnU-Net, and the Swin UNETR. The late arterial phase was identified as the optimal fixed phase for co-registration. Both nnU-Net variants outperformed Swin UNETR across most tasks. The conventional nnU-Net achieved the highest segmentation performance for liver parenchyma (DSC: 0.97; 95% CI 0.97, 0.98), portal vein (DSC: 0.83; 95% CI 0.80, 0.87), and hepatic vein (DSC: 0.78; 95% CI 0.77, 0.80). Lesion and ascites segmentation proved challenging for all models, with the conventional nnU-Net performing best. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning, particularly nnU-Net variants, for detailed liver structure segmentation from multi-phase MRI. The developed models and preprocessing pipeline offer potential for improved liver disease assessment and surgical planning in clinical practice. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010715122,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The gene encodes two major isoforms coined STOX1A and STOX1B (989 and 227 amino-acids, respectively), sharing the same DNA binding domain. The two isoforms have opposite function on major genes involved in trophoblast syncytialization and oxidative stress management. Placenta-fetal overexpression of STOX1A induces preeclampsia in mice. Here we explore the effects of STOX1B placenta-fetal overexpression. A STOX1B transgenic mouse line (expression restricted to the foeto-placental unit through ad hoc crosses) was analyzed in terms of blood pressure, proteinuria, soluble antiangiogenic factors, placental and fetal weights, maternal heart weight, and placental histology. Placental gene expression was explored by RNA-sequencing, followed by a bioinformatics analysis. Female mice carrying STOX1B placentas displayed preeclampsia features with a striking increase of genes involved in coagulation, presumably under the control of the HNF4α transcription factor. Genes specific of the spongiotrophoblast were strongly down-regulated consistently with a junctional zone reduction. This new model of preeclampsia seems connected with an enhancement of coagulation processes, similar to preeclamptic patients living at high altitude. Our model could be useful to study the features of preeclampsia in this context, and be a convenient complement to other animal models of preeclampsia. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009981174,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Recently, studies have revealed increased mortality rates in dialysis patients with low LBM. However, studies analyzing the impact of age on LBM and mortality in dialysis patients remain limited. This study analyzed data from 26,625 adult hemodialysis patients registered in the Korean Society of Nephrology (KSN) registry from 2001 to 2020. We used the lean body mass index (LBMI), standardized by the square of height, to normalize lean body mass. Patients were first categorized by age group (20–49, 50–69, and ≥ 70 years). Subsequently, patients were categorized into quartile groups based on their LBMI (≤ 15.55, 15.55 < LBMI ≤ 16.52, 16.52 < LBMI ≤ 17.59, and > 17.59). This study revealed that the lowest LBMI group (≤ 15.55) was associated with decreased survival across all age groups, with this trend being particularly prominent in the older age groups. Within the 20–49 age group, factors such as diabetes exhibited a notable influence on mortality rates among hemodialysis patients. In the age group over 50, a low LBMI (≤ 15.55) had a greater impact on mortality rates in hemodialysis patients than diabetes. Understanding the importance of LBM in older patients undergoing dialysis is crucial for improving their prognosis. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216042456,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, disadvantages such as limited adsorption capacity due to low specific surface area and undeveloped porosity have led to challenges in using these materials. In this work, we use a well-known MXene, Ti3C2Tx, by decorating zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIF-8) between MXene layers (MX@ZIF) to remove methyl orange (MO) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), as well as, the effect of -O and -OH terminal groups on adsorption efficiency of MX@ZIF substrate is investigated. Our findings from molecular dynamics simulations showed that the MXO@ZIF and MXOH@ZIF systems have stronger electrostatic interactions than the MX@ZIF system due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the –O, –OH terminal groups from the substrates and heteroatoms of pollutant molecules. Moreover, the van der Waals energy values in the MXOH@ZIF-CIP and MXOH@ZIF-MO systems are − 253.454 and − 201.660 kJ/mol, respectively, demonstrating the effective adsorption and removal of contaminants by designed substrates. The MD results show that the van der Waals interaction has a greater contribution than the electrostatic interaction in studied systems. Also, the number of contacts of pollutant molecules with the substrate increases with time, and the highest number of contacts belongs to the MXOH@ZIF-CIP and MXOH@ZIF-MO complexes, demonstrating that this substrate has a greater tendency to adsorb pollutants. Furthermore, the results of AIM calculations confirm the presence of non-covalent interactions between pollutant molecules and studied substrates. This study shows that MXOH/ZIF can be considered a promising high-performance adsorbent for removing organic dyes and antibiotics. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001635775,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This paper proposes a method by using novel SERS-active silver flower-like material to enhance the fluorescence signal generated by qPCR instrument, so as to shorten the detection time and improve the detection sensitivity. In this method, silver flower-like material is first prepared on substrates using a lyotropic liquid crystal soft template combined with electrodeposition growth. Then, an ultrasonic device is used to peel the active material into aqueous solution, and the peeling efficiency reaches 90%. Using rhodamine 6G (R6G) as the qPCR amplification detection molecule, the fluorescence signal generated from the flower-like material-containing sample is increased by 20%. Finally, the qPCR amplification effect is detected with the commercially available new coronavirus nucleic acid detection kit. The results showed that the CT value decreased from 35 to 31 after adding the silver flower-like material, and the detection efficiency increased by 20%.

For the models constructed with all 53 variables, all five models achieved acceptable performance with the validation cohort, with the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model showing the best predictive efficacy and stability (area under the curve (AUC), 0.9301). For the simpler models constructed with 39 significant variables screened by the random forest recursive feature elimination method, the XGBoost model also had the best performance (AUC, 0.9357). All the models showed significant net returns according to decision analysis curves, and the XGBoost model achieved the optimal results. In addition, the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) importance matrices revealed that uric acid, colloidal solution, first creatinine value on admission, pulse and albumin represented the top five most important variables for both modeling strategies. With the external validation cohort based on 4022 hospitalized patients, the performance of all models declined, among which the Support vector machine (SVM) model showed the best predictive efficacy (AUC, 0.8230 and 0.8329), followed by the XGBoost model (0.8124 and 0.8316).

Soluble antigens are susceptible to rapid proteolysis, hence anchoring of antigens to bacterial cells, which likely protects the antigen, is a preferred delivery strategy that may increase immune responses. In cancer research, personalized immunotherapy has high potential and, in this respect, the so-called neoantigens that accumulate in tumor cells are promising tumor specific targets. Here, we demonstrate that, when using the inducible pSIP expression system, L. plantarum can produce and surface display two neoantigens, NAG1 and ETV6. The antigens could be targeted to both the cell membrane and the cell wall, utilizing four different anchoring methods. The production level and the degree of surface exposure of the antigens varied among the anchors. Flow cytometry analysis showed that antigens anchored to the cell wall were more exposed than those anchored to the cell membrane. To our knowledge these are the first reports of neoantigens being produced and surface-displayed in Lactobacillales. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000114515,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to identify the risk factors and explore possible mechanisms of PE in childhood following HSE. We conducted a retrospective review of children diagnosed with HSE and patients were categorized into two groups based on the presence or absence of PE. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze factors associated with PE. Furthermore, cytokine and albumin levels in paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples during acute HSE were also retrospectively reviewed. 97 HSE patients were included in the study and PE was diagnosed in 46. On multivariate analysis, the features predictive of PE (presented as odds ratio [OR] with confidence intervals [CIs]) were status epilepticus (OR 9.38, CI 1.71–10.37), focal seizures (7.41, 1.42–16.97), and restricted diffusion on MRI (6.15, 1.16–20.31). The median QAlb value (CSF to serum albumin ratio, a marker of blood-brain-barrier [BBB] integrity), levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-6:IL-10 ratio in CSF were higher in children with PE during acute HSE. However, CSF levels of IL-10 were higher in non-PE patients. Furthermore, greater CSF IL-6 levels were associated with higher QAlb. These results demonstrated that enhanced BBB impairment and exaggerated proinflammatory response may play a role in the pathogenesis of PE following HSE. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218710251,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

A promising approach involves low-frequency, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (US) waves combined with intravenously injected microbubbles (MB) to temporarily and non-invasively open the BBB. However, current technologies cannot easily integrate this procedure with US imaging. Passive cavitation detection, tracing the harmonic emissions of MB during sonication, has been the preferred method for real-time monitoring of US-mediated BBB opening. We used an ultrasound advanced open platform (ULA-OP) to simultaneously perform US-mediated BBB opening and US imaging with a single linear-array probe. In vitro guinea pig brains were perfused with MB and sonicated with different plane-wave transmission patterns. The most effective US pattern was interleaved with B-mode imaging pulses, enabling the direct assessment of the MB distribution during treatment. The extent of BBB permeabilization was assessed by quantifying FITC-albumin extravasation into the brain via confocal microscopy. US-treated hemispheres displayed BBB permeabilization, while control hemispheres did not. B-mode imaging allowed direct evaluation of MB distribution and interaction with the US beam.

Due to their widespread industrial use, bromophenols such as 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP), 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) and pentabromophenol (PBP) have become prevalent environmental contaminants. These compounds are primarily found in air, water, and soil and bioaccumulate in various organisms, including fish and birds. Studies have linked bromophenols to oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and adverse health effects, emphasizing the need to further investigate their biological impacts. Due to their high hydrophobicity and bioaccumulative potential, BPs may penetrate biological membranes, potentially altering their structural and functional properties. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of three bromophenols: 2,4-DBP, 2,4,6-TBP and PBP on erythrocyte membrane parameters and metabolic parameters such as ATP level. These findings highlight the differential effects of bromophenols on erythrocyte membranes, with 2,4-DBP primarily disrupting membrane fluidity and intracellular viscosity, while PBP predominantly affects oxidative processes. This study provides new insights into the potential toxicological mechanisms of BPs and their impact on cellular integrity.

However, most large animal studies of MI are performed in lean animals. Here we assessed the impact of obesity on echocardiographic findings, infarct size, circulating biomarkers, mitochondrial respiratory capacity and mortality in a closed-chest minipig model of MI. The initial study population consisted of 20 obese (median 60.0 kg [interquartile range 55.9–64.6 kg]) and 18 lean (25.0 kg [23.4–36.5 kg]) female Göttingen minipigs. The duration of obesity induction using a western-style diet was up to approximately 6 months (156 days [24–162 days]) before the induction of MI. The induction of MI by 120-min balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was feasible in 17 lean and 17 obese animals. Mortality was higher in obese compared with lean animals (53% versus 12%), driven primarily by refractory ventricular fibrillation during occlusion. Electrocardiographic findings showed longer QRS and QT intervals and more extensive ST-segment elevation in obese animals compared with lean animals during occlusion. Plasma concentrations of pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, pro-C-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin T were significantly lower in obese compared with lean animals. Infarct size estimated 8 weeks after MI was significantly smaller in obese (10% [9–11%]) compared with lean animals (13% [13–15%]). Finally, mitochondrial-complex-I-linked respiratory capacity was overall significantly higher in obese animals; however, no group difference was found in intrinsic mitochondrial respiratory capacity. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001594330,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In this study, 2844 CRC patients, 2267 NSCLC patients and 507 HCC patients who underwent curative resection were included. Postoperative AGR was a prognostic factor independent to preoperative AGR, performing a L shaped relation with OS. The 5-year OS rates for the persistently normal, normalized, lowered and persistently low perioperative AGR groups were 84.0%, 80.7%, 78.5% and 70.2%. Three longitudinal AGR trajectory groups were identified within 12 months after surgery. Compared with the normal-stable group, the adjusted HRs on OS for the rising-decreasing and decreasing-rising groups were 1.38 (95% CI: 1.13–1.68, P = 0.001) and 2.78 (95% CI: 2.30–3.36, P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for RFS. In conclusion, a routine follow-up of AGR in the postoperative surveillance will improve prognosis risk stratification of cancer patients. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218117779,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, there remains limited understanding regarding specific citrullinated proteins and their implications in the progression of RA. In this study, we screen and verify insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) as a novel citrullinated protein with significantly elevated citrullinated level in RA. Autoantibodies against citrullinated IGF2BP1 are further detected in serum and synovial fluid samples from RA patients, which are positively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and disease activity score 28 (DAS28). Transcriptomic sequencing and functional verification show that citrullination at the R167 site of IGF2BP1 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) by improving the mRNA stability of Semaphorin 3D (SEMA3D). Experiments in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice, the classical animal model of RA, show that IGF2BP1 R176K point mutation (Igf2bp1R167K/R167K) mice exert reduced inflammatory response, clinical scores, and joint destruction. At a molecular level, citrullination of IGF2BP1 promotes the stability of SEMA3D mRNA by promoting the interaction between IGF2BP1 and its cofactor ELAV-like protein 1 (ELAVL1), thereby promoting the invasiveness of RA-FLSs. In this study, a new citrullinated protein of IGF2BP1 is discovered, and the molecular mechanism of its citrullinated modification promoting the progression of RA disease is elucidated, which provides theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of RA.

Brown and beige adipose tissues are known for their remarkable catabolic capacity, and their ability to diminish blood glucose plasma concentration. Beige adipose tissue can be differentiated from adipose-derived stem cells or through transdifferentiation from white adipocytes. However, the impact of T2D progression on beige adipocytes’ functional capacity remains unclear. Transcriptomic profiling of subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies from healthy normal-weight, obese, prediabetic obese, and obese subjects diagnosed with T2D, reveals a progressive alteration in cellular processes associated with catabolic metabolism, circadian rhythms, thermogenesis-related signaling pathways, cellular stress, and inflammation. MAX is a potential transcription factor that links inflammation with the circadian clock and thermogenesis during the progression of T2D. This study unveils an unrecognized transcriptional circuit that increasingly disrupts subcutaneous adipose tissue oxidative capacity during the progression of T2D.

Yet, a calibrated measurement of the absolute granule pH with organelle specificity is still lacking. To tackle this issue, we use the genetically encoded E1GFP pH reporter inserted into the C-peptide of proinsulin and expressed in Insulinoma 1E cells. Following verification of correct targeting of the E1GFP reporter in the insulin granules, phasor-based Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) is applied to obtain a calibrated and probe-concentration-independent measurement of insulin-granule pH. Our results confirm the acidic nature of insulin granules under maintenance cell culture conditions, with an average luminal pH of ~5.8, and show that acidity is actively maintained, as evidenced by its near-neutralization upon treatment with the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin. Additionally, by exploiting the intrinsic spatial resolution of FLIM, we highlight that granules which are proximal to the plasma membrane are slightly more acidic than those which are distal, a difference preserved even during the early phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion. This study lays the foundations for future investigations of granule pH in physiology and disease. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218859909,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study investigates how phosphorylated PDHA1 drives hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation. We identified eukaryotic elongation factor-1γ (eEF-1γ) as a key binding protein interacting with p-PDHA1 in response to insulin, facilitating their nuclear translocation. Silencing eEF-1γ (si-eEF-1γ) significantly reduced p-PDHA1 and PKM2 levels, highlighting eEF-1γ’s role in stabilizing these proteins. Additionally, eEF-1γ interacts with ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) and p300 acetyltransferase, and its knockdown decreased histone acetylation at H3K9/14, H3K18, and H3K27, along with RBP4 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR (ChIP-PCR) confirmed eEF-1γ association with RBP4 promoter. Functionally, si-eEF-1γ reduced cell proliferation and deceased c-Myc and cyclin D1 protein levels. It also suppressed migration, and altered epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, increasing E-cadherin while reducing ZEB1, snail1, vimentin, and N-cadherin levels. Similarly, RBP4 knockdown with siRNA diminished cell proliferation and migration. In vivo, eEF-1γ knockdown in 4T1 xenografts using siRNA led to reduced tumor mass. These findings highlight eEF-1γ as a crucial driver of insulin-induced tumor progression and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006904936,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

If left untreated, the severe form of LAL-D results in premature death within the first year of life due to failure to thrive and hepatic insufficiency. Weekly systemic injections of recombinant LAL protein, referred as enzyme replacement therapy, is the only available supportive treatment. Method: Here, we characterized a novel Lipa−/− mouse model and developed a curative gene therapy treatment based on the in vivo administration of recombinant (r)AAV8 vector encoding the human LIPA transgene under the control of a hepatocyte-specific promoter. Results: Here we define the minimal rAAV8 dose required to rescue disease lethality and to correct cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation in multiple organs and blood. Finally, using liver transcriptomic and biochemical analysis, we show mitochondrial impairment in Lipa−/− mice and its recovery by gene therapy.

This study assessed the utility of relatively easy-to-measure continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived indices in estimating glucose handling capacities calculated from resource-intensive clamp tests. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 64 individuals without prior diabetes diagnosis. The study performed CGM, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), and hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp tests. We validated CGM-derived indices characteristics using an independent dataset from another country and mathematical models with simulated data. Results: A CGM-derived index reflecting the autocorrelation function of glucose levels (AC_Var) is significantly correlated with clamp-derived disposition index (DI), a well-established measure of glucose handling capacity and predictor of diabetes onset. Multivariate and machine learning models indicate AC_Var’s contribution to predicting clamp-derived DI independent from other CGM-derived indices. The model using CGM-measured glucose standard deviation and AC_Var outperforms models using commonly used diabetes diagnostic indices, such as fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and OGTT measures, in predicting clamp-derived DI. Mathematical simulations also demonstrate the association of AC_Var with DI. Conclusions: CGM-derived indices, including AC_Var, serve as valuable tools for predicting glucose handling capacities in populations without prior diabetes diagnosis.

Methods: Our team developed the Acute Kidney Injury Detection System (AKIDS) to screen for undiagnosed AKDOPT using National Health Insurance MediCloud data and institutional electronic medical records. The criteria for AKDOPT were a >50% change in maximum and minimum serum creatinine levels or a >35% change in corresponding estimated glomerular filtration rate values within the 180 days before an appointed outpatient visit. In this retrospective cohort study, the associations between AKDOPT and composite kidney outcome (CKO; e.g., end-stage kidney disease, a >40% drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or a 2-fold or more increase in serum creatinine), all-cause mortality, and de novo non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD-ND) were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Of 79,838 eligible adult patients screened by the AKIDS, 12,510 (15.7%) have AKDOPT. The adjusted absolute risk increases for 1-year incident CKO, mortality, and de novo CKD-ND for patients with AKDOPT relative to those without are 79.0 (95% confidence interval 78.9–79.1), 25.3 (25.2–25.3), and 54.8 (54.7–54.9) per 1000 patients, respectively.

However, intrinsic factors that counteract vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis remain scarce. Here we identify insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) as a homeostasis-associated molecule that restrains endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis. IGFBP6 levels are significantly reduced in human atherosclerotic arteries and patient serum. Reduction of IGFBP6 in human endothelial cells by siRNA increases inflammatory molecule expression and monocyte adhesion. Conversely, pro-inflammatory effects mediated by disturbed flow (DF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are reversed by IGFBP6 overexpression. Mechanistic investigations further reveal that IGFBP6 executes anti-inflammatory effects directly through the major vault protein (MVP)–c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling axis. Finally, IGFBP6-deficient mice show aggravated diet- and DF-induced atherosclerosis, whereas endothelial-cell-specific IGFBP6-overexpressing mice protect against atherosclerosis. Based on these findings, we propose that reduction of endothelial IGFBP6 is a predisposing factor in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, which can be therapeutically targeted. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217157616,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Through mathematical modeling and subsequent simulation, we are able to design the novel cooking method, namely periodic cooking. Comparison with established egg cooking procedures through a plethora of characterization techniques, including Sensory Analysis, Texture Profile Analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy, confirms the different cooking extents and the different variations in protein denaturation with the novel approach.

Common instrumental methods for molecular size characterization are disadvantageous due to high sample consumption, measurements made in non-physiological conditions, and/or inaccurate size determinations. Capillary Taylor dispersion analysis (TDA) is a molecular sizing method that utilizes nL sample volumes and achieves absolute size determination without calibration or comparison to standards. One key drawback of TDA is that it reports the concentration-weighted average RH, which may be limiting in the analysis of complex sample mixtures. Here, we describe the development of a 3D printed instrument to integrate capillary electrophoresis (CE) separations online with TDA size characterization. Dual laser-induced fluorescence detectors were developed to enable two-channel detection using a single PMT and fluorescence filter set, achieving detection limits for AlexaFluor 532 of 0.6 ± 0.4 nM and 1.1 ± 0.2 nM for detectors 1 and 2, respectively. Joule heating during CE separations was observed to introduce bias in subsequent TDA measurements. The effects of Joule heating were mitigated by integrating a water circulating sheath flow on the portion of the capillary used for CE. The utility of CE-TDA in bioanalysis was demonstrated by standard-free peak identification in the ficin digestion of IgG1. CE-TDA was further applied to characterizing denaturation dynamics of the Group II heat resistant protein apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA), in which RH was observed to increase from 2.3 ± 0.2 nm at 20 °C to 5.2 ± 0.5 nm while heated at at 90 °C, then returned to a quasi-native state with RH = 2.9 ± 0.5 nm after cooling to 20 °C. CE-TDA is a powerful analysis mode with potential to impact various domains of bioanalysis.

Cells optimize their function within tissue microenvironments by expressing specific subsets of RNAs. Advances in cell tagging methods enable spatial understanding of RNA expression when merged with transcriptomics. However, these techniques are currently limited by the spatial resolution of the tagging, the number of RNAs that can be sequenced, and multiplexing to isolate spatially-distinct cells within the same tissue landscape. To address these limitations, we developed CrossSeq, which employs photocrosslinking fluorescent probes and confocal microscopy activation to demarcate user-defined regions of interest on fixed cells for multiplexed spatial transcriptomic analysis. We investigate phenyl azide and diazirine crosslinking scaffolds and define their photoactivity profiles. We then deploy the aryl azide scaffold with three fluorophores for multiplexing on glyoxal fixed cells and analyze the defined populations using flow cytometry. Finally, we apply CrossSeq to investigate an in vitro MDA-MB-231-LM2 metastatic cancer migration model to evaluate changes in gene expression at the migratory cell front versus the exterior population.

Synthesis of 1-3 was accomplished by reacting Hahpa with zinc(II) precursors such as ZnCl2, Zn(NO3)2 6H2O and Zn(ClO4)2 6H2O, respectively, in the presence of NaOH at room temperature. Compounds 1-3 were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, electronic absorption and emission spectroscopy, molar conductivity analysis, and TGA studies. Elemental analysis, molar conductivity analysis, and UV-vis and fluorescence titration results unambiguously confirm the integrity of the compound frameworks. Moreover, the structures of 1-3 were ascertained by density functional theory (DFT) computation using the B3LYP/6-311G level of theory, indicating a distorted square pyramidal geometry around the zinc centers. Furthermore, the anticancer properties of 1-3 were assessed in human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines, revealing a significantly high cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 1.09 to 2.11 mM. They showed high selectivity between the normal and cancer cells despite this potency. The anticancer activity of 1-3 was possibly due to an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), destruction of cell membrane integrity, and DNA damage occurring via nuclear condensation. Electronic absorption spectroscopy, ethidium bromide (EB) displacement assay and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed the binding affinity and binding mode of 1-3 with DNA in a dose-dependent manner. All three compounds were also able to modulate the expression of p53 tumour suppressor protein and exhibited antitumorigenic activity, whereas their activity remained unaltered in the normal cell.

The nanoparticles were synthesized using mussel-extracted selenium with two reducing agents: d-glucose and orange. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed the presence of selenium. The reducing agent and duration influenced the nanoparticle size. Reduction with d-glucose for 1 hour revealed that the particles exhibited an average size of 10 nm. Copper sulfate-induced malformations such as yolk sac and pericardial edema were observed with 25 μg ml−1 of orange-reduced nanoparticles, while d-glucose-reduced nanoparticles mitigated these malformations at 25 μg ml−1. Treatment with stabilized Se-NPs reduced with d-glucose for 30 minutes showed 33% dose-dependent radical scavenging activities, upregulated approximately 2-fold of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase encoding genes and restored homeostasis by decreasing lipid peroxidation (27.32 nmol mg−1 ml−1) and nitric oxide levels (6.71 μM). They also had the potential to restore cognitive properties such as larval movement (93.40 m) without altering larval behaviour.

One of the major issues associated with TCS is its limited solubility in aqueous media, which can reduce its effectiveness against bacteria. In this study, we enhanced the aqueous solubility and antibacterial activity of TCS by using a re-dispersible emulsion powder stabilized with gold nanoparticles (GNPs). The developed formulation (TCS/PEG-B/GNPs) demonstrated the ability to dissolve in aqueous media and provided good stability. An antibacterial investigation was conducted using drug-resistant bacterial strains, Escherichia coli (E. coli) BAA-1161 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as model bacteria. The results showed that TCS/PEG-B/GNPs had the highest antibacterial activity. The MRSA strain demonstrated greater susceptibility to TCS (both TCS alone and TCS in the formulation) than E. coli BAA-1161. The cytotoxicity assay was also conducted in THP-1 cells and it was found that the viability of THP-1 cells treated with a 5× dilution of TCS/PEG-B/GNPs was higher than 80%. Altogether, our study proposes a novel approach to overcome the solubility concerns of TCS. These results demonstrated an increase in TCS's solubility and efficacy, which holds great promise for future applications. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215842405,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Mohan A.; Ramanan S.R.,Surface imprinted microhelical magnetic polymer nanocomposite fibers for targeted lysozyme separation,2025,Nanoscale Advances,10.1039/d4na01041h,"Magnetic microhelical structures have recently drawn attention as microswimmers capable of mimicking bacterial propulsion in the low Reynolds number regime. Such structures can be used in microfluidic bioseparation or targeted delivery and their interaction with proteins is extremely important. In this study we fabricated silica coated magnetic microhelices resembling artificial bacterial flagella like structures via electrospinning magnetite nanoparticle incorporated polystyrene nanocomposite solution followed by silica sol coating. Two model proteins, Lysozyme (Lyz) and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), were used for protein imprinting along with a polydopamine layer on the magnetic microhelical substrates. The adsorption mechanism of lysozyme on the molecularly imprinted support system was analyzed using adsorption model fitting (Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin). Adsorption capacity, selective binding and imprinting factor values were calculated for both imprinted (Lyz and BSA) and non-imprinted samples. A significantly higher adsorption capacity was obtained compared to previously reported studies. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002691737,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Chen S.; Triki M.; Pinto Carneiro S.; Merkel O.M.,A novel micelleplex for tumour-targeted delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 against KRAS-mutated lung cancer,2025,Nanoscale,10.1039/d4nr03471f,"CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a highly effective and customizable genome editing tool, holding significant promise for the treatment of KRAS mutations in lung cancer. In this study, we introduce a novel micelleplex, named C14-PEI, designed to co-deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA efficiently to excise the mutated KRAS allele in lung cancer cells. C14-PEI is synthesised from 1,2-epoxytetradecane and branched PEI 600 Da via a ring-opening reaction. The resulting C14-PEI has a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of approximately 20.86 ± 0.15 mg L−1, indicating its ability to form stable micelles at low concentrations. C14-PEI efficiently encapsulates mRNA into micelleplexes through electrostatic interactions. When the mass ratio is 8 (w/w 8), the C14-PEI formulation exhibits conducive properties, which showed encapsulation efficiency of eGFP mRNA at 99% and led to a 130-fold increase in eGFP expression in A549 cells compared to untreated cells, demonstrating the robust delivery and expression capability of the micelleplexes. Importantly, toxicity tests using intracellular reduction of a tetrazolium salt revealed no significant cytotoxicity, underscoring the biocompatibility of C14-PEI. C14-PEI also shows high efficiency in co-encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA, as confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. At an sgRNA to Cas9 mRNA molar ratio of 10, the micelleplexes successfully mediate the cutting of mutated KRAS with an indel efficiency exceeding 60%, as determined by the T7 Endonuclease I (T7EI) assay. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) further demonstrates that the gene editing efficiency, measured by edited gene copies, is 48.5% in the w/w 4 group and 37.8% in the w/w 8 group. Treatment with C14-PEI micelleplexes containing Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA targeting the KRAS G12S mutation significantly impairs the migration capability of A549 cells and increases apoptosis rates. These findings suggest that C14-PEI effectively disrupts KRAS signalling pathways, leading to reduced tumor cell proliferation and enhanced cell death. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000752141,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, its application is limited by severe side effects and drug resistance. The combination of platinum-based chemotherapeutics with EGFR inhibitors has shown remarkable synergism in clinical treatment. To enhance the tolerability of this combination, we designed a novel multi-action oxaliplatin-based platinum(IV) complex with an EGFR-inhibiting moiety (KP2749). KP2749 releases two independent cytotoxic agents upon reduction: oxaliplatin and the EGFR inhibitor KP2187, which was selected for its strong intrinsic fluorescence that became quenched upon complexation to metal ions. In particular, KP2749 demonstrated high stability and specific KP2187 release, with quenched fluorescent properties in its intact form, facilitating the investigation of its intracellular reduction. Notably, by exploiting its fluorescence, we demonstrated that intact KP2749 itself exhibited EGFR-inhibitory properties. Furthermore, subsequent experiments indicated that our complex was able to overcome resistance to oxaliplatin and EGFR inhibitors in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. These effects were not only based on EGFR inhibition and DNA damage, but also improved cellular drug uptake. Finally, in silico docking analysis confirmed that the intact KP2749 complex had EGFR-binding properties, which were different from free KP2187. Consequently, these data suggested that the coordination of EGFR inhibitors to metal cores (like platinum) allow the fine-tuning of their EGFR-targeting properties. In conclusion, this study not only presents a new potential anticancer drug but also offers a novel fluorescent tool to study the intracellular drug release kinetics of platinum(IV) complexes. © the Partner Organisations 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214680452,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

To address this, two proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and gelatin were used to form curcumin-protein nanocomplexes using a charge-switch method, by mixing oppositely charged curcumin and proteins. Complexation with BSA and gelatin increased the curcumin solubility to 391.77 (±15.70) μg mL−1 and 143.64 (±2.29) μg mL−1 respectively, and the loading amount (LA) of curcumin to 21.36% and 15.57%, respectively. Moreover, enhanced bioaccessibility, and antioxidant and antimicrobial properties were observed after complexation. After complexation, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of curcumin decreased by eightfold against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, more than eightfold against Vibrio harveyi, and twofold against Bacillus cereus and Streptococcus iniae, which are food and aquaculture related pathogens.

Where blood gas analysers enable patient monitoring, starter cultures in cheese manufacturing are still monitored using conventional pH electrodes. Here, we present a homogeneous multiwell plate sensor for monitoring pH, with the same sensitivity as a pH electrode. The homogenous sensor operates in small liquid samples and uses two components: a pH responsive triangulenium dye on a polystyrene nanoparticle, and a freely diffusing commercial reference dye. Sensor measurements were made in triplicate to investigate and document the performance and robustness of the individual components, before we moved on to investigate the multiwell plate sensor design. The pH sensor was first tested in cuvettes, before moving to microwells and smaller volumes. The target is to monitor pH in IVF cultures, and the sensor proved to be operational in the pH range found in in vitro fertilisation buffers, but the references dye was shown not to be suitable for sensors.

This study thermodynamic properties, solubility measurements and spectrofluorometric method were used for investigating the interactions between fluconazole (FCZ) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs). Five choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were synthesized. Each DES was prepared by combining choline chloride (a hydrogen bond acceptor, HBA) with a different hydrogen bond donor (HBD): oxalic acid (OX), malonic acid (MA), ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol (G), or urea (U). Subsequently, the interactions between fluconazole (FCZ) and these synthesized DESs were investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy at a temperature of 298.15 K. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a strong interaction between fluconazole (FCZ) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs). This was evident from the significant quenching of FCZ's intrinsic fluorescence upon DES addition. The association constant and binding sites were determined. Among the tested DESs, the choline chloride-oxalic acid mixture exhibited the strongest interaction with FCZ. Furthermore, the solubility of FCZ in DES-water mixtures studied at a temperature range of (298.15 to 313.15) K was found to increase with increasing DES concentration. The solubility data were accurately fitted using the e-NRTL and Wilson thermodynamic models. To gain deeper insights, conductor-like screening model (COSMO) calculations were performed on the studied systems. The obtained surface cavity volume and dielectric solvation energy provide valuable information about the intermolecular interactions.

Herein, we present a two-dimensional orthogonal fluorescence and chemiluminescence design strategy for the probe DCM-SA, which is sequentially activated by albumin-mediated hydrolysis, exhibiting light-up fluorescence and photo-induced cycloaddition generating chemiluminescence, enabling orthogonal signal amplification for discrimination of subtle differences between similar proteins. By orthogonalizing these dual-mode signals, a two-dimensional work curve of fluorescence and chemiluminescence is established to distinguish and quantify similar proteins HSA and BSA. Importantly, the dual-mode signals of DCM-SA exhibit contrary incremental trends towards HSA and BSA. Molecular docking and femtosecond transient absorbance spectroscopy reveal that the lower KD value of DCM-SA with HSA and the longer excited-state lifetime of DCM-SA with BSA underlie the distinct dual-mode responses. Using two-dimensional orthogonal signals, for the first time, we precisely measure the HSA/BSA ratio in mixed serum. This method facilitates rapid blood source identification and trace HSA quantitation in human urine.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) offer multiple important advantages for drug delivery, including stability, protection of active substances, and sustained release capabilities. However, tracking their structural integrity and dynamic behaviour in complex biological environments remains challenging. Here, we report the development of a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-enabled LNP platform that achieves unprecedented sensitivity and precision in monitoring nanoparticle disintegration. The FRET-based LNPs were prepared using nanoprecipitation, encapsulating high levels of 3,30- dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) and 1,10-dioctadecyl- 3,3,30,30-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) fluorophores as the donor and acceptors, respectively. The resulting LNPs had a mean diameter of 114 _ 19 nm with a distinct FRET signal. An optimal energy transfer efficiency of 0.98 and an emission quantum yield of 0.13 were achieved at 11.1% fluorophore loading in the LNPs, balancing efficient energy transfer and minimal aggregation-induced quenching. Using the FRET reporting, three dissociation stages of FRET LNPs were observed: solvation, indicated by an increased emission intensity; swelling and partial dissolution, evidenced by changes in emission maxima and mean size; and complete dissociation, confirmed by emission solely from DiO and the absence of particles. Testing the nanoparticles in live cells (telomerase-immortalised human corneal epithelial cells, hTCEpi cells) revealed a direct link to the disappearance of the FRET signal with the dissociation of FRET NPs. The nanoparticles initially exhibited a strong extracellular FRET signal, which diminished after cellular internalisation. This suggests that the LNPs disintegrate after entering the cells.

Current research suggests that tendon injuries are affected by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory responses, and type III collagen deposition. These factors lead to an imbalance between extrinsic and intrinsic tendon healing and are the main reasons for the occurrence of peritendinous adhesions. In this study, we constructed a carrier using a polyvinyl alcohol/polyethylene glycol (PVA/PEG) dual network hydrogel and loaded it with zeolite imidazolium ester framework-8@CeO2 nano-enzymes (ZIF-8@CeO2) to form a nano-enzyme-functionalized hydrogel (PVA/PEG/ZIF-8@CeO2) therapeutic system. The surface of PVA/PEG/ZIF-8@CeO2 is rich in hydrophilic hydroxyl groups that form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, creating a hydrated layer that inhibits fibrin adsorption and fibroblast adhesion, reduces the impact of exogenous healing, and reduces the formation of adhesions. Similarly, the loaded ZIF-8@CeO2 has catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, which can effectively remove the excessive ROS in the injured tendon, down-regulate the inflammatory response, enhance the tendon differentiation of tendon stem cells, promote intrinsic healing, and ultimately promote the repair of injured tendons. Furthermore, the system can accelerate the transition from inflammation to repair and remodeling in the tendon healing process.

The interplay between Aβ and Cyt c is thus, crucial in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology, where oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are central features.

This H2O2 produced can oxidize neurotransmitters and this process is catalysed by the oxidized Cu-Aβ. Here spectroscopic analyses reveal that reduced Cu-Aβ transfers electron to oxidized Cyt c, which mitigates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reduced Cu-Aβ species. Thus, Cyt c can exhibit a protective role against ROS generation by Cu-Aβ. On the other hand, the oxidation of reduced Cyt c by H2O2 is significantly accelerated in the presence of Cu-Aβ, highlighting the thus far unknown intrinsic Cyt c peroxidase type activity of oxidized Cu-Aβ.

An integrated computational and experimental approach was employed, combining DFT calculations and molecular docking simulations to analyze quercetin's interactions with the MnFe2O4 surface across (011), (101), and (100) facets, alongside in vitro studies to assess drug loading and release, biocompatibility, and cytotoxicity on 4T1 cells. Molecular docking showed favorable binding energies between quercetin and BSA (−5.17 kcal mol−1 with Subdomain IIA), demonstrating that quercetin, even when bound to the BSA coating, retained strong interactions with the oxide surface. Reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis revealed facet-dependent adsorption mechanisms, correlating binding affinity towards Mn (through oxygen-containing functional groups) with steric interactions shown as red areas on the RDG plot. Analysis unveiled the interactions and structural features of each facet of the drug complex. Experimentally, the TEM imaging revealed the nanoparticles to possess a spherical morphology with an average diameter of around 7 nanometers and the average size of nanoparticles by DLS is 85.27 ± 0.26 nm with a PDI of 0.25. The BSA coating improved drug loading to 27.5% and resulted in a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on 4T1 tumor cells.

Ghosal S.; Bag S.; Bhowmik S.,Poly(vinyl chloride) microplastics induce structural and functional alterations in myoglobin,2025,RSC Advances,10.1039/d5ra02355f,"Microplastics (MPs) pollution represents a global concern for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and public health. The poly(vinyl chloride) Microplastics (PVC-MPs) are one of the dominant pollutants in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. Myoglobin (Mb) is an important intracellular oxygen-binding protein found in mammals' hearts and skeletal muscles. Mb act as an oxygen transporter and storage material in muscle cells. Due to molecular inertness and excellent accessibility to organisms, PVC-MPs are degraded slowly in the atmosphere and can accumulate in the mammalian bloodstream, posing major health risks. In this study, under simulated physiological conditions, the interaction between the emerging pollutant PVC-MPs and Mb was analysed using multispectroscopic studies. From these studies, it has been found that PVC-MPs may bind to Mb during transportation and metabolic activities. Because of their tiny size, PVC-MPs may bind with Mb once they enter the bloodstream, altering the structure and physiological function of Mb. These results also suggest that electrostatic forces were the primary factor behind the interaction between PVC-MPs and Mb. Additionally, the results further showed that PVC-MPs significantly altered the microenvironment and secondary structure of Mb, which decreased the α-helix. This study clarifies the possible molecular toxicity of PVC-MPs in addition to provide crucial insight into the intermolecular interaction between PVC-MPs and Mb. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012537977,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Therefore, new treatment options that specifically target tumor cells will inevitably improve the therapeutic toolkit for various cancers. In this regard, a sequence of acrylamide-PABA hybrids 4a-j was synthesized, and their formation was confirmed via spectral and elemental analyses. The compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 (breast), HepG2 (liver) and a normal health breast cell line (MCF-10A). Among the series, acrylamide-PABA analog 4j with a furan group in the acrylamide moiety was the most potent anti-proliferative member with a notable IC50 value (IC50 = 1.83 μM) against MCF-7 cells. Compound 4j's anti-tubulin activity and apoptosis-promoting properties were the cause of its anti-proliferative inhibitory mechanism. Compound 4j promoted apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by raising the expression of apoptotic markers, such as p53, Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase 9, with respect to the untreated control. The molecular docking study of compound 4j revealed a nice fitting into the active site of tubulin. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007677924,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

All the novel coumarin-1,2,4-triazole hybrids 14(a-h) and phenylacetamide linked coumarin derivatives 17(a-h) were synthesized by following a standard procedure in good to excellent yields i.e., 51-75% for 14(a-h) and 62-82% for 17(a-h). The synthesized derivatives were subjected to in silico modelling to evaluate their anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential, targeting Mpro (main protease), Nsp15 (nonstructural protein) and spike protein. Among all, compounds 14b and 14c expressed excellent potency against their respective targets with corresponding binding affinities of −9.5 kcal mol−1 (6VWW), −9.2 kcal mol−1 (6Y84), and −8.6 (6WPT) kcal mol−1, even better than all standards i.e., chloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and nirmatrelvir. The stability of the potent compounds (14b and 14c) was further supported by a 100 ns MD simulation, emphasizing their potent and stable interactions with the main protease, endoribonuclease, and spike protein.

However, its short half-life, poor water-solubility, and low stability in vivo hinder its use. The development of injectable controlled release systems for ATRA delivery can potentially address these challenges. Building on a poly(caprolactone-co-lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(caprolactone-co-lactide) (PCLA-PEG-PCLA) triblock copolymer system that undergoes thermo-responsive gelation at 37 °C, we explore and compare different approaches to stabilize the gels through covalent bonding. The attempted cross-linking of methacrylate end-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA through thiol-Michael addition reactions using small molecule and 4-arm-PEG thiols led to precipitation rather than gelation. However, azide end-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA was gelled using 5 kg mol−1 4-arm-PEG with terminal dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBAC) groups by strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition. This hydrogel was then compared with previously reported methacrylate end-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA hydrogels cross-linked by free radical chemistry, as well as non-covalently cross-linked hydrogels. The azide-alkyne hydrogels exhibited properties intermediate between the free radical and non-covalently cross-linked gels. Incorporation of ATRA substantially disrupted the free radical cross-linking, but imparted only modest changes in the azide-alkyne gels. ATRA was released over about two weeks. The proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells in the presence of ATRA-loaded and control azide-alkyne gels was investigated. The ATRA-loaded gel released active drug, while the unloaded gel did not affect proliferation. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006520195,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Evidence suggests that children with an EA-SFK may have a higher risk of future kidney disease compared with those with a C-SFK, but the precise underlying mechanisms need further investigation. C-SFK was induced by fetal UNX at 100 days gestation (term=150 days) in male sheep fetuses, and a sham procedure was performed. At approximately one month of age, EA-SFK was induced by UNX in male lambs. At eight months of age, total kidney weight was similar in all groups due to marked hypertrophy in the C-SFK and EA-SFK groups. Blood pressure was similar in EA-SFK and sham groups but ~12 mmHg higher in the C-SFK group compared with sham. Compared with the sham group, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was ~9% less in the EA-SFK group and ~26% less in the C-SFK. GFR was ~23% higher in EA-SFK compared with the C-SFK group. Albuminuria was ~67% higher in C-SFK sheep but similar in the EA-SFK group compared with sham sheep. However, like the C-SFK group, the renal blood flow response to nitric oxide blockade was attenuated in the EA-SFK group compared with sham. In conclusion, long-term studies are needed to determine whether the higher hyperfiltration and disturbed vasodilator balance observed in EA-SFK sheep will cause an accelerated decline in renal function with aging. © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000796071,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Especially the protein and fluid interactions with the nitrocellulose membrane structure are yet to be fully investigated, which affect the fluid and protein distribution of the test and control lines differently due to different adsorptive properties of fluids and proteins. Therefore, the relationship between fluid spread and protein distribution, respectively, and structure needs systematic evaluation. Two procedures were developed based on passive adsorption of complementary fluorescent dyes to investigate these phenomena. These procedures enabled three-dimensional visualization of the membrane structure, fluid as well as the protein spreading, respectively. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was applied after depositing picoliter and nanoliter volumes of the printing buffers containing fluorophore-labeled proteins (immunoglobulin G) and Oregon Green™ 488 onto the membrane using a high precision micro dispenser. The resulting data were correlated with the membrane's tortuosity and permeability. Inverse-proportional dependencies for the lateral spread of the fluid and protein adsorption with the structural parameters were observed. Additionally, surfactants [polysorbate 80 (PS80) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), both at 0.1%] were added individually to the buffers, and the spread of the liquids was evaluated. Both surfactants increase the similarities between fluid and protein shape compared to the reference data. While SDBS increases the general lateral spread, PS80 does increase the penetration depth of the protein into the membrane, which could lead to reduced signal in LFAs. © 2025 Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000033880,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Inspired by TARE, we study the injection of fluid via a catheter in an idealized liver vasculature through experiments and lattice Boltzmann simulations. First, we validate the simulations using in vitro experiments of dye injected through a catheter. Then, we investigate the impact of catheter injection velocity on the distribution of injected fluid. The sensitivity of the distributions to changes in flow rate is low at catheter flow rates Q c ≤ 6 mL min − 1 and Q c ≥ 11 mL min − 1 , while in the intermediate regime, changes in flow rate of only 2 ml/min lead to changes in distribution of more than 50%. This is shown to originate from changes in the flow field in the first bifurcation. Specifically, the sensitivity to flow rate becomes large as the jet breakdown length approaches the distance to the first bifurcation. Our work represents a first step toward a fundamental understanding of the effect of injection velocity in TARE and similar applications. © 2025 Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002733636,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

To address inequities and optimise care, Te Korowai Hauora o Hauraki, an Iwi Māori health provider, established the 'Piki te Ora service' to support its five rural clinics by providing culturally safe, multidisciplinary support for patients with T2D. Aim This study aimed to undertake a service review, describing and evaluating the available clinical data, of the Piki te Ora service. Methods Patients enrolled in the Piki te Ora service between January 2021 and March 2024 were invited to have their data (sociodemographic, HbA1c, cholesterol and blood pressure) included in the review. Frequency and mode of health care/patient contact were also explored. Results A total of 112 patients were contacted and 64 (mean age 58years, 62.5% Māori) consented to data review. Over 6months, patients in the Piki te Ora service were contacted an average of 9.5 times, with phone calls being the predominant mode of contact. Median HbA1c levels significantly decreased by 16.0mmol/mol at 6months post enrolment in the Piki te Ora service (P =0.011) but no significant changes were observed in cholesterol or blood pressure. Discussion The Piki te Ora service appears to provide effective support for T2D management, particularly glycaemic control, however more clinical data is needed to evaluate its effectiveness.

Accurate prognostic evaluation is essential in CRC patient management. This study investigates the prognostic significance of red blood cell count (RBC) and Onodera’s prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) in resectable CRC patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 210 CRC patients undergoing radical resection (January 2015–January 2017) assessed clinical and hematological factors, including RBC, albumin, hemoglobin, and OPNI. A novel comprehensive biomarker, R-OPNI, combining preoperative RBC with OPNI, was introduced. Correlations with patient survival were analyzed, and R-OPNI’s independent prognostic value was assessed through univariate and multivariate Cox models. Predictive ability was compared to other factors using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method. Results: Higher RBC levels (≥ 3.9 × 1012/L) and elevated OPNI were associated with significantly improved overall survival. Lower R-OPNI scores (0 or 1) indicated notably poorer survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed R-OPNI’s independent prognostic significance (HR: 0.273, 95% CI: 0.098–0.763, p = 0.013). R-OPNI (AUC = 0.732) demonstrated superior predictive value compared to individual prognostic factors. Conclusion: R-OPNI emerges as a robust, independent prognostic predictor for resectable CRC patients, emphasizing the importance of assessing preoperative nutritional status. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206112738,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study aimed to determine the role of aggressive intravenous hydration with lactated Ringer’s solution at a specific volume with 20% human albumin before ERCP in reducing the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Methods: This study was a single-centre randomized clinical trial. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: those who received aggressive intravenous hydration with 20% human albumin and lactated Ringer's solution (intervention group), and those who received standard-volume intravenous hydration with lactated Ringer's solution (control group). The primary endpoint was post-ERCP pancreatitis. Participants and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Comparison was performed using the chi-square, the Fisher’s exact, the Student’s t, or the Mann–Whitney U tests, where appropriate. Results: Of 300 randomized participants, 149 and 144 participants from the intervention and control group were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference in the post-ERCP pancreatitis rate (n = 10; 6.7% versus n = 9; 6.3%, P = 0.873) between the intervention and control groups. High-risk procedures (that is pancreatic duct wiring, pancreatic duct injection, precut sphincterotomy, and balloon dilation of the ampulla) were significantly associated with post-ERCP pancreatitis compared with low-risk procedures (n = 15; 15% versus n = 4; 2.1%, P < 0.001). In the high-risk procedures population, the intervention and control groups had increased post-ERCP pancreatitis rates (P = 0.716). Two participants in each group developed pulmonary congestion. Conclusion: Aggressive peri-ERCP intravenous hydration with lactated Ringer's solution combined with 50 ml of 20% human albumin did not prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis.

Sarcopenia, defined as reduced muscle strength and muscle quantity, has been seldom assessed in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. The aim of this study was to examine functional compromise in emergency laparotomy using sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and frailty parameters and evaluate impacts on functional and patient-centred outcomes. Methods: Patients aged greater than or equal to 55 years who underwent emergency laparotomy and preoperative computed tomography (CT) at two hospitals in New Zealand between February 2022 and October 2023 were included in a prospective database. Sarcopenia was measured using the SARC-F questionnaire, isokinetic dynamometry to measure hand grip strength, and skeletal muscle quantity according to CT. Myosteatosis was determined using CT and frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale. Predictors for rehabilitation, days alive and out of hospital at 90 days, and risk of not returning home were analysed using relative risk and proportional means regression. Secondary outcomes were 3- and 6-month mortality and inpatient morbidity defined using the Clavien–Dindo classification. Results: A total of 101 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy during the study interval were analysed; 21.6% of participants had sarcopenia, 34.7% had myosteatosis, and 24.8% were living with frailty. Muscle strength parameters (low grip strength and a positive SARC-F questionnaire) had significant relationships with primary outcomes. Low grip strength (less than 27 kg for male patients and less than 16 kg for female patients) was most significant for risk of admission for rehabilitation (adjusted risk ratio 5.48 (95% c.i. 2.03 to 14.82)). A positive SARC-F questionnaire (an overall score of greater than or equal to 4 out of 10) was most significant for not returning home (adjusted risk ratio 8.26 (95% c.i. 1.81 to 37.76)). Isolated low muscle quantity (less than 52.4 cm2/m2 for male patients and less than 38.5 cm2/m2 for female patients) demonstrated no relationship. Being frail was most significant for a reduced number of days alive and out of hospital at 90 days (−13.4% compared with non-frail participants (95% c.i. −24.3% to −0.8%)). Sarcopenia and low grip strength were the only parameters to demonstrate a relationship with 3- and 6-month mortality. Conclusion: Sarcopenia and frailty parameters are major determinants of functional compromise and predict adverse outcomes after emergency laparotomy. Muscle strength is more important than mass, and measurable without imaging, streamlining its clinical application. © The Author(s) 2025.

These calculations do not account for the variation seen in preanalytical conditions in routine practice or CVI in patients presenting for treatment. As a result, the RCVs may not reflect routine practice or align with clinicians’ experiences. We propose a novel RCV approach based on routine patient data that is potentially more clinically relevant. METHODS: This study used the refineR algorithm to determine RCVs using serial patient data extracted from a local Laboratory Information System (LIS). The model was applied to biomarkers with a range of result ratio distributions varying from normal to log-normal. Results were compared against conventional formula-based RCVs using CVI estimates from a state-of-the-art biological variation study. Monte Carlo simulations were also used to validate the LIS data approach. RESULTS: The RCVs estimated from LIS data were: 11-deoxycortisol (men): −70%/+196%, 17-hydroxyproges-terone (men): −49%/+100%, albumin: −10%/+11%, androstenedione (men): −47%/+96%, cortisol (men): −54%/+51%, cortisone (men): −32%/+51%, creatinine: −16%/+14%, phosphate (women): −23%/+29%, phosphate (men): −27%/+29%, testosterone (men): −38%/+60%. The formula-based RCV estimates showed similar but slightly lower results, and the Monte Carlo simulations confirmed the applicability of the new approach. CONCLUSIONS: RCVs may be estimated from patient results without prior assumptions about the shape of the ratios between serial results. Laboratories can determine RCVs based on local practice and population. © Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214089523,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Ahmed H.; Böhmdorfer M.; Jäger W.; Zeitlinger M.,Insights into interspecies protein binding variability using clindamycin as an example,2025,Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy,10.1093/jac/dkae412,"Background: In the preclinical development of new drugs, animal models are often employed to predict their efficacy in humans, relying on translational pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies. We performed in vitro experiments focusing on the comparison of plasma protein binding (PPB) and bacterial growth dynamics of clindamycin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent, across a range of drug concentrations and plasma environments. Methods: Human, bovine and rat plasma were used for determining PPB of clindamycin at various antibiotic concentrations in buffer and media containing 20% to 70% plasma or pure plasma using ultrafiltration (UF) and equilibrium dialysis (ED). Also bacterial growth and time–kill assays were performed in Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB) containing various percentages of plasma. Results: Protein binding of clindamycin correlated well between UF and ED. Notably, clindamycin exhibited substantially lower protein binding to rat plasma compared with human and bovine plasma. Staphylococcus aureus growth was significantly reduced in 70% human, bovine, and rat plasma after 4, 8 and 24 h compared with standard MHB. Time–kill data demonstrated that bacterial counts at both 20% and 70% plasmas were less when compared with MHB at drug concentrations lower than MIC after 4 and 8 h of incubation. For rat plasma, the difference was maintained over 24 h of incubation. Furthermore, a complete bacterial killing at 16 mg/L was observed after 24 h in 20% and 70% human and bovine plasma, but not for rat plasma. Conclusions: Recognizing interspecies differences in PB might be essential for optimizing the translational relevance of preclinical studies. © The Author(s) 2024.

Yet, studies had limitations regarding sample size, follow-up, and contemporary treatments. We evaluated the risk of T2D after BC overall, by cancer treatment, and compared with a matched cohort of cancer-free women. Methods: We assembled a population-based cohort of early-stage BC patients aged 30 years or more diagnosed during 1996-2021 in Denmark. We created a comparison cohort of 5 cancer- and T2D-free women for each BC patient, matched 6 months after BC diagnosis date on age and region. We followed both cohorts until T2D diagnosis, emigration, death, or December 31, 2022. We computed 5-year cumulative incidences and used Cox models to calculate time-varying adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of T2D. Results: Among 74 526 BC survivors and 372 630 matched cancer-free women, 5-year cumulative incidences of T2D were 3.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.7 to 3.9) and 3.3% (95% CI = 3.3 to 3.4), respectively. The aHR of T2D was elevated but attenuated over follow-up (aHR5-years = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.25, and aHR15-years = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.12). Adjuvant endocrine therapy (aHR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.19), aromatase inhibitors (aHR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.32), and less so tamoxifen (aHR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.99 to 1.11), were associated with elevated risk of T2D in women with BC vs cancer-free women. Among BC patients, chemotherapy (aHR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.17) and radiation therapy (right-sided aHR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.27 and left-sided aHR = 1.24, 95CI = 1.15 to 1.33) were associated with increased T2D risk. Conclusion: BC was associated with excess risk of T2D, although of lower magnitude than previously reported. The excess risk was temporary and related to BC treatment but could also be influenced by obesity and heightened T2D diagnostic activity. © The Author(s) 2024.

One possibility is differences in susceptibility to metallomic dysregulation. A previous study of the PDD brain identified substantive perturbations in metal levels, including severe multiregional decreases in Cu. The current work uses the same methods to ascertain whether this metallomic dysfunction is also present in the PD brain. To do this, tissue from 9 PD cases free of cognitive decline and 15 equivalent controls was obtained from 7 brain regions. Levels of Na, Mg, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Se were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine any potential confounder effects. Results were compared with those previously obtained for PDD. It was found that decreased Cu in the medulla was the only statistically significant case-control difference observed in the PD brain; this contrasts markedly with the widespread metallic dysfunction observed in PDD. PD and PDD cases were well separated by PCA analysis. In the PD cohort, tau Braak stage correlated with Cu concentrations in several regions, but these correlations were not retained when including PDD cases. There is a marked difference in the metallomic profiles of PD and PDD, with an almost complete lack of metallic involvement observed in the former. This resistance to metallomic dysfunction may contribute to resilience against cognitive impairment in individuals with PD who do not develop dementia.  © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000267255,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We use acoustic force spectroscopy to characterize the dynamics of transcription elongation in ternary elongation complexes (ECs) of RNAP in the presence of Stl at a single-molecule level. We found that Stl induces long-lived stochastic pauses while the instantaneous velocity of transcription between the pauses is unaffected. Stl enhances the short-lived pauses associated with an off-pathway early paused state intermediates of the RNAP nucleotide addition cycle. Unexpectedly, we found that transcript cleavage factors GreA and GreB, which were thought to be Stl competitors, do not alleviate the Stl-induced pausing; instead, they synergistically increase transcription inhibition by Stl. This is the first known instance of a transcriptional factor enhancing antibiotic activity. We propose a structural model of the EC-Gre-Stl complex that explains the observed Stl activities and provides insight into possible cooperative action of secondary channel factors and other antibiotics binding at the Stl pocket. These results offer a new strategy for high-throughput screening for prospective antibacterial agents. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214804433,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We show that the lack of BLM causes a decrease in the autophosphorylation of ATM in mice mammary glands, which have lost one or both copies of BLM. In isogenic human cells, the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway was dampened in the absence of BLM, which negatively affected the recruitment of DDR factors onto the chromatin, thereby indicating a direct role of BLM in augmenting DDR. Mechanistically, this was due to the BLM-dependent dissociation of inactive ATM dimers into active monomers. Fragmentation analysis of BLM followed by kinase assays revealed a 20-mer BLM peptide (91–110 aa), sufficient to enhance ATM-dependent p53 phosphorylation. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BLM at Thr99 within BLM (91–110) peptide enhanced ATM kinase activity due to its interaction with NBS1 and causing ATM monomerization. Delivery of phosphomimetic T99E counterpart of BLM (91–110 aa) peptide led to ATM activation followed by restoration of the DDR even in the absence of ionizing irradiation (both in cells and in BLM knockout mice), indicating its role as a DDR agonist, which can be potentially used to prevent the initiation of neoplastic transformation. © The Author(s) 2025.

We have developed the Beta Structure Selection (BeStSel) method (PNAS, 112, E3095), which solves the main problem of protein CD spectroscopy - namely, the spectral variability of β-structures. The BeStSel web server utilizes this method to provide tools to the community for CD spectrum analysis. BeStSel uniquely provides information on eight secondary structure components, including parallel β-structure and antiparallel β-sheets with three different twist groups. It outperforms all available methods in accuracy and information content, and is also able to predict protein folds down to the topology/homology level of the CATH classification. The algorithm has been further developed, and the accuracy of the estimation of the secondary structure elements is improved by 0.7% as an average on the reference dataset. A new module of the web server calculates protein stability from the thermal denaturation profile followed by CD. Secondary structure calculations of uploaded PDB and mmcif files support the experimental verification of MD simulations and AlphaFold models by CD spectroscopy. Well-proven modules for disorder-order classification and extinction coefficient calculation continue to work.

The impact of type Ⅰ and type Ⅱ DM on adverse postoperative outcomes, mortality, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and increased in-hospital costs following cervical fusion surgery remains unclear in the past decade. This study aims to determine the specific effect of different classifications of DM on postoperative complications in patients experiencing cervical fusion surgery. METHOD: Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was acquired between 2010 and 2019. Patients experiencing cervical fusion were included and classified as having type I DM, type II DM, or neither. Patient demographics, hospital characteristics, operative variables, comorbidities, complications, and other postoperative outcomes were assessed. Propensity score matching analysis was used to balance baseline differences. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were employed to determine the risk of postoperative outcomes in patients with different classifications of DM. RESULT: A total of 267 174 cervical spinal fusions were identified (224 255 were patients without DM, 670 patients had type I DM, and 42 249 patients had type II DM). After propensity score matching, the multivariate analysis of non-DM and type I DM patients shows a significant difference in pneumonia ( P =0.020). However, type Ⅱ DM served as an independent predictor of an increased risk of acute cerebrovascular disease ( P =0.001), acute myocardial infarction ( P =0.014), pneumonia ( P =0.045), continuous trauma ventilation ( P =0.016), chest pain ( P <0.001), urinary tract infection ( P <0.001), transfusion ( P =0.005) and dysphagia ( P =0.013), prolonged LOS ( P <0.001), and increased costs ( P =0.008). CONCLUSION: Using non-DM patients as a reference, the type II DM group demonstrated a higher risk of postoperative complications than the type I DM group among patients receiving cervical fusion surgery. This vital distinction could enhance risk stratification and guidance for patients diagnosed with DM before cervical fusion surgery. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

However, its role in cirrhosis has not been examined especially in low GFR. We analyzed the performance of CKD-EPI 2021 compared to other equations with protocol-measured GFR (mGFR) in cirrhosis. We analyzed 2090 unique adult patients with cirrhosis undergoing protocol GFR measurements using iothalamate clearance from 1985 to 2015 when listed for liver transplantation at Baylor University in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas. Using mGFR as a reference standard, the CKD-EPI 2021 was compared to CKD-EPI 2012, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-4, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-6, Royal Free Hospital, and GFR Assessment in Liver disease overall and in certain subgroups (ascites, mGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, diagnosis, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and gender). We examined bias (difference between eGFR and mGFR), accuracy (p30: eGFR within ± 30% of mGFR) and agreement between eGFR and mGFR categories. CKD-EPI 2021 had the second lowest bias across the entire range of GFR after GFR Assessment in Liver disease (6.6 vs. 4.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively, p < 0.001). The accuracy of CKD-EPI 2021 was similar to CKD-EPI 2012 (p30 = 67.8% vs. 67.9%, respectively) which was higher than the other equations (p < 0.001). It had a similar performance in patients with ascites, by diagnoses, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease subgroups, by gender, and in non-Black patients. However, it had a relatively higher overestimation in mGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 than most equations (18.5 mL/min/1.73m2, p < 0.001). Specifically, 64% of patients with mGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73m2 were incorrectly classified as a less severe CKD stage by CKD-EPI 2021. In Blacks, CKD-EPI 2021 underestimated eGFR by 17.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, which was higher than the alternate equations except for Royal Free Hospital (p < 0.001). The novel race-neutral eGFR equation, CKD-EPI 2021, improves the GFR estimation overall but may not accurately capture true kidney function in cirrhosis, specifically at low GFR. There is an urgent need for a race-neutral equation in liver disease reflecting the complexity of kidney function physiology unique to cirrhosis, given implications for organ allocation and dual organ transplant.

Pharmacokinetics (PK) data of iruplinalkib have been collected in healthy subjects and patient populations in several studies. We developed a population PK (PopPK) model for describing iruplinalkib plasma concentrations and for evaluating whether dose adjustments are necessary based on demographic factors or disease characteristics. Plasma concentration–time data were collected from 392 participants (16 healthy volunteers and 372 patients with solid tumors) who received single or multiple doses of iruplinalkib in four trials. Data were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Iruplinalkib plasma concentrations were best described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. Baseline body weight, time-varying albumin, time-varying creatinine clearance, and time-varying lactate dehydrogenase were significant covariates of apparent clearance from the central compartment (CL/F) while baseline body weight was a significant covariate of apparent volume of the central compartment (V1/F). Given the small or modest effect of all statistically significant covariates on iruplinalkib exposure at steady-state, no covariate was expected to have clinically meaningful effects on iruplinalkib exposure. Furthermore, iruplinalkib absorption was delayed 0.472 h after meal, and Ka was 58.8% of that under fasting. However, there was no difference in exposure of iruplinalkib between the fasted and fed states. In conclusion, the PopPK model adequately describes iruplinalkib PK properties in Chinese healthy subjects and patients with solid tumors. No covariate had a clinically meaningful impact on iruplinalkib exposure. These results indicate that dose adjustment of iruplinalkib is not necessary, based on the aforementioned covariates, for ALK-positive NSCLC patients. © 2024 Qilu Pharmaceutical Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.

Materials and Methods: Medical records were searched for dogs with histologically and immunohistochemically characterised nodular splenic lesions with mixed stromal, histiocytic and lymphoid cells and the presence of systemic inflammatory markers at the time of diagnosis. Results: Four dogs were included, of which three had an undifferentiated splenic stromal sarcoma and one had a splenic leiomyosarcoma. Fever and abdominal pain were reported in three and four cases, respectively. All dogs showed hyperglobulinaemia and marked changes in the serum protein electrophoresis profile. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen concentrations were both increased in three cases. These abnormalities completely resolved after splenectomy. Moreover, two dogs had concomitant glomerular disease and one dog had liver amyloidosis. Three dogs were still alive and asymptomatic 1, 6 and 9 months after surgery. One dog died 16 months after the initial presentation due to complications related to progressive renal failure. Clinical Significance: Based on this report, nodular splenic lesions with heterogeneous cell components may directly be associated with a pro-inflammatory state and should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of fever and hyperglobulinaemia in dogs. Furthermore, early recognition and treatment of these lesions could reduce the risk of systemic complications potentially associated with amyloid deposit and organ failure. © 2025 The Author(s).

In contrast, the use of wearable devices that monitor physical activity (PA) has been associated with behavioural changes in some studies. It is uncertain whether risk communication might enhance the effects of wearable devices. We aim to assess the effects of communicating genetic risk for T2D alone or in combination with wearable device functions on wearable device-measured PA among overweight or obese East Asians. Methods and analysis In a parallel group, randomised controlled trial, 355 overweight or obese East Asian individuals aged 40–60 years are allocated into one of three groups: one control and two intervention groups. Blood samples will be used for estimation of T2D genetic risk and analysis of metabolic risk markers. Genetic risk of T2D will be estimated based on 113 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with T2D among East Asians. All three groups receive a Fitbit device. Both intervention groups will receive T2D genetic risk estimates along with lifestyle advice, but one of the intervention groups additionally uses Fitbit’s step goal setting and prompt functions. Questionnaires and physical measurements are administered at baseline, immediately after intervention delivery, and 6 and 12 months post intervention. The primary outcome is time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA from the Fitbit, which will be assessed at baseline, immediately post intervention, 12 months post intervention and at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include other wearable device-measured parameters, sedentary time, and sleep, blood pressure, metabolic risk markers, hand grip strength, self-reported PA, fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking, and psychological variables. Between-group differences in the continuous and categorical variables collected at baseline will be examined using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and χ2 tests, respectively.

Nevertheless, variations exist in the observed association between night shift work and prostate cancer (PCa). This study aims to systematically explore the association between night shift work and the risk of PCa. Design Cohort study and Mendelian randomisation (MR) study were used. Setting Cohort study data was from the UK Biobank (UKB). MR study using data was from the Finngen study and UKB through the Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) Open Genome-Wide Association Study Project. Participants Participants without prior PCa in paid employment or self-employment were include in the current work schedule cohort, participants without PCa who provided employment history formed the lifetime night shift work cohort. Main outcome measures The outcome, incident PCa, was obtained from cancer register through linkage to national cancer databases. National cancer registries centralised information received from separate regional cancer centres around the UK. Results A total of 130 853 participants were included in the current work schedule cohort, while the lifetime night shift work cohort comprised 49 511 participants. Over a median follow-up duration of 13.9 years, the current work schedule cohort witnessed 4993 incident cases of PCa, while the lifetime night shift work cohort recorded 2022 PCa cases. In the analysis of the current work schedule, final model showed that no significant association was found between shift work and PCa risk, whether it involved shift but no night shifts (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.08), some night shifts (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.33) and usual night shifts (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.19). In the analysis of the average frequency of night shift work, final model showed no significant impact of different night shift frequencies (<3/month: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.29; 3-8/month: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19; >8/month: HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.07) on the risk of PCa. No significant association was found for either <10 years (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.09) or ≥10 years (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16) of night shift work. Subsequent subgroup and sensitivity analyses demonstrated consistent results without significant alterations. Furthermore, in the two-sample MR analysis, no statistically significant causal relationship was identified between night shift work and the incidence of PCa.

The growing burden of CAD in Asia and the emergence of novel CT-based risk markers highlight the need for an automated platform that integrates patient data with CCTA findings to provide tailored, accurate cardiovascular risk assessments. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform for CAD assessment using CCTA in Singapore’s multiethnic population. We will conduct a hybrid retrospective-prospective recruitment of patients who have undergone CCTA as part of the diagnostic workup for CAD, along with prospective follow-up for clinical endpoints. CCTA images will be analysed locally and by a core lab for coronary stenosis grading, Agatston scoring, epicardial adipose tissue evaluation and plaque analysis. The images and analyses will also be uploaded to an AI platform for deidentification, integration and automated reporting, generating precision AI toolkits for each parameter. Participants CCTA images and baseline characteristics have been collected and verified for 4196 recruited patients, comprising 75% Chinese, 6% Malay, 10% Indian and 9% from other ethnic groups.

Early identification and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes. Identifying children at risk is challenging due to clinical heterogeneity and overlap with other conditions. Current evaluations of sepsis criteria adopt a variable-centred approach, evaluating each criterion independently. The objective of this study was to explore associations between patterns of sepsis screening criteria and sepsis risk in children screened in the emergency department (ED) to identify distinct profiles that describe the clinical heterogeneity of suspected sepsis. Methods This secondary analysis involved 3473 children screened for sepsis across 12 EDs in Queensland, Australia. Bayesian profile regression was used to construct data-driven clinical profiles derived from sepsis screening criteria and their association with suspected sepsis, defined as senior medical officer diagnosis and antibiotic administration in the ED. Posterior risk probabilities (Prs) with 95% credible intervals (CIs) were calculated for each profile. Profiles were internally validated by assessing their association with sepsis, septic shock, organ dysfunction and infection sources, in both adjusted and unadjusted models. Results Seven distinct clinical profiles were identified. Two profiles were labelled as high risk of suspected sepsis (profile 1, n=22: Pr 0.73, 95% CI 0.55, 0.89; profile 2, n=150: Pr 0.69, 95% CI 0.59, 0.80), four as moderate risk and one as low risk. High-risk profiles were characterised by severe illness indicators and elevated lactate levels. Moderate-risk profiles included criteria such as altered behaviour, young age (<3 months) and respiratory distress. High-risk profiles had strong associations with all clinical outcomes. Conclusions Seven clinical profiles were identified that varied in their risk of suspected sepsis and associated outcomes. Validation of these profiles in diverse populations and identification of which profiles are likely to benefit from certain interventions is needed. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007744949,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

While PNI has been shown to be a significant prognostic tool in gastrointestinal surgery and heart failure, its role in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate whether PNI can serve as a meaningful risk factor for patients undergoing CABG. Methods This observational retrospective analysis involved a substantial sample of 2889 patients who underwent isolated CABG at one of four medical centres. The primary outcomes included short- and long-term mortality. Perioperative serum albumin levels and total lymphocyte counts used to calculate PNIs were collected 48 hours before the operation, 24 hours after the operation and at discharge. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors of short-term mortality. Survival and relative risks were assessed using Cox regression analysis and the Kaplan-Meier test. Results Among the 2889 patients, 64 (2.2%) died within 30 days following CABG. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that higher preoperative PNI was independently associated with reduced short-term mortality (OR=0.852 per unit increase, 95% CI 0.802 to 0.904, p<0.001). Regarding long-term outcomes, among the 2825 patients who were discharged alive, 199 deaths occurred over a median follow-up period of 54.9 months. Patients with a normal PNI at discharge (>40) exhibited significantly higher long-term survival rates compared with those with a lower PNI (≤40) (log-rank p=0.003). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that a normal PNI at discharge(>40) independently predicted a lower risk of long-term all-cause mortality (HR=0.718, 95% CI 0.529 to 0.974, p=0.033). Conclusions PNI at various time points may play a crucial predictive role in mortality among CABG-treated patients, and a low PNI serves as a risk factor for both short- and long-term survival. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218108429,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to assess primary care adherence to guideline-recommended standards for patients with overlapping HF, CKD and T2D in England. Methods Using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1998-2020), we evaluated care adherence across 161 529 individuals with HF, CKD or T2D before and after developing a second of these conditions. We analysed disease investigation rates, medication use and predictors of guideline adherence. Results We identified 161 529 patients with CKD followed by HF (CKD+HF, 40%), CKD+T2D (51.3%) and HF+T2D (8.6%) with a median of 3.1 years follow-up after the second diagnosis. In CKD+HF, CKD+T2D and HF+T2D groups, prescription rates of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (71%, 64.1% and 74.4%), beta-blockers (53.1%,36.2% and 55.1%), antiplatelets (56.2%, 45.2% and 54.4%) and statins (56.7%, 68.5% and 72%) were suboptimal. Advanced age, female sex, peripheral arterial disease and cancer were associated with a lower likelihood of checking blood pressure, creatinine and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) after HF, CKD and T2D diagnoses, respectively. The first diagnosis of HF was associated with reduced odds of having HbA1C measured after T2D diagnosis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.86), compared with CKD as the first diagnosis. Conclusions In overlapping HF, CKD and T2D, guideline-recommended care is suboptimal, with inequalities by age, sex, disease on first presentation and comorbidities. Quality improvement requires linked data collection, monitoring and action across diseases. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000519095,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Here, we report a case of diabetes and obesity in a 56-year-old woman. She was diagnosed with severe obesity, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and a positive antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) test result at the age of 39 years. She developed diabetes 7 years later, meeting the diagnostic criteria for SPIDDM (probable). Despite high GADA levels, her endogenous insulin secretion has been preserved for over a decade. GADA has been regarded as a marker of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, and high levels of GADA are considered a risk factor for future insulin deficiency. However, the role of GADA in its pathogenesis remains unclear. GADA is not a specific indicator of autoimmune diabetes, as it is also positive for autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) and stiff-person syndrome. Therefore, a positive GADA test alone is not sufficient to predict insulin deficiency in an individual case, even if the titer is high. In the early stages, autoimmune diabetes presents clinical features similar to those of type 2 diabetes, particularly obesity. Although insulin therapy is often started early in the treatment of autoimmune diabetes, as the consensus statement indicates, when endogenous insulin secretion is preserved and the risk of insulin deficiency is low, efforts should be made to prevent body weight gain and the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) by following treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes, with the exception of the use of sulfonylurea agents.

Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted, and patients with a proven hemoglobinopathy diagnosis were included. Fasting blood was obtained to measure creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, uric acid, and ferritin. In addition, a 24-h urine specimen was collected to determine the level of urine albumin, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, uric acid, and β2-microglobulin. Fractional excretion of sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and uric acid was also calculated. Spearman’s coefficient of correlation was used to determine the correlations between serum ferritin level and other variables. Results: Of the sixty-six patients studied, 3.0% had sickle cell thalassemia, 80.3% had major thalassemia, and 72.7% had intermediate thalassemia. In our study, serum ferritin, 24-h urine protein, and fractional excretion of sodium, calcium, and urine were higher than the normal range in thalassemia patients. There was a significant correlation between serum ferritin level and fractional excretion of magnesium, calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and uric acid with a negative correlation coefficient (p ≤ 0.05). We also found that the serum ferritin levels strongly correlated with microalbuminuria (p ≤ 0.05). Copyright © 2025 Mohammad Tammadondar et al.

Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 150 T2DKD patients in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 2018 to December 2021. All patients received short-term CSII treatment and achieved the blood glucose target by adjusting insulin infusion. The patients’ daily insulin requirements during the treatment were recorded and analyzed. Result: There were 91 males and 59 females with an average age of 60.6 ± 10.6 years. Total daily insulin dose (TDD), total daily insulin dose per kilogram (TDD kg−1), total basal insulin dose per kilogram (TBa kg−1), and total bolus insulin dose per kilogram (TBo kg−1) fell with the decline of eGFR when achieving the blood glucose target except for the ratio of total basal insulin dose (TBD) to TDD (%TBa). Insulin requirement was less in patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.05). When achieving the blood glucose target, eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 group and eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 group were 0.71 ± 0.19 U/kg and 0.60 ± 0.24 U/kg, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that glycated hemoglobin and eGFR were independent factors associated with TDD kg−1. Conclusion: In patients with T2DKD who received short-term CSII therapy, the insulin requirement decline with the decrease of eGFR, while the %TBa did not change significantly. The dosage of insulin should be adjusted according to the level of eGFR in patients with T2DKD treated with CSII. Copyright © 2025 Qianqiu Feng et al.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complication in malaria-infected individuals with a high mortality rate (80% to 100%) and can occur before, during, or after antimalarial drug treatment. Although inflammation and epithelial/endothelial injury pathways have been determined through these studies, specific circulating malaria-associated ARDS markers have not yet been established. We applied a quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approach to identify altered molecular pathways in a mouse model of malaria-associated ARDS. Acute-phase response (APR) proteins were regulated in the ARDS group, suggesting their potential involvement in the development of the syndrome. They may serve as biomarkers when analyzed alongside other proteins that require further investigation. Additionally, the regulation of APR proteins in the ARDS group provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of ARDS, contributing to a better understanding of the syndrome.

Insulin icodec is a novel basal insulin designed for once-weekly administration. Methods: This study investigated the pharmacokinetic properties of icodec in children and adolescents with T2D aged 10 to < 18 years. Eighteen insulin-treated (daily basal insulin dose ≥ 0.2 U/kg) participants (11 females/7 males; mean ± standard deviation body mass index 38.5 ± 7.1 kg/m2, HbA1c 7.5 ± 1.3%) received a single subcutaneous injection of icodec (5.6 U/kg). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were drawn frequently until 35 days postinjection. Observed single-dose pharmacokinetic profiles were extrapolated to steady state using pharmacokinetic modeling. Results: One-week icodec pharmacokinetic profiles observed after a single dose and extrapolated to steady state suggest that icodec exposure covers the full weekly dosing interval in children and adolescents with T2D. After a single dose, geometric mean total exposure was 819∙105 pmol∙h/L [coefficient of variation (CV) 28.2%] and maximum concentration (Cmax) was 4.22∙105 pmol/L (CV 25.8%). Median time to maximum concentration (tmax) was 21 h (range 12–27 h). When extrapolated to steady state, geometric mean total exposure was 771∙105 pmol∙h/L (CV 29.9%) and maximum concentration was 6.35∙105 pmol/L (CV 27.3%). Median tmax was 15 h (range 13–19 h). In total, six adverse events (AEs) were reported in two participants. All AEs were mild and recovered/resolved. No serious or severe AEs, hypersensitivity or injection site reactions, or hyperglycemic episodes (plasma glucose > 14.0 mmol/L and blood ketones > 1.5 mmol/L) were reported. One level 1 hypoglycemic episode (plasma glucose < 3.9 and ≥ 3.0 mmol/L) was reported. Conclusion: Icodec was safe and well-tolerated in the current study in children and adolescents with T2D. The pharmacokinetic properties of icodec support its potential for once-weekly administration in children and adolescents with T2D. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05790681.

We conducted a phase I study of TTI-101, a first-in-class, selective small-molecule inhibitor of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, in patients with advanced metastatic cancer. Patients and Methods: Patients were treated with TTI-101 orally twice daily in 28-day cycles at four dose levels (DL): 3.2 (DL1), 6.4 (DL2), 12.8 (DL3), and 25.6 (DL4) mg/kg/day (“3+3” design). Three TTI-101 formulations were used in a stepwise manner (NCT03195699). Results: Sixty-four patients were treated (median age, 63 years; male sex, 52%; median number of prior therapies, 3). No dose-limiting toxicities or fatal treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were observed. Diarrhea (mostly grade 1/2) was the only TRAE observed in ≥30% of subjects. Five patients experienced grade 3 TRAEs that resolved. TTI-101 showed linear pharmacokinetics from DL1 to DL3, with the pharmacokinetics plateauing at DL3. The recommended phase II dose is 12.8 mg/kg/day (DL3). Of the 41 patients who were evaluable for response, five (12%) had confirmed partial responses (cPR) and 17 (41%) had stable disease. Three (18%) of the 17 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had a cPR (median time to treatment failure, 10.6 months). Two other cPRs were noted in one patient with ovarian cancer and one patient with gastric cancer. Conclusions: TTI-101 was well tolerated. cPRs were observed across tumor types. The antitumor activity of TTI-101 monotherapy in patients with advanced, metastatic solid tumors is promising.

Adipocytes are the main nonmalignant cells of the breast tumor microenvironment (TME). However, adipocyte metabolism is usually ignored in oncology, and the mechanisms that couple T2D to TNBC outcomes are poorly understood. In this study, we hypothesized that exosomes, small vesicles secreted by TME breast adipocytes, drive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in TNBC via miRNAs. Exosomes were purified from conditioned media of 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, either insulin-sensitive (IS) or insulin-resistant (IR). Murine 4T1 cells, a TNBC model, were treated with exosomes in vitro (72 hours). EMT, proliferation, and angiogenesis were elevated in IR versus control and IS. Brain metastases showed more mesenchymal morphology and EMT enrichment in the IR group. MiR-145a-3p is highly differentially expressed between IS and IR and potentially regulates metastasis. ©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007334553,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We studied genome landscapes, phylogenies, and clonal compositions of 91 PDACs in relation to clinicopathologic features. There was no difference in the number of driver mutations or evolutionary timing when each mutation occurred. High truncal density, a metric of the accumulation of somatic mutations in the lineage that gave rise to each PDAC, was significantly associated with worse overall survival. Polyclonal, monoclonal, or mixed polyclonal/monoclonal metastases were identified across the cohort, highlighting multiple forms of intertumoral heterogeneity. Advanced stage and treated PDACs had higher odds of being polyclonal, whereas oligometastatic PDACs had fewer driver alterations, a lower fractional allelic loss, and increased likelihood of being monoclonal. In sum, our findings reveal novel insights into the dynamic nature of the PDAC genome beyond established genetic paradigms. Significance: Although the pancreatic cancer genome has been described, it has not been explored with respect to stages of diagnosis or treatment bottlenecks. We now describe and quantify the genomic features of PDAC in the context of evolutionary metrics and in doing so have identified a novel prognostic biomarker. © 2024 The Authors.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218352677,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

To dissect the pathophysiology of TED, we used single-nucleus RNA-Seq to analyze orbital fat specimens from both patients with TED and matched individuals acting as controls. The analysis demonstrated a marked increase in the proportion of fibroblasts transitioning to adipogenesis in the orbital fat of patients with TED compared with that in control patients. This was associated with diverse alterations in immune cell composition. Significant alterations in the IGF-1R signaling pathway were noted between TED specimens and those from control patients, indicating a potential pathological mechanism driven by IGF-1R signaling abnormalities. Additionally, our data showed that linsitinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of IGF-1R, effectively reduced adipogenesis in TED orbital fibroblasts in vitro, suggesting its potential utility as a therapeutic agent. Our findings reveal that, beyond immune dysfunction, abnormal IGF-1R signaling leading to enhanced adipogenesis is a crucial pathogenic mechanism in TED. © 2024, Kim et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212875440,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Aberrant nutrient sensing by O-GlcNAcylation and mTORC1 is linked to T2D and the failure of insulin-producing β cells. However, the nature of their crosstalk in β cells remains unexplored. Recently, O-GlcNAcylation, a posttranslation modification controlled by enzymes O-GlcNAc transferase/O-GlcNAcase (OGT/OGA), emerged as a pivotal regulator for β cell health; deficiency in either enzyme causes β cell failure. The present study investigates the previously unidentified connection between nutrient sensor OGT and mTORC1 crosstalk to regulate β cell mass and function in vivo. We show reduced OGT and mTORC1 activity in islets of a preclinical β cell dysfunction model and islets from humans with obesity. Using loss or gain of function of OGT, we identified that O-GlcNAcylation positively regulated mTORC1 signaling in β cells. O-GlcNAcylation negatively modulated autophagy, as the removal of OGT increased autophagy, while the deletion of OGA decreased it. Increasing mTORC1 signaling, via deletion of TSC2, alleviated the diabetic phenotypes by increasing β cell mass but not β cell function in OGT-deficient mice. Downstream phospho-protein signaling analyses revealed diverging effects on MKK4 and calmodulin signaling between islets with OGT, TSC2, or combined deletion. These data provide evidence of OGT’s significance as an upstream regulator of mTORC1 and autophagy, crucial for the regulation of β cell function and glucose homeostasis. © 2024, Jo et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211504035,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We previously reported hepatic ERK activation during obesity development to stimulate a neuronal relay system, consisting of afferent splanchnic nerves from the liver and efferent vagal nerves to the pancreas, thereby triggering adaptive β cell proliferation. However, the mechanism linking obesity with the interorgan system originating in hepatic ERK activation remains unclear. Herein, we clarified that colonic inflammation promotes β cell proliferation through this interorgan system from the liver to the pancreas. First, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment induced colonic inflammation and hepatic ERK activation as well as β cell proliferation, all of which were suppressed by blockades of the neuronal relay system by several approaches. In addition, treatment with anti–lymphocyte Peyer’s patch adhesion molecule-1 (anti-LPAM1) antibody suppressed β cell proliferation induced by DSS treatment. Importantly, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding also elicited colonic inflammation, and its inhibition by anti-LPAM1 antibody administration suppressed hepatic ERK activation and β cell proliferation induced by HFD. Thus, colonic inflammation triggers adaptive β cell proliferation via the interorgan mechanism originating in hepatic ERK activation. The present study revealed a potentially novel role of the gastrointestinal tract in the maintenance of β cell regulation. © 2025, Kubo et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004781687,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Furthermore, we uncovered 2 residues (β11, β26, participating in pockets 6 and 4, respectively) on the DRB3 molecule responsible for the progression among DR3 carriers; motif RY and LF respectively delay and promote the progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73 and 2.38, P = 0.039 and 0.017, respectively).

Maladaptive hypertrophy, podocyte stress, and depletion contribute to kidney function decline. Although insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) plays a key role in early hypertrophic responses in the single kidney state, its impact on kidney transplant (KTx) outcomes remains uncertain. This report tests the hypothesis that early IGF-1 exposure reduces KTx survival. METHODS. Population datasets compared incident death-censored graft failure (DCGF) rates by age at KTx (n = 366,404) with IGF-1 levels by age (n = 15,014). A clinical study of 216 KTx recipients evaluated the association of IGF-1 exposure with DCGF and secondary outcomes of proteinuria and biopsy-proven acute rejection. IGF-1 exposure was modeled using pre-KTx IGF-1 levels and donor kidney dose estimated from the donor/recipient body surface area ratio reflecting allograft hyperfiltration. The association of DCGF with an IGF1 SNP linked to high IGF-1 levels was assessed in 724 genotyped allograft recipients. Single-cell transcriptomic data from first-year post-KTx patients and binephric donors were compared to assess intrarenal cellular expression of IGF1, IGF1R, and growth hormone receptor (GHR) transcripts. RESULTS. DCGF risk by age at KTx paralleled IGF-1 levels by age. Higher IGF-1 exposure was associated with significantly increased risks of DCGF, proteinuria, and T cell–mediated rejection. Genotypic analysis showed a 50% increase in DCGF risk per risk allele at IGF1 expression quantitative trait locus rs35767. First-year biopsy results revealed no increase in intrarenal IGF1 transcripts, while GHR and IGF1R transcripts were suppressed, consistent with circulating IGF-1 (vs. graft-derived IGF-1) being the primary source of IGF-1 exposure. CONCLUSION. We identify a role for the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis in reducing KTx survival. © 2025, Cusick et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007944190,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Although IVF is viewed as largely safe, it is associated with adverse outcomes in the fetus, placenta, and adult offspring. Because studies focusing on the effect of IVF on the male reproductive system are limited, we used a mouse model to assess the morphological and molecular effects of IVF on male offspring. We evaluated 3 developmental stages: 18.5-day fetuses and 12- and 39-week-old adults. Regardless of age, we observed changes in testicular-to-body weight ratios, serum testosterone levels, testicular morphology, gene expression, and DNA methylation. Also, sperm showed changes in morphology and DNA methylation. To assess multigenerational phenotypes, we mated IVF-conceived and naturally conceived males with wild-type females. Offspring from IVF males exhibited decreased fetal-to-placental weight ratios and changes in placenta gene expression and morphology regardless of sex. At 12 weeks of age, offspring showed higher body weights and differences in glucose, triglyceride, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL/VLDL-C levels. Both sexes showed changes in gene expression in liver, testes, and ovaries and decreased global DNA methylation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that male IVF offspring exhibit abnormal testicular and sperm morphology and molecular alterations with a multigenerational impact. © 2025, Rhon-Calderon et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003748227,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study examined the underlying cellular mechanisms associated with insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic disease risk within subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in youth with obesity and IR compared with those without IR. METHODS. Thirteen adolescents who were insulin sensitive (IS) and 17 adolescents with IR and obesity underwent a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test and MRI to measure abdominal fat distribution and liver fat content. Lipolysis was determined by glycerol turnover ([2H5]-glycerol infusion) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) phosphorylation (Western blot) from SAT samples biopsied prior to and 30-minutes following insulin infusion during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC). RESULTS. Glycerol turnover suppression during the HEC (first step) was lower in participants with IR compared with those with IS. Prior to insulin infusion, activated ATGL (reflected by the p-ATGL (Ser406)-to-ATGL ratio) was greater in participants with IR compared with those with IS and suppressed in response to a 30-minute insulin exposure in participants with IS, but not in those with IR. Lastly, greater ATGL inactivation is associated with greater glycerol suppression and lower liver fat. CONCLUSIONS. Insulin-mediated inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis via ATGL is dysregulated among adolescents with IR compared with those with IS, thereby serving as a vital mechanism linking glucose and insulin dysregulation and ectopic lipid storage within the liver. © 2025, Slusher et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000732966,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

While most hypertriglyceridemia is asymptomatic, hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis (HTGAP) can be more severe than AP of other etiologies. The reasons underlying this are unclear. We thus examined whether lipolytic generation of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) from circulating triglycerides (TGs) could worsen clinical outcomes. METHODS. Admission serum TGs, NEFA composition, and concentrations were analyzed prospectively for 269 patients with AP. These parameters, demographics, and clinical outcomes were compared between HTG-AP (TGs >500 mg/dL; American Heart Association [AHA] 2018 guidelines) and AP of other etiologies. Serum NEFAs were correlated with serum TG fatty acids (TGFAs) alone and with the product of TGFA serum lipase (NEFAs - TGFAs × lipase). Studies in mice and rats were conducted to understand the role of HTG lipolysis in organ failure and to interpret the NEFA-TGFA correlations. RESULTS. Patients with HTG-AP had higher serum NEFA and TG levels and more severe AP (19% vs. 7%; P < 0.03) than did individuals with AP of other etiologies. Correlations of long-chain unsaturated NEFAs with corresponding TGFAs increased with TG concentrations up to 500 mg/dL and declined thereafter. However, NEFA - TGFA × lipase correlations became stronger with TGs above 500 mg/dL. AP and intravenous lipase infusion in rodents caused lipolysis of circulating TGs to NEFAs. This led to multisystem organ failure, which was prevented by pancreatic TG lipase deletion or lipase inhibition. CONCLUSIONS. HTG-AP is made severe by the NEFAs generated from intravascular lipolysis of circulating TGs. Strategies that prevent TG lipolysis may be effective in improving clinical outcomes for patients with HTG-AP.

Methods: A qualitative study with individual semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 adults (8 women, ages 45-74 years) with type 2 diabetes. Purposive sampling was used, and participants from 3 different intervention groups in the micro-choice-based concentrated group intervention were recruited. Thematic analysis was used for the data analysis. Results: Three main themes were identified: (1) group intervention tailored to individual needs through friendly and skilled professionals, (2) valuable social interactions and an experience of fellowship, and (3) commitment to change through goal setting and conscious micro-choices. The participants described a readiness for change that was met by important knowledge from skilled professionals in the concentrated intervention. They reported that new knowledge, particularly about micro-choices and the focus on how insulin works in the body, led to change in their awareness and self-management. The concentrated group intervention was a preferred setting that contained a sense of community without compromising on meeting individual needs. Participants described internalized changes after the intervention and a willingness to adhere to changes necessary for their self-management. Conclusion: Study findings showed that a micro-choice-based concentrated group intervention for people with type 2 diabetes can be a valuable approach contributing to improved patient activation and diabetes self-management. The findings underpin the importance of increased diabetes knowledge and support from an interprofessional team to bring about significant changes in everyday life. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216967256,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This finding is intriguing because CHO cells do not generate α2-6 sialylation, which constitutes the majority of human pdVWF sialylation. We hypothesized that glycan differences might regulate the longer half-life of CHO-rVWF. In lectin plate-binding assays and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis, we confirmed that CHO-rVWF lacked α2-6–linked sialylation. Conversely, however, α2-3–linked sialylation was significantly increased on CHO-rVWF, which also had reduced exposed β-galactose (β-Gal) compared to pdVWF. Consistent with human data, CHO-rVWF clearance was significantly (P < .001) reduced in VWF–/– mice compared to pdVWF. However, clearance of asialo-pdVWF and asialo–CHO-rVWF were identical. In keeping with the in vivo half-life prolongation, CHO-rVWF binding to murine macrophages (P = .012) and HepG2 cells (P = .001) was significantly decreased compared to pdVWF. Furthermore, CHO-rVWF binding to purified macrophage-galactose-type lectin (MGL) receptor and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) was also significantly reduced. In contrast to pdVWF, in vivo studies in MGL1–/– mice and Asgr1–/– mice demonstrated that neither MGL nor ASGPR plays significant roles in regulating CHO-rVWF clearance. Together, our findings demonstrate that enhanced α2-3–linked sialylation on CHO-rVWF is responsible for its extended half-life. © 2025 American Society of Hematology",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002662423,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Several prognostic markers have been associated with CAR T-cell outcomes, such as tumor burden, response to bridging chemotherapy, and laboratory parameters at the time of lymphodepletion or infusion. The effect of cancer cachexia and weight loss before CAR T cells on toxicity and outcomes is not well understood. Here, we present a retrospective single-institution cohort study of 259 patients with lymphoma treated with CAR T cells between 2017 and 2023. We observed that patients with >5% decrease in their body mass index in the 3 months preceding CAR T-cell treatment (weight loss group; all meeting one of the commonly accepted definitions of cancer cachexia) had higher disease burden and inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α) at the time of lymphodepletion and CAR T-cell infusion. Patients with weight loss experienced higher rates of grade 3+ neurotoxicity and early hematotoxicity, but those effects were not seen upon multivariable adjustment. However, in both univariate and multivariable analysis, patients with weight loss had worse response rates, overall survival, and event-free survival, indicating that weight loss is an independent poor prognostic factor. Our data suggest that weight loss in the 3 months preceding CAR T-cell therapy represents a worrisome “alarm signal” and a potentially modifiable factor, alongside tumor burden and inflammation, and warrants further investigation in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. © 2024 by The American Society of Hematology.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215275184,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to investigate the association of these novel antihyperglycaemic drugs versus metformin with fewer COPD exacerbations in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) comorbid with COPD. Methods Using the national administrative database covering 99% of the medical facilities in Japan, we constructed three active comparators new-user cohorts comprising 36 317 patients with T2DM and COPD who initiated treatment with the novel antihyperglycaemic drugs and metformin between 2014 and 2022. Patients’ backgrounds were balanced using overlap propensity score weighting. We calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the initial occurrence of COPD exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model. Results DPP-4 Is were associated with a higher incidence of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (22.4 versus 20.4 per 100 person-years; HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07–1.25) compared with metformin. In contrast, the incidence of such exacerbations in the GLP-1 RAs (30.1 versus 24.4 per 100 person-years; HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87–1.32) and SGLT-2 Is (20.7 versus 21.8 per 100 person-years; HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94–1.06) groups were comparable with that in the metformin group. Conclusions While DPP-4 Is were associated with poorer control of COPD compared with metformin, GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 Is offered COPD control comparable with that of metformin. © The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007362097,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The CD131 receptor is indispensable for signalling by the β common (βc) family of cytokines encompassing granulocyte−macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-3, which instigate both type-2 and non-type-2 inflammatory responses. This study aims to determine whether antagonising CD131 signalling can prevent pulmonary inflammation, alveolar cell death and emphysema development. Methods We performed in-house and in silico transcriptomic analysis to investigate the gene expression of CD131 (CSF2RB) and pathway enrichment for βc cytokine signalling in blood, sputum and lung biopsies of COPD patients. To model emphysema, transgenic mice expressing human CD131 were exposed to elastase or cigarette smoke (CS) and a fully human monoclonal antibody (CSL311) was employed to inhibit CD131 signalling. Results CD131 gene expression was significantly increased in COPD, along with an enrichment of gene set for βc cytokine signalling. In transgenic mice subjected to emphysema models, CD131 antagonism effectively prevented lung injury, alveolar cell death and emphysema development. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing identified pathway enrichment for myeloid cell activation, type-2 immune response and macrophage alternative activation in elastase-induced emphysematous mice, mirroring human COPD. Blocking CD131 signalling almost completely reversed the global gene expression alterations associated with emphysema development. Conclusions CD131 signalling orchestrates pulmonary inflammation in COPD, resulting in immunopathology that underpins emphysema and lung function decline. Antagonising CD131 therefore represents a unique strategy to simultaneously target multiple pathogenic myeloid cell populations. © The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009237968,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Measuring N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels is diagnostically useful, but the optimal cut-off point must be determined. This study aimed to optimise NT-proBNP cut-offs for diagnosing HF-related PEs and develop a scoring model to improve diagnostic precision. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 2005 patients with PEs, who were divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified the optimal cut-off point for NT-proBNP in pleural fluid and serum. A scoring system was developed based on logistic regression (TRIPOD statement) that included both clinical and laboratory variables. Its diagnostic accuracy was compared with that of existing methods using the area under the curve (AUC). Results NT-proBNP ⩾2500 pg·mL−1 was found to be the optimal cut-off for identifying HF-related effusions. Pleural fluid NT-proBNP levels tended to have superior diagnostic accuracy compared with serum NT-proBNP levels. A scoring system, denominated as BANCA (bilateral effusions on chest radiographs, age, NT-proBNP levels in pleural fluid, cholesterol in pleural fluid, and albumin gradient), demonstrated an AUC of 0.957, outperforming existing diagnostic criteria for identifying cardiac effusions. In cases misclassified as exudates by Light’s criteria, the BANCA score accurately identified 80% of the HF-related PEs. Conclusions The BANCA score is a reliable tool for diagnosing HF-related PEs, offering superior accuracy compared with conventional methods. It is particularly useful for identifying cardiac effusions that are misclassified using traditional criteria. ©The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011862779,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Although the clinical symptoms of T1DM differ from those of MS, such as pancreatic β-cell failure in T1DM and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) in MS, both pathologies are considered as autoimmune-related diseases with shared pathogenic pathways, which include autophagy, inflammation and degeneration, among others. Considering the challenges in obtaining pancreatic β-cells and CNS tissue from patients with T1DM and MS, respectively, it is fundamental to explore alternative methods for evaluating disease status. Proteomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is an ideal approach for identifying novel and potential biomarkers for both autoimmune diseases. Methods: We conducted a proteomic analysis of PBMCs from patients with T1DM and relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis (herein forth MS) patients (n = 9 per condition), using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach. The patients were diagnosed following the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for T1DM and McDonald criteria for MS respectively, and were aged over 18 years and more than 2 years from the onset respectively. Results: A total of 2476 proteins were differentially expressed in PBMCs from patients with T1DM and MS patients compared with those form healthy controls (H). Predictive analysis highlighted 15 common proteins, up- or downregulated in PBMCs from patients with T1DM and MS patients vs. healthy controls, involved in the immune system activity (BTF3, TTR, CD59, CSTB), diseases of the neuronal system (TTR), signal transduction (STMN1, LAMTOR5), metabolism of nucleotides (RPS21), proteins (TTR, ENAM, CD59, RPS21, SRP9) and RNA (SRSF10, RPS21). In addition, this study revealed both shared and distinct molecular patterns between the two conditions. Conclusions: Compared with H, patients with T1DM and MS presented a specific expression pattern of common proteins has been identified. This pattern underscores the shared mechanisms involved in their immune responses and neurological complications, alongside dysregulation of the autophagy pathway. Notably, CSTB has emerged as a differential biomarker, distinguishing between these two autoimmune diseases. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217661590,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Using pleural fluid characteristics, pleural infection can be classified into microbiological-positive pleural infection (MPPI) and microbiological-negative pleural infection (MNPI). This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of microbiological positivity in pleural infection, and to evaluate the performance of RAPID (renal, age, purulence, infection source, dietary factor) score in these subgroups. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized for pleural infection over a 10-year period in two acute-care hospitals in Hong Kong were evaluated. According to the pleural fluid characteristics, they were classified into MPPI and MNPI, respectively. Survival was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Performance of RAPID score to predict mortality at 3-month and 1-year was evaluated using C-statistics. Results: In total, 381 patients with pleural infection were included. They were classified into MPPI (n = 169) and MNPI (n = 212), respectively. The MPPI group had more elderly home residence and use of large-bore chest tube, and higher Charlson comorbidity index and RAPID score, compared to the MNPI group. Length-of-stay, the need of surgery and intensive care were similar between the two groups. MPPI was associated with significantly increased risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.46, 95% CI 1.08–1.98). Three-month mortality was significantly higher in MPPI compared to MNPI (24.9% vs. 10.4%, p < 0.001; adjusted odd ratio 2.05, 95% CI 1.11–3.80). The trend continued at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years. RAPID score predicted 3-month and 1-year mortality in both groups (C-statistics, MPPI 0.71, 0.75; MNPI 0.84, 0.81). In the MPPI group, presence of Staphylococcus aureus (aHR 2.26, 95% CI 1.43–3.57) and Gram-negative organisms other than Enterobacteriaceae (aHR 2.00, 95% CI 1.10–3.61) were associated with worse survival, while presence of Streptococcus anginosus group was associated better survival (aHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32–0.78), when compared to their absence. Conclusions: Pleural fluid microbiological positivity is independently associated with increased mortality in patients with pleural infections. This finding should complement the RAPID score in risk stratification and inform future research aimed at improving outcomes in this patient population. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218413948,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Kuntzman K.; Håkansson K.E.J.; Ulrik C.S.; Rastogi D.,Impact of natal and childhood metabolic markers on childhood asthma burden – a nationwide cohort study,2025,Respiratory Research,10.1186/s12931-025-03321-7,"Background: Pediatric obesity, a risk factor for asthma, is increasing in prevalence. Obesity-mediated metabolic abnormalities are one of the mechanisms that link asthma and obesity. While maternal obesity contributes to obesity and respiratory morbidity in the child, the contribution of paternal obesity and parental metabolic abnormalities to the child’s asthma is not known. Methods: To quantify the impact of parental and child’s body weight and metabolic traits, including elevated HbA1c, and blood cholesterol levels based on national, age-specific cut-off values, on asthma exacerbations, control, and severity, in a Danish nationwide cohort of 29,851 children aged 2–17 years with inhaled corticosteroid-treated asthma during 2015–17. Results: Among the 29,851 children, 1,430 had severe asthma, 4,750 had poor asthma control, and 2,353 had exacerbating asthma. Elevated LDL in the child was associated with 2.2-fold higher odds of severe asthma and elevated triglycerides with 1.5-fold higher odds of exacerbating asthma, while reduced HDL was associated with 1.5-fold higher odds of poor control. Both triglycerides and HDL were associated with 1.5-fold higher odds of exacerbating asthma. Maternal parameters including elevated LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1C were associated with 1.2 to 1.4-fold higher odds of uncontrolled asthma in the child. Elevated paternal HbA1C was associated with exacerbating asthma. Conclusion: Dyslipidemia, including elevated LDL and decreased HDL, in the child and their parents was associated with high asthma burden in a Danish pediatric cohort with persistent asthma. These observations highlight the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms driven by fat metabolism that are transgenerational. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010627702,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Identifying prognostic biomarkers may improve risk stratification and guide personalized interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term prognostic value of circulating biomarkers related to inflammation, metabolic stress, and organ damage in individuals with T2D. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on a cohort of 478 individuals with T2D, followed for a median of 16.1 years. Ten circulating biomarkers (IL-6, IL-10, CD163, CXCL9, CCL22, GDF15, IL-33, FGF21, Follistatin, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were quantified using an automated immunoassay platform. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess their prognostic significance for all-cause mortality. A biomarker-based scoring model was developed by integrating independent predictors of mortality. Predictive performance was evaluated in comparison with the RECODe equation, a validated risk model for diabetes complications and mortality. Results: Deceased individuals exhibited significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10, CXCL9, FGF21, NfL, and GDF15. Biomarker levels correlated with both microvascular and macrovascular complications, particularly neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, four biomarkers emerged as independent predictors of mortality: CXCL9 (HR per 1 SD increase 1.19, 95% CI 1.05–1.36, p = 0.006), GDF15 (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.33, p = 0.032), NfL (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09–1.43, p = 0.001), and FGF21 (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04–1.37, p = 0.009). A composite biomarker score (range: 4–12) stratified individuals into distinct risk categories, with each 1-point increase in the score associated with a 55% higher mortality risk (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.35–1.74, p < 0.001). The biomarker score remained independently predictive after adjusting for clinical covariates and significantly improved individual-level risk classification beyond the RECODe model, as demonstrated by net reclassification and discrimination improvement metrics. Conclusions: These findings suggest that inflammatory and metabolic stress-related biomarkers independently predict long-term mortality in T2D. The biomarker-based scoring model enhances risk stratification and improves the prognostic performance of existing clinical tools, such as the RECODe equation, potentially informing targeted clinical interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010228810,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a key antigen in vaccine design. However, its low immunogenicity has been a hurdle, resulting in the production of minimal anti-RBD antibodies even when combined with alum adjuvant. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), secreted by Gram-negative bacteria, are nanospherical structures that can display or deliver antigens while also providing adjuvant activity through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Results: In this study, we utilized the SpyTag (ST)/SpyCatcher (SC) bioconjugation system to couple OMV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD in vitro. We successfully prepared a ‘plug-and-display’ nanovaccine OMV-RBD, which demonstrated good safety profiles and promoted the uptake of antigens by DCs and the maturation of BMDCs by activating TLR3 and NOD2 signaling pathways. Both intranasal and intramuscular immunization with OMV-RBD vaccine elicited robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Importantly, the induced antibodies effectively inhibited the binding of RBD to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. Conclusions: This vaccine platform offers an alternative strategy for developing recombinant subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, potentially enhancing immune responses and improving vaccine efficacy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218083107,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

AGuIX-Bi represents a theranostic NP comprising gadolinium and bismuth chelates grafted on a polysiloxane core. We hypothesize that modulating the surface of AGuIX-Bi with targeted peptides will enhance the therapeutic responses of radiation therapy. The cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) peptide has a high affinity to RGD-binding integrins overexpressed on various tumor cells, including lung cancer. In the present study, we introduced cRGD peptides onto the surface of AGuIX-Bi NPs using a PEG spacer to form an amide bond with the free amino functions present at the surface of the NPs. In vitro, AGuIX-Bi-cRGD showed enhanced internalization of NPs via integrin binding and increased radiosensitization. In murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors, AGuIX-Bi-cRGD exhibited increased accumulation and retention in tumors without causing systemic toxicity. Combined with fractionated irradiation, AGuIX-Bi-cRGD converted a “cold” LLC tumor microenvironment (TME) into a “hot” one by inducing the overexpression of the immunogenic cell death marker HMGB1 and increasing the density of tumor-infiltrating CD3+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and thereby delaying tumor growth and improving mice survival. Therefore, these results suggest a potential strategy for using targeted AGuIX-Bi-cRGD NPs to sensitize lung tumors to radiation and immunotherapies. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009542541,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Nevertheless, the role of lipids in the early steps of carcinogenesis is unknown. Although we previously identified two types of pancreatic fatty infiltration with different lipid compositions that were associated with precancerous lesions and fibrosis, their mechanisms of action have not been clarified. Methods: We hypothesized that saturated palmitic acid and mono-unsaturated oleic acid (OA and PA) could play diverse roles in the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) during the genesis of pancreatic fibrosis and the promotion of precancerous lesions. This study explored the lipotoxic effect of OA and PA on PSCs and exocrine pancreatic tissue (acinar cells). We also explored PA-induced pyroptosis in PSCs. A three-dimensional culture system of organotypic slices from human pancreatic tissues was used as well as a two-dimensional culture of hTERT immortalized PSCs. Results: The results show that PA could induce the secretion of collagens and inflammatory cytokines (IL18) in PSCs (p < 0.05). We defined a standardized protocol of precision-cut pancreas slices cultured from human non-tumoral pancreatic tissue (n = 9). Both OA and PA are involved in the initiation of acinar cell transformation into ductal cells. OA was found to have a protective effect against PA-induced fibrosis (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results highlight the antagonistic roles of oleic and palmitic acids in the initiation of pancreatic fibrosis and show that palmitic acid has a profibrotic role. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002969085,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Outcomes are heterogeneous, and accurate risk stratification is important to identify the highest risk individuals for treatment and to help prevent disease progression. The Oxford classification (OC) is an internationally adopted standard for renal biopsy reporting in IgAN, which measures the degree of histological abnormalities and predicts prognosis. The kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) was developed to predict kidney failure in all causes of CKD and has been shown to be highly accurate across diverse etiologies. This review aimed to compare the KFRE with formulae incorporating the OC in accurately determining the risk of kidney failure in IgAN. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane library guidelines and PRISMA statement for reporting of systematic reviews. Studies comparing the accuracy of the KFRE with the OC in predicting disease progression and kidney failure in IgAN were evaluated. The search strategy and analysis were performed independently by two reviewers. Studies that were eligible for inclusion compared the KFRE with any tool incorporating the OC in a cohort of individuals with IgAN. Eligible outcomes were reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and prognostic tools were required to assess the accuracy of these formulae by discrimination and/or calibration. Results: After searching several databases, only one study was eligible for inclusion in the review. This study of 2300 Chinese individuals with IgAN had a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Two-hundred eighty-eight individuals had a composite outcome of 50% decline in eGFR or ESRD, and 214 individuals developed ESRD. Both the KFRE and the IgAN Risk Prediction (IRP) tool (incorporating the OC) were highly accurate at predicting ESRD with a C-statistic of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. Subgroup analysis demonstrated improved performance of IRP over KFRE in discrimination for individuals with preserved eGFR (> 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) at baseline. The risk of bias was high due to insufficient follow-up and handling of missing data, so overall confidence in findings is very low. Conclusion: There is currently insufficient evidence to compare the accuracy of the KFRE and OC in determining outcomes in IgAN. Further research is required in this field.

However, similar progress has not been observed in India, with induction mortality rates surpassing those in high-income countries. Our patient population also differs significantly from those in clinical trials, with about 50% ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Yet, because of limited access to newer therapies and high costs, most of these patients receive intensive therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS In this study, we retrospectively classified patients who received intensive induction into fit and unfit groups on the basis of landmark trial criteria. Data were extracted from the Indian Acute Leukemia Research Database, a prospective registry maintained under the Hematology Cancer Consortium. The primary objective was induction mortality.RESULTS We analyzed 385 patients with AML treated between 2017 and 2019. The median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range, 15-61). Induction mortality was reported at 6.1% in the fit cohort and 20.2% in the unfit cohort (odds ratio, 3.91 [1.97-7.74]; P <.0001). Factors such as increased age, poor performance status, baseline infection, and low albumin were associated with a poor prognosis for early death. After a median follow-up of 19.2 months, the 2-year overall survival in the overall, fit, and unfit cohorts was 62.7%, 67%, and 58.1%, respectively.CONCLUSION Our findings highlight the baseline characteristics of our patient population and their impact on the outcomes of induction therapy. Unfit patients who received intensive chemotherapy had higher induction mortality and lower overall survival. © 2025 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000000355,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between GAP versus GC. Median OS with GAP was 14.0 months (95% CI, 12.4 to 16.1) and 13.6 months with GC (95% CI, 9.7 to 16.6); hazard ratio (HR), 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.14); P =.41. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was similar between groups with median PFS for GAP being 7.5 months (95% CI, 6.4 to 8.5) versus 6.3 months for GC (95% CI, 4.4 to 8.2); HR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.12); P =.32.

Kappa free light chain (KFLC) quantification in serum and CSF has recently been proposed as an additional test. In a rational medicoeconomic approach, identifying algorithms or biomarkers is important. The objective of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the correlation between CSF kappa free light chain (KFLCCSF)/total CSF protein ratio (KFLCCSF/ProtCSF) and OCB status and its performance in diagnosing MS. Methods KFLC measurements were performed prospectively with each OCB analysis, and the data were interpreted retrospectively. A total of 814 clinical cases were included: 153 with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 181 with other inflammatory neurologic diseases, and 480 with noninflammatory neurologic diseases. Performances of KFLCCSF/ProtCSF in predicting OCB status, diagnosing MS, and estimating evolution of CIS to MS were evaluated and compared with those of other KFLC parameters, i.e., KFLC index, and with OCB and IgG parameters. Results KFLCCSF/ProtCSF and KFLC index performed similarly in predicting OCB status, with a sensitivity of 80.2% and a specificity of 93.4% at a threshold >0.21% for KFLCCSF/ProtCSF (area under the curve: 0.93). The percentage of agreement between OCB status and KFLCCSF/ProtCSF was 91.2%. Using KFLCCSF and KFLCCSF/ProtCSF initially could reduce OCB testing by 68% and quantitative tests by 48.4%. For diagnosing MS/CIS, KFLCCSF/ProtCSF performed similar to or slightly worse than the KFLC index but always outperformed IgG, OCB, and KFLCCSF. For this indication, the optimal threshold for KFLCCSF/ProtCSF was >0.24%. It is important to note that KFLCCSF/ProtCSF was the most predictive parameter for CIS progression to MS. Discussion To conclude, KFLCCSF/ProtCSF is as an easier and cost-effective alternative for predicting OCB status and CIS progression to MS and assisting in the diagnosis of MS. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class II evidence that the KFLCCSF/ProteinCSF ratio accurately distinguishes patients with CSF OCBs from those without CSF OCBs and patients with MS from those with other neurologic disorders. © 2025 The Author(s).

Because FcRn is a multifunctional protein expressed in different immune system cells, including B cells, we investigated whether FcRn blockade by EFG may have further immunologic effects, other than IgG reduction, in patients with MG.MethodsAnti-acetylcholine receptor Ab-positive (AChR-MG) patients were treated with EFG according to the GENERATIVE protocol. Clinical evaluation, IgG and autoAb quantification, and circulating T-cell and B-cell subpopulation analyses by flow cytometry were performed at different time points. The expression of regulatory plasma cell-related candidate genes (CD38, lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG3], IL-12a, Ebi3) was assessed by real-time PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients on treatment and in PBMCs either untreated or in vitro treated with an EFG-mimicking anti-FcRn monoclonal Ab (mAb) or with EFG (Vyvgart).ResultsA significantly increased percentage of CD19+/CD27+ memory B cells and CD27+/CD138+ plasma cells was observed at the end of EFG treatment cycle 1 and cycle 2 in patients with AChR-MG. Plasma cell increase, maintained up to cycle 3, significantly correlated with Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score improvement. Moreover, PBMCs from EFG-treated patients showed overexpression of CD38, LAG3, and IL-12a genes, suggesting EFG's ability to induce non-pathogenic regulatory plasma cells. This ability was confirmed in vitro, because anti-FcRn mAb-treated and EFG-treated PBMCs displayed an up-regulation of CD38 and LAG3 compared with untreated cells.DiscussionOur findings indicate an unknown immunoregulatory action of EFG in patients with AChR-MG, by unraveling a drug effect on B-cell differentiation, and suggest the induction of regulatory plasma cells as a further mechanism, beyond IgG reduction, associated with clinical improvement. A deep understanding of the immunologic effects of EFG can help to optimize its usage over time in individual patients and disclose biomarkers suitable for monitoring the long-term patient-specific response.  © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012305493,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In this study, we aimed to investigate the natural course of the function of lower extremity small and large nerve fibers in people with NGT and its decline in those with well-controlled type 2 diabetes. Methods This prospective observational study assessed changes in nerve function in participants of the German Diabetes Study with recently diagnosed (≤1 year) type 2 diabetes and age-matched and sex-matched individuals with NGT after 5 years and in a larger group of participants with type 2 diabetes after 5 and 10 years. Reference tests of lower extremity peripheral nerve function included peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), malleolar vibration perception threshold (VPT), and thermal detection thresholds (TDTs). Data were analyzed using multiple linear or logistic regression analyses. Results At baseline, all 5 nerve function measures showed impairment in the 52 individuals in the diabetes group (33% female, median age 51.7 years) compared with the 52 individuals in the matched NGT group (33% female, median age 51.4 years). After 5 years, 2 nerve indices declined in the diabetes group (peroneal MNCV and VPT) and 3 in the NGT group (peroneal MNCV, VPT, and TDT for cold), with similar 5-year declines observed in both groups after adjustment for baseline values and pairwise matching. In addition, the Neuropathy Disability Score increased in the NGT group but not in the diabetes group. Comparable patterns of decline after 5 and 10 years were found in the larger diabetes cohort of 141 individuals (39% female, median baseline age 53.6 years). The observed 10-year prevalence of abnormal NCVs closely matched estimates based on natural aging-related decline (14.2% vs 12.8% for peroneal MNCV and 30.2% vs 31.0% for sural SNCV). Discussion These findings suggest that nerve function deterioration in well-controlled type 2 diabetes is primarily influenced by nerve function status at diagnosis and physiologic aging, rather than diabetes-related progression.

Methods: This study included 300 HCC patients who underwent TACE treatment. Based on whether persistent albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade deterioration (PABD) occurred after the initial TACE, defining as a shift in ALBI grade to a higher grade from baseline without recovery within 90 days, patients were divided into PABD and non-PABD groups. Overall survival of non-PABD and PABD groups according to subgroups stratified by baseline ALBI grade and tumour burden was compared with that of patients receiving only sorafenib or supportive care during the same period. Results: Repeat TACE provided a survival benefit over systemic therapy or supportive care for patients in all post-TACE non-PABD or most PABD subgroups, regardless of baseline liver condition (ie, modified albumin–bilirubin [mALBI] grade and tumour burden). This benefit was absent in two subgroups among patients who developed PABD after the initial TACE, namely, (1) those with a baseline liver condition of mALBI grade 1 or 2a and tumour burden exceeding the up-to-11 criteria, and (2) those with a baseline liver condition of mALBI grade 2b, regardless of tumour burden. Conclusion: Repeat TACE is not recommended for patients with persistent liver function deterioration after the initial TACE, particularly those exhibiting suboptimal baseline liver function or excessive tumour burden. Understanding the liver condition and tumour burden in HCC patients may assist clinicians in planning optimal treatment strategies, leading to better prognosis. ©2025 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219612859,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Previous research linked PFAS exposure to female reproductive disorders, but the mechanism remains elusive. Further, most studies focused on legacy long-chain PFOA and PFOS, yet the reproductive impacts of other long-chain PFAS and short-chain alternatives are rarely explored. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of long-and short-chain PFAS on the mouse ovary and further evaluated the toxic mechanisms of long-chain perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). METHODS: A 3D in vitro mouse ovarian follicle culture system and an in vivo mouse model were used, together with approaches of reverse transcription– quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), pharmacological treat-ments, in situ zymography, histology, in situ hybridization, analytical chemistry, and benchmark dose modeling (BMD). Using these approaches, a wide range of exposure levels (1–250 lM) of long-chain PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFNA) and short-chain PFAS (PFHpA, PFBS, GenX) were first tested in cultured follicles to examine their effects on follicle growth, hormone secretion, and ovulation. We identified 250 lM as the most effective concentration for further investigation into the toxic mechanisms of PFNA, followed by an in vivo mouse exposure model to verify the accumulation of PFNA in the ovary and its ovarian-disrupting effects. RESULTS: In vitro cultured ovarian follicles exposed to long-but not short-chain PFAS showed poorer gonadotropin-dependent follicle growth, ovulation, and hormone secretion in comparison with control follicles. RT-qPCR and RNA-seq analyses revealed significant alterations in the expression of genes involved in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)–dependent follicle growth, luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated ovulation, and associated regulatory pathways in the PFNA-exposed group in comparison with the control group. The PPAR agonist experiment demonstrated that a peroxisome proliferator– activated receptor gamma (PPARc) antagonist could reverse both the phenotypic and genotypic effects of PFNA exposure, restoring them to levels compa-rable to the control group. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that PFNA could accumulate in ovarian tissues and validated the in vitro findings. The BMD, in vitro, and in vivo extrapolation analyses estimated follicular rupture as the most sensitive end point and that observed effects occurred in the range of human exposure to long-chain PFAS. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates that long-chain PFAS, particularly PFNA, act as a PPARc agonist in granulosa cells to interfere with gonadotropin-dependent follicle growth, hormone secretion, and ovulation; and exposure to high levels of PFAS may cause adverse ovarian out-comes. © 2025, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Huang Z.; Niu R.; Xu Q.; Zhang R.; Hu W.; Qin Y.; Wang X.; Xu Q.; Xia Y.; Fan Y.; Lu C.,Impact of Maternal BPA Exposure during Pregnancy on Obesity in Male Offspring: A Mechanistic Mouse Study of Adipose-Derived Exosomal miRNA,2025,Environmental Health Perspectives,10.1289/EHP14888,"BACKGROUND: The widespread use of bisphenol A (BPA) has led to universal exposure among the population, raising concerns about its health effects. Epidemiological studies have linked environmentally relevant levels of BPA exposure to obesity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to uncover the complex mechanisms by which oral exposure during pregnancy with BPA affects the offspring. METHODS: We conducted a two-stage mouse study. In stage 1, we gavaged dams with BPA at 0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg/kg per day during pregnancy, and we tracked the offspring’s weight and diet to 12 wk of age. In stage 2, exosomes from BPA-exposed dams and offspring were injected into pregnant mice and 3-wk-old males, respectively, and the mice were observed up to 12 wk. We then sequenced exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in male offspring whose dams had been exposed to BPA during pregnancy and checked their expression in adipose, liver, and serum samples at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Finally, we explored the functions of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs secreted by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and we investigated whether the exosomes and miRNAs they secreted could affect glucose uptake, triglyceride synthesis, and the expression of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism in alpha mouse liver 12 cells. RESULTS: Gavage of 0:05 mg/kg per day of BPA during pregnancy in dams led to obesity in male offspring mice, and injection of exosomes from male offspring with BPA exposure during pregnancy also induced similar outcomes in the next generation of male pups. Exosomal miRNA sequencing identified differentially expressed miRNAs associated with BPA-induced obesity in male offspring, revealing sustained high expression of miRNAs in adipose tissue and a gradual increase in the liver and serum over time. Further mechanistic studies showed that exosomes derived from BPA-treated adipose-derived stem cells reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and fibroblast growth factor 21, leading to impaired insulin signaling and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. Overexpression of miR-124-3p in hepatocytes mimicked these effects; in contrast, knockdown of miR-124-3p or inhibition of exosome secretion reversed them. DISCUSSION: The present study corroborates the regulatory function of adipose-derived exosomal miRNAs in obesity in male offspring mice resulting from BPA exposure during pregnancy. Exosomal miRNA may be a key and novel molecular biomarker in the adverse effects of chemical exposure during pregnancy. © 2025, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are a complex set of modified proteins or lipids by non-enzymatic glycosylation and oxidation. The formation of AGEs is irreversible, and they accumulate in tissues with increasing age. Currently, AGEs, as a biomarker of ageing, are viewed as a risk factor for sarcopenia. AGE accumulation could cause harmful effects in the human body such as elevated inflammation levels, enhanced oxidative stress, and targeted glycosylation of proteins inside and outside the cells. Several studies have illustrated the pathogenic role of AGEs in sarcopenia, which includes promoting skeletal muscle atrophy, impairing muscle regeneration, disrupting the normal structure of skeletal muscle extracellular matrix, and contributing to neuromuscular junction lesion and vascular disorders. This article reviews studies focused on the pathogenic role of AGEs in sarcopenia and the potential mechanisms of the detrimental effects, aiming to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and develop novel methods for the prevention and therapy of sarcopenia. © 2025 Guo et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001931381,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Existing detection methods, such as qPCR and ELISA, fail to simultaneously meet the requirements for high sensitivity, high specificity, and rapid detection. This study presents an innovative approach for the rapid, specific, and highly sensitive detection of pathogenic microorganisms, particularly Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), by combining recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The qualitative and quantitative detection method for pathogenic microorganisms was developed and evaluated. The stable and efficient RPA reaction systems were established to specifically amplify the key conserved genes of these pathogens. Then the RPA products were purified, and enriched with MBs. The absorbance spectra were obtained using THz-TDS technology. The linear range of the RPA-THz for detecting E. coli O157:H7 was 0.55 to 5.5 × 104 pg/mL, while for VZV, it was 0.75 to 7.5 × 103 pg/mL. The limit of detection (LOD) for bacteria and viruses was 0.226 pg/mL and 0.528 pg/mL, respectively, demonstrating better sensitivity than the qPCR (550 pg/mL and 750 pg/mL, respectively). In addition, the whole amplification and detection process was completed in about 35 minutes. Compared to traditional pathogen detection techniques, the primary advantage of the developed RPA-THz method exhibited high accuracy, good reproducibility, and short detection times, enabling non-ionizing, label-free analysis for rapid detection with high sensitivity and specificity of pathogenic microorganisms. This study provides a theoretical foundation and practical demonstration for the fast and precise detection of pathogenic microorganisms. It establishes a crucial research basis for further development of RPA-THz sensors, advancing technological progress in the field of food safety, medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and public health. © 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219116911,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This setup involves splicing a segment of multimode fiber (MMF) and no-core fiber (NCF) between a single-mode fiber (SMF), followed by a functionalization procedure with a composite of graphene oxide (GO)-cysteamine (MEA) and chitosan (CS)-Cd2+ imprinted polymer (Cd2+IP). The sensitivity of the sensors has been calculated by monitoring the interference minima. Three identical probes have been fabricated to ensure the duplicability and the highest sensing sensitivity is measured at -0.1211 nm/ parts per billion (ppb) in the cadmium detection range of 0 ppb to 10 ppb with a response time of 90 s. The probe demonstrates a high selectivity for Cd2+ compared to other heavy metal ions. The response of the probe in various pH solutions has been investigated to minimize the sensing error.

Aguilar G.R.; Vidal B.; Ji H.; Evenblij J.; Liao C.-P.; Ji H.; Valperga G.; Fang-Yen C.; Hobert O.,Functional analysis of conserved C. elegans bHLH family members uncovers lifespan control by a peptidergic hub neuron,2025,PLoS Biology,10.1371/journal.pbio.3002979,"Throughout the animal kingdom, several members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family act as proneural genes during early steps of nervous system development. Roles of bHLH genes in specifying terminal differentiation of postmitotic neurons have been less extensively studied. We analyze here the function of 5 Caenorhabditis elegans bHLH genes, falling into 3 phylogenetically conserved subfamilies, which are continuously expressed in a very small number of postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system. We show (a) that 2 orthologs of the vertebrate bHLHe22/e23 genes, called hlh-17 and hlh-32, function redundantly to specify the identity of a single head interneuron class (AUA), as well as an individual motor neuron (VB2); (b) that the PTF1a ortholog hlh-13 acts as a terminal selector to control terminal differentiation and function of the sole octopaminergic neuron class in C. elegans, RIC; and (c) that the NHLH1/2 ortholog hlh-15 controls terminal differentiation and function of the peptidergic AVK head interneuron class, a known neuropeptidergic signaling hub in the animal. Strikingly, through null mutant analysis and cell-specific rescue experiments, we find that loss of hlh-15/NHLH in the peptidergic AVK neurons and the resulting abrogation of neuropeptide secretion from these neurons causes a substantially extended lifespan of the animal, which we propose to be akin to hypothalamic control of lifespan in vertebrates. Our functional analysis reveals themes of bHLH gene function during terminal differentiation that are complementary to the earlier lineage specification roles of other bHLH family members. However, such late functions are much more sparsely employed by members of the bHLH transcription factor family, compared to the function of the much more broadly employed homeodomain transcription factor family.  © 2025 Aguilar et al.

There is accumulating evidence that iKIRs regulate T cell-mediated immunity. Recently, we reported that T cell-mediated control was enhanced by iKIRs in chronic viral infections. We hypothesized that in the context of autoimmunity, where an enhanced T cell response might be considered detrimental, iKIRs would have an opposite effect. We studied Type 1 diabetes (T1D) as a paradigmatic example of autoimmunity. In T1D, variation in the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) genes explains up to 50% of the genetic risk, indicating that T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis. To investigate if iKIRs affect this T cell response we asked whether HLA associations were modified by iKIR genes. We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset (N = 11,961) and found that iKIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, have a consistent and significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations. Our results were validated in an independent data set. We conclude that iKIRs significantly decrease HLA class II protective associations and suggest that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D. © 2024 Mora-Bitria et al.

If used in pregnancy, these lower thresholds may identify women at increased risk of adverse outcomes, which would be particularly useful to risk-stratify nulliparous women. In this secondary analysis of the SCOPE cohort, we asked whether, among standard-risk nulliparous women, the ACC/AHA BP categories could identify women at increased risk for adverse outcomes. Methods and findings Included were pregnancies in the international SCOPE cohort with birth at >20 weeks’ gestation, 2004 to 2008. Women were mostly of white ethnicity, in their 20s, and of normal-to-overweight body mass index (BMI). Excluded were pregnancies ending in fetal loss at <20 weeks’ gestation, and those terminated at any point in pregnancy. Women were categorized by highest BP during pregnancy, using ACC/AHA criteria: normal (BP <120/80 mmHg), “Elevated BP” (BP 120 to 129 mmHg/<80 mmHg), “Stage-1 hypertension” (systolic BP [sBP] 130 to 139 mmHg or diastolic BP [dBP] 80 to 89 mmHg), and “Stage-2 hypertension” that was non-severe (sBP 140 to 159 mmHg or dBP 90 to 109 mmHg) or severe (sBP >160 mmHg or dBP >110 mmHg). Primary outcomes were preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight, postpartum hemorrhage, and neonatal care admission. Adjusted relative risks (aRRs) and diagnostic test properties were calculated for each outcome, according to: each BP category (versus “normal”), and using the lower limit of each BP category as a cut-off. RRs were adjusted for maternal age, BMI, smoking, ethnicity, and alcohol use. Of 5,628 women in SCOPE, 5,597 were included in this analysis. When compared with normotension, severe “Stage 2 hypertension” was associated with PTB (24.0% versus 5.3%; aRR 4.88, 95% confidence interval, CI [3.46 to 6.88]), birthweight <10th centile (24.4% versus 8.8%; aRR 2.70 [2.00 to 3.65]), and neonatal unit admission (32.9% versus 8.9%; aRR 3.40 [2.59 to 4.46]). When compared with normotension, non-severe “Stage 2 hypertension” was associated with birthweight <10th centile (16.1% versus 8.8%; aRR 1.82 [1.45 to 2.29]) and neonatal unit admission (15.4% versus 8.9%; aRR 1.65 [1.31 to 2.07]), but no association with adverse outcomes was seen with BP categories below “Stage 2 hypertension.” When each BP category was assessed as a threshold for diagnosis of abnormal BP (compared with BP values below), only severe “Stage 2 hypertension” had a useful (good) likelihood ratio (LR) of 5.09 (95% CI [3.84 to 6.75]) for PTB. No BP threshold could rule-out adverse outcomes (i.e., had a negative LR <0.2). Limitations of our analysis include lack of ethnic diversity and use of values from clinical notes for BP within 2 weeks before birth. This study was limited by: its retrospective nature, not all women having BP recorded at all visits, and the lack of detail about some outcomes. Conclusions In this study, we observed that 2017 ACC/AHA BP categories demonstrated a similar pattern of association and diagnostic test properties in nulliparous women, as seen in the general obstetric population. BP thresholds below the currently used “Stage 2 hypertension” were not associated with PTB, low birthweight, postpartum hemorrhage, or neonatal unit admission. This study does not support implementation of lower BP values as abnormal in nulliparous pregnant women. Copyright: © 2025 Slade et al.

This study aimed to uncover the relationship between scrub typhus and autoimmune responses, focusing on antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and the implications of elevated ANA titers during infection. Method Data from a total of 139 patients diagnosed with scrub typhus and 30 healthy controls were retrospectively analyzed through serum samples to assess the levels of ANAs and related autoantibodies. The study further examined the temporal variation of these antibody titers in relation to post-symptom progression and evaluated their association with clinical and laboratory parameters. Results The study results detail significant differences in autoimmune responses between scrub typhus patients and healthy controls. ANA titers above 1:80 were detected in 71.2% of patients; these titers were elevated in only 13.3% of the healthy controls. High-titer positivity (1:640 or higher) was observed exclusively in the scrub typhus group. The distribution of ANA titers revealed a progressive increase in mean ANA and double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid Immunoglobulin M (anti-dsDNA IgM) titers as the duration after symptom onset increased, indicating an augmented immune response over time. This trend was observed along with a systematic elevation in median anti-dsDNA IgM titers, highlighting the dynamic nature of immune responses in scrub typhus infection. Conclusion Our findings conclude a substantial autoimmunological reaction in scrub typhus patients, suggesting potential mimicry of autoimmune conditions like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. These results underline the complex interplay between infectious diseases and autoimmunity, emphasizing the necessity for further research into these mechanisms and their clinical implications. © 2025 You et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217357698,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

There is still limited data on how much resuscitated fluid and the specific ratios of intravenous fluid types contribute to the development of severe respiratory distress necessitating mechanical ventilation (MV) and AKI in children with DSS. Methodology/principal findings This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Vietnam between 2013 and 2022. The primary outcomes were the need for MV and renal function within 48 h post-admission. A predictive model for MV was developed based on covariates from the first 24 h of PICU admission. Changes in renal function within 48 h were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. A total of 1,278 DSS children with complete clinical and fluid data were included. The predictive performance of MV based on the total intravenous fluid volume administered yielded an AUC of 0.871 (95% CI, 0.836–0.905), while the colloid-tocrystalloid ratio showed an AUC of 0.781 (95% CI, 0.743–0.819) (both P < 0.001). The optimal cut-off point of the cumulative fluid infusion was 181 mL/kg, whereas that of the colloidto-crystalloid ratio was 1.6. Multivariable analysis identified female patients, severe bleeding, severe transaminitis, excessive fluid resuscitation, and a higher proportion of colloid solutions in the first 24 h as significant predictors of MV in DSS patients. The predictive model for MV demonstrated high accuracy, with a C-statistic of 89%, strong calibration, and low Brier score (0.04). Importantly, a more pronounced decline in glomerular filtration rate was observed in DSS patients who required MV than in those who did not. Conclusions/significance This study provides insights into optimizing fluid management protocols, highlighting the importance of monitoring fluid volume and the colloid-to-crystalloid ratio during early resuscitation to improve the clinical outcomes of DSS patients. © 2025 Luan et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216715259,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Today, basic knowledge of this neglected disease and how to predict its progression remain largely unknown. Methods and findings This study addresses the use of several biochemical, haematological and immunological variables, independently or through unsupervised machine learning (ML), to predict PKDL progression risk. In 110 patients from Sudan, 31 such factors were assessed in relation to PKDL disease state at the time of diagnosis: progressive (worsening) versus stable. To identify key factors associated with PKDL worsening, we used both a conventional statistical approach and multivariate analysis through unsupervised ML. The independent use of these variables had limited power to predict skin lesion severity in a baseline examination. In contrast, the unsupervised ML approach identified a set of 10 non-redundant variables that was linked to a 3.1 times higher risk of developing progressive PKDL. Three of these clustering factors (low albumin level, low haematocrit and low IFN-γ production in PBMCs after Leishmania antigen stimulation) were remarkable in patients with progressive dis-ease. Dimensionality re-establishment identified 11 further significantly modified factors that are also important to understand the worsening phenotype. Our results indicate that the combination of anaemia and a weak Th1 immunological response is likely the main physiological mechanism that leads to progressive PKDL. Conclusions A combination of 14 biochemical variables identified by unsupervised ML was able to detect a worsening PKDL state in Sudanese patients. This approach could prove instrumental to train future supervised algorithms based on larger patient cohorts both for a more precise diagnosis and to gain insight into fundamental aspects of this complication of visceral leishmaniasis. © 2025 Torres et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002082710,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Pan L.; Wu C.; Li P.; Huang J.; Wu Y.; Li G.,A model predicting the 6-year all cause mortality of patients with advanced schistosomiasis after discharge: Derived from a large population-based cohort study,2025,PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases,10.1371/journal.pntd.0013134,"Background Advanced schistosomiasis imposed a heavy economic burden on society and had a high rate of mortality and disability. However, methods for assessing its long-term prognosis were currently insufficient, and there was a lack of predictive tools to aid clinical decision-making and personalized follow-up plans for patients. We sought to determine risk factors associated with six-year all-cause mortality in advanced schistosomiasis, deriving and validating a six-year all-cause mortality prediction model through a retrospective cohort study based on a large population-based cohort. Methodology We collected information from 4,136 patients with advanced schistosomiasis who were discharged between December 2014 and January 2015. After excluding 17 patients with the less common subtypes of colonic tumoroid proliferation and dwarf-ism, as well as 92 patients who were lost to follow-up or had incomplete information, data from 4,027 patients were included in the study. These patients were randomly assigned to the derivation cohort and the external validation cohort in a 7:3 ratio, with 1,400 patients randomly selected from the derivation cohort for internal validation. Sixteen candidate variables were collected: age, gender, nutritional status, splenectomy history, presence of other conditions (such as cardiovascular and digestive diseases), clinical classification, disease duration, ascites occurrence frequency, levels of serum total bilirubin (TBil), direct bilirubin (DBil), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin (ALB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). High-risk factors associated with the 6-year mortality outcome were identified through univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. The predictive value of different models was evaluated and compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Akaike information criterion (AIC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), C statistic, and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Findings The derivation cohort comprised 2819 patients and we randomly selected 1400 cases from this cohort for internal validation. The external cohort consisted of 1208 patients. The mortality rate for three groups was around 27%-28%. We identified ten variables associated with increased risk of death, including age, course of disease, frequence of ascites, hepatitis B co-infection, and levels of DBil, ALT, AST, ALP, ALB, and AFP at baseline. Using these variables, we developed a ten-variable model and three simpler models. In the derivation cohort, the ten-variable model showed the highest C statistic (0.759; 95% CI, 0.739-0.778) and the lowest AIC (2834.2). ROC curves indicated an AUC of 0.759 for the ten-variable model, outperforming the simpler models. External validation also demonstrated superior performance of the ten-variable model with a higher C statistic (0.774; 95% CI, 0.749-0.797). This model consistently showed better results in ROC curves, IDI, continuous NRI, and categorical NRI analyses compared to the reduced models in external validation cohort. Conclusions This study developed a multivariate model to predict the 6-year all-cause mortality rate in patients with advanced schistosomiasis, which demonstrated good performance. This convenient tool may potentially assist clinicians in formulating patient follow-up plans. © 2025 Pan et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008484453,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We optimized the energy composition and antioxidant substances of sperm culture medium in vitro (based on Ham’s F10 culture medium) by orthogonal test for preparing high quality culture medium. Sperms of 60 patients with idiopathic severe asthenospermia were collected, and cultured in vitro within 24h, by Ham’s F10 culture medium added to different concentrations of L-carnitine and fructose and culture temperature, whose effects on sperm motility were observed to determine which is the most appropriate concentration and temperature. For determining the appropriate concentration of L-carnitine and fructose and the suitable culture temperature in Ham’s F10 culture medium, the orthogonal experiments were carried out to optimize above three factors, which had great influence on sperm viability, survival rate, deformity rate and DNA fragmentation index (DFI). The final concentration of L-carnitine and fructose was determined in terms of initial tests to assess the effects of different concentrations (4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/ml L-carnitine and 0.125, 0.250, 0.375, and 0.50 mg/ml fructose) on sperm viability and motility in culture. During the operation of processing and culturing sperms in vitro within 24h, orthogonal test showed that sperm viability was better at the final concentration of 8 mg/ml L-carnitine and 0.375 mg/ml fructose in improved Ham’s F10 culture medium at 36.5◦C. Idiopathic severe asthenospermia sperm can be effectively improved by the modified Ham’s F10 culture medium of the final concentration of 8 mg/ml L-carnitine and 0.375 mg/ml fructose at 36.5◦C within 24h, which has shown better culture effect and is superior to Ham’s F10 basic medium. © 2025 Chang et al.

This study aimed to identify commonly mutated genes and altered pathways in canine solid tumors. Four dogs with different types of naturally occurring neoplasias (urothelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma) were randomly selected and classified into carcinoma and sarcoma groups based on histopathological findings. Tumor tissues were analyzed using whole-genome sequencing, and significant variants shared within each tumor group were identified. Gene set enrichment analyses were conducted to compare the biological and functional pathways altered by the mutations in each carcinoma and sarcoma group. Forty-three and fifty-eight genes were identified in the carcinoma and sarcoma groups, respectively. Distinctions between the two tumor groups were noted for mutations related to tumor metastatic function. Mutations were identified in genes encoding cell adhesion molecules in the carcinoma group, whereas significant variations in extracellular matrix-related molecules were evident in the sarcoma group.

Takada H.; Osawa L.; Komiyama Y.; Muraoka M.; Suzuki Y.; Sato M.; Kobayashi S.; Yoshida T.; Takano S.; Maekawa S.; Enomoto N.,Serum interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 levels can help predict sarcopenia development in patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma: A retrospective cohort study,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0309852,"Background Sarcopenia is a prognostic factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism underlying sarcopenia development in these patients remains unclear. The chemokine interferon-gamma-induced protein 10/C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (IP-10) has been found to be associated with muscle regeneration or destruction. Thus, we aimed to clarify the role of serum IP-10 levels in predicting sarcopenia development in patients with HCC. Methods This retrospective study enrolled 120 patients with primary HCC whose serum IP-10 levels were measured both at baseline and 1 year after the confirmed diagnosis of HCC. Patients who had sarcopenia at baseline computed tomography imaging were assigned to the Sarco-base group, whereas those in whom sarcopenia was found for the first time after 3 years were assigned to the Sarco-develop group. Those who never met the criteria during the follow-up period were assigned to the Non-Sarco group. Results The baseline IP-10 levels were significantly lower in the Sarco-base group compared to the rest (p=0.016). Conversely baseline IP-10 levels and IP-10 ratio at 1 year were higher in the Sarco-develop group than in the Non-Sarco group (p=0.0017, p=0.025). High IP-10 levels at baseline, and high IP-10 ratios at 1 year were independently related factors for sarcopenia development.Conclusions Patients with sarcopenia at baseline more frequently presented with low IP-10 levels than those without. Contrarily, the group without sarcopenia at baseline and with high baseline IP-10 levels and high IP-10 ratios at 1 year were more likely to develop sarcopenia after 3 years. Monitoring of IP-10 levels may enable the identification of groups prone to develop sarcopenia in patients with HCC. © 2025 Takada et al.

Zhang H.; Liu J.; Su D.; Bai Z.; Wu Y.; Ma Y.; Miao Q.; Wang M.; Yang X.,Diagnostic of fatty liver using radiomics and deep learning models on non-contrast abdominal CT,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0310938,"Purpose This study aims to explore the potential of non-contrast abdominal CT radiomics and deep learning models in accurately diagnosing fatty liver. Materials and methods The study retrospectively enrolled 840 individuals who underwent non-contrast abdominal CT and quantitative CT (QCT) examinations at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from July 2022 to May 2023. Subsequently, these participants were divided into a training set (n = 539) and a testing set (n = 301) in a 9:5 ratio. The liver fat content measured by experienced radiologists using QCT technology served as the reference standard. The liver images from the non-contrast abdominal CT scans were then segmented as regions of interest (ROI) from which radiomics features were extracted. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) radiomics models, as well as 2D and 3D deep learning models, were developed, and machine learning models based on clinical data were constructed for the four-category diagnosis of fatty liver. The characteristic curves for each model were plotted, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated to assess their efficacy in the classification and diagnosis of fatty liver. Results A total of 840 participants were included (mean age 49.1 years ± 11.5 years [SD]; 581 males), of whom 610 (73%) had fatty liver. Among the patients with fatty liver, there were 302 with mild fatty liver (CT fat fraction of 5%–14%), 155 with moderate fatty liver (CT fat fraction of 14%–28%), and 153 with severe fatty liver (CT fat fraction >28%). Among all models used for diagnosing fatty liver, the 2D radiomics model based on the random forest algorithm achieved the highest AUC (0.973), while the 2D radiomics model based on the Bagging decision tree algorithm showed the highest sensitivity (0.873), specificity (0.939), accuracy (0.864), precision (0.880), and F1 score (0.876). Conclusion A systematic comparison was conducted on the performance of 2D and 3D radiomics models, as well as deep learning models, in the diagnosis of four-category fatty liver. This comprehensive model comparison provides a broader perspective for determining the optimal model for liver fat diagnosis. It was found that the 2D radiomics models based on the random forest and Bagging decision tree algorithms show high consistency with the QCT-based classification diagnosis of fatty liver used by experienced radiologists. © 2025 Zhang et al.

It is most often diagnosed in the advanced stages as precancerous lesions are often symptom-free and difficult to identify. Microwave imaging, especially in terahertz (THz) range, is a convenient and noninvasive cancer detection tool. It enables characterization of biological tissues and discrimination between healthy and malignant ones. This study presents a novel triple-band biosensor based on metamaterials (MTMs). By leveraging unique properties of MTMs, the proposed biosensor operates as a perfect absorber. It exploits resonant modes in the THz spectrum to achieve remarkable sensitivity. Meticulous selection of the sensor geometry and dimensions enables efficient miniaturization. Meanwhile, utilization of frequency-domain data to detect refractive index changes improves resolution of cancerous tissue identification. Extensive numerical investigations corroborate its ability to carry out reliable early-stage cervical cancer diagnosis. This includes identification of the spatial extent of the malignant tissue. Excellent electrical properties of the sensor are accompanied by its compact size, which is highly desirable for noninvasive and portable applications. © 2025 Hamza et al.

Vural A.; Dolanbay T.; Yagar H.,"Hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte and platelet (HALP) score for predicting early and late mortality in elderly patients with proximal femur fractures",2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0313842,"Background Predicting mortality and morbidity poses a significant challenge to physicians, leading to the development of various scoring systems. Among these, the hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte and platelet (HALP) score evaluates a patient’s nutritional and immune status. The primary aim of this study was to determine the predictive effect of the HALP score on 30-day and 1-year mortality in elderly patients with proximal femoral fractures (PFFs). Materials and methods Patient demographic, clinical, laboratory, and prognostic data were obtained. The patients were categorized into two groups: survival and nonsurvival at mortality endpoints. The HALP score was calculated and compared among the groups and with other mortality biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR). The ability of the HALP score to predict mortality was compared between the groups. The mortality risk was also calculated at the optimal threshold. Results The HALP score had a statistically significant predictive effect on mortality endpoints and was lower in the non-surviving group. The ability of the HALP score to predict 1-year mortality at the optimal cut-off value (17.975) was superb, with a sensitivity of 0.66 and specificity of 0.86 (AUC: 0.826, 95% CI: 0.784–0.868). In addition, the power of the HALP score to differentiate survivors and non-survivors was more significant than that of other indices (p < 0.001). Patients with a HALP score ≤ 17.975 had a 1-year mortality risk 11.794 times that of patients with a HALP score ≥ 17.975 (Odds ratio: 11.794, 95% CI [7.194–19.338], p < 0.001). Conclusion The results indicate that the HALP score demonstrates efficacy and utility in predicting 30-day and 1-year mortality risk among elderly patients with PFFs. Copyright: © 2025 Vural et al.

Zhou X.; Jiang B.; You N.; Qian X.; Han D.; Sun W.,Association between albumin infusion and sepsis risk of patients with acute pancreatitis,2025,PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0314738,"Objective To investigate whether early administration of serum albumin infusion in the acute pancreatitis (AP) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) reduces the risk of sepsis. Methods Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV databases for this retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was the occurrence of sepsis in AP patients. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to evaluate the association between albumin infusion and sepsis risk of AP patients. Additional subgroup analysis by stratification to serum albumin were also performed. Results The study included 779 patients with AP. They were divided into a sepsis group (83 patients) and a non-sepsis group (696 patients) according to whether they developed sepsis, and the prevalence of sepsis was approximately 10.65%. Multivariate logistic regression model indicated that albumin infusion was associated with decreased risk of sepsis in the AP patients [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.13–0.88]. Subgroup analysis showed a negative association between the albumin infusion and sepsis risk in the AP patients with serum albumin ≤ 3.5g/L (adjusted OR=0.29, 95%CI = 0.08–0.77). Conclusion In this study, we found an association between albumin administration and a lower risk of sepsis in AP patients, which persisted after multivariate adjustment. This suggests that albumin infusion may have unique potential benefits for this population. © 2025 Zhou et al.

Feicht L.; Dangel A.; Jansen R.-P.,Expression of transgenic biotin ligases in inducible neuronal murine cell lines by integration into the mHipp11 gene locus,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0315806,"Biotin proximity labeling is a powerful method for identifying proteins associated with a specific organelle, a bait protein, or RNA. It requires the expression of a modified biotin ligase by transient transfection or from a stably integrated expression construct. Because such stable integration of transgenes into stem cells can lead to silencing during differentiation, targeting a biotin ligase to a genomic safe harbor site would be beneficial. Here, we report on the successful targeting and expression of two biotin ligase constructs to the mouse Hipp11 locus during neuronal differentiation. While randomly integrated MicroID and TurboID are expressed and active in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), expression ceases upon differentiation into mESC-derived neurons, which is independent of the promoter used. In contrast, targeting of the same expression cassette to the mHipp11 locus results in expression, correct localization, and biotinylation activity not only in mESCs but also in neurons 8–10 days after differentiation. This demonstrates that the mouse Hipp11 locus is a promising genomic integration site for transgenic biotin ligases in mESCs and mESC-derived neurons. © 2025 Feicht et al.

Iron overload has been recognized in recent years as a new way to exacerbate osteoarthritis. Objective This study evaluated the effects of ATP on iron overload related osteoarthritis. Materials and methods C57BL/6J mice were randomly allocated to five groups as follows (n=10 mice each): (1) sham; (2) destabilized medial meniscus(DMM); (3) DMM+ID; (4) DMM+ID+APT-L (50mg/kg APT gavage daily); (5) DMM+ID+APT-H (100mg/kg APT gavage daily). The chondrocytes treated by FAC (100μM) were used as an in vitro model of iron overload and the effect of APT was observed. Flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, Western blot, qRT-PCR and micro-CT were used to detect the mechanism of action of the APT. Result Our studies showed that APT improved the viability of chondrocytes induced by iron overload. APT can reduce apoptosis of chondrocytes (19.41±2.12% vs. 9.82±1.74%). Furthermore, APT was found significantly attenuated ROS accumulation (2.04±0.31 vs. 1.44±0.15-fold) of chondrocytes through upregulating antioxidant genes NRF2 (1.18±0.13 vs. 1.55±0.17-fold) and HO-1 (1.27±0.15 vs. 1.77±0.20-fold). In vivo experiments revealed that APT attenuated cartilage damage (OARSI score 5.75±1.32 vs. 3.75±0.96) and subchondral bone proliferation in iron overload osteoarthritis mice. Conclusions Our results show that APT can attenuate iron overload-induced cartilage damage in vivo and in vitro via the NRF2/HO-1 pathway. We demonstrated for the first time that APT has promising applications in iron overload diseases. © 2025 Cai et al.

Wu Q.; Liao L.; Deng Q.,Association between red blood cell distribution width-to-albumin ratio at admission and all-cause mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis based on the MIMIC-III database,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0318873,"Objective The association between red blood cell distribution width-to-albumin (RDW/ALB) ratio (RAR) and all-cause mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis has not been fully delineated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of RAR at admission on 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis. Design This investigation was conducted as a retrospective analysis utilizing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Participants Patients with acute pancreatitis were selected from the MIMIC-III database according to predefined eligibility criteria. Outcome The outcome was the all-cause mortality rates within 28 days. Results Upon screening and excluding ineligible participants, a total of 931 patients with acute pancreatitis who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The overall mortality at 28 days was 11.71%. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that RAR had a moderate predictive value for all-cause mortality at 28 days, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.669 (95%CI, 0.617–0.720; p<0.05), and the cutoff value was 4.39. Divide the patients into a high RAR group and a low RAR group based on the cutoff value. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a statistically significant increase in 28-day mortality among patients in the high RAR group compared to those in the low RAR group. Multivariate analysis indicated that potassium levels, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, lactate, partial thromboplastin time, neutrophil and RAR were independently associated with the 28-day mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that an elevated RAR was independently associated with increased mortality at 28 day (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.64–4.52; p < 0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrated that RAR at admission functioned as a significant prognostic indicator for mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis. © 2025 Wu et al.

However, it has also been reported to sensitize mast cells, potentially leading to hyperresponsiveness. This necessitates careful optimization of its use in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. To fully harness quercetin’s therapeutic potential, this study investigated the effects of quercetin on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells responsiveness over varying durations of exposure. We employed comprehensive transcriptome analysis and subsequent functional validation of key signaling pathways. Our findings revealed that quercetin initially reduced cell activity with short-term treatment. However, with prolonged exposure, quercetin transiently enhanced both IgE cross-linkage-mediated and non-IgE-mediated responses. Specifically, prolonged quercetin treatment downregulated IgE-mediated degranulation and FcεRI expression, while potentially sensitizing RBL-2H3 cells to other non-IgE secretagogues through enhanced PKC activity. Given quercetin’s multifaceted effects on intracellular signaling pathways, it is crucial to further investigate its efficacy and potential risk of adverse effects. Future studies should focus on a deeper understanding of these mechanisms to optimize quercetin’s therapeutic applications while mitigating any possible negative outcomes. © 2025 Matsuo et al.

Deng G.; Tang L.; Yang Q.; Li Z.,Association of the abbreviated burn severity index with mortality in severely burned patients: A meta-analysis,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319199,"Background and purpose The ability of the abbreviated burn severity index (ABSI) to predict death among patients with severe burns remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to identify the association between the ABSI and mortality in severely burned patients. Methods The PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched up to September 15, 2024. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were combined, and a subgroup analysis was conducted on the basis of age, ABSI grouping method and OR source. All the statistical analyses were performed with STATA version 15.0. Results Sixteen studies with 4011 cases were included in the analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that an elevated ABSI was significantly related to an increased risk of mortality (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.48–2.00; P < 0.001). In addition, subgroup analysis by age (adult: OR = 1.35, P < 0.001; child: OR = 68.40, P < 0.001), ABSI grouping method (dichotomous: OR = 16.14, P < 0.001; continuous: OR = 1.59, P < 0.001) and OR source (univariate: OR = 11.42, P = 0.015; multivariate: OR = 1.51, P < 0.001) yielded similar results.

Immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation play crucial roles in frailty, and this study aimed to explore the correlation between the intestinal microbiota and frailty. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a comprehensive geriatric assessment of older individuals who underwent medical checkups at the Health Management Center from April 2023 to May 2024. A total of 672 older individuals who met the inclusion criteria were included and divided into a healthy control group and a frail case group. Clinical data, as well as blood and stool samples, were collected. The data from the two groups were analysed with 16S rRNA sequencing in 20 and 30 cases, respectively. SPSS 25.0 was used for statistical analysis. Results There were significant differences in income, smoking, and globulin levels between the two groups, while there were no differences in age or sex. There was no significant difference in the abundance or species evenness of intestinal bacteria between the two groups. However, the abundance of accessory bacteria, bifidobacteria, and Escherichia coli in the frail group was greater than that in the control group. Specifically, Escherichia-Shigella was significantly upregulated and fit well into the prediction model of frailty. Conclusion The gut microbiota of frail older individuals underwent significant changes in structural composition, and the presence of Escherichia-Shigella may be a diagnostic marker for debilitating diseases. These findings provide an essential clinical reference value for developing methods for preventing or alleviating frailty based on specific microbial communities. © 2025 Zhang et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004770095,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

It is essential to identify and prevent the risk factors for postoperative delirium (POD) in these cases. We aimed to determine the risk factors for POD in patients who underwent lower-extremity surgery through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included observational studies identifying risk factors for POD in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Data sources included the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and MEDLINE. We extracted the variables related to delirium that were analyzed by two or more studies meeting the eligibility criteria. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled odds ratio, standardized mean difference, and 95% confidence interval. Data were considered significant when p < 0.05. Twenty-seven studies with a total sample size of 9,044 were evaluated. Our meta-analysis revealed 20 risk factors for patients with POD undergoing orthopedic surgery, including age, cognitive scores, various preoperative laboratory values (such as serum albumin, C-reactive protein, and thyroid hormones), length of hospital stay, surgery and anesthesia duration, blood transfusion, and previous health conditions such as dementia and cardiovascular disease. Gathering preoperative and postoperative data was crucial for identifying high-risk patients for POD. In addition, preventive measures targeting POD risk factors could reduce its occurrence after orthopedic surgery. Copyright: © 2025 Suzuki et al.

Li W.; Li N.; Zhan Y.; Gu J.,Blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio as predictor of mortality among acute pancreatitis patients in ICU: A retrospective cohort study,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0323321,"Objective Blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio (BAR) has served as a predictive marker for patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and has been studied in patients with sepsis, post-cardiac surgery, severe COVID-19, and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). This objective indicator has demonstrated capability in prognostic prediction.However, research on the prognostic value of BAR in acute pancreatitis (AP) patients are scarce,the goal was to explore the relationship between BAR and total mortality in AP admitted to ICU. Methods A Retrospective analysis was performed utilizing the Medical Information Market for Intensive Care (MIMIC IV) database. Patients with AP admitted to ICU were included and grouped based on BAR. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were utilized to explore the relationship between BAR and total mortality. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to assess the predictive value of BAR. Cumulative hazard risk accumulation curve verified BAR’s predictive capability for short- and long-term mortality. Heterogeneity between different subgroups was excluded by subgroup analysis. Results Total 514 AP patients were divided into high-BAR (BAR ≥ 7.62) and low-BAR group (BAR < 7.62). The duration of ICU stay was significantly extended in the high BAR group. In the Cox proportional hazard model, whether adjusting for confounding factors or not, the high BAR was an independent risk factor for total mortality. AUC for BAR was 0.78 (95% C1: 0.72–0.84) at 28 days and 0.70 (95%: Cl: 0.64–0.75) at 360 days. Conclusion BAR is an objective and independent predictor of both short- and long-term total mortality in AP patients.

Zhang L.; Gao X.; He M.; Wang W.; Zhao Y.,Nonlinear association between C-reactive protein and severity of diabetic foot infection in patients with diabetes: A retrospective cohort study with clinical implications,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0323704,"Objective Diabetic foot infection(DFI) is a frequent complication of diabetes and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. These are huge economic health burdens for patients, countries, and the world. Timely diagnosis and accurate assessment of the severity of DFI based on sensitive inflammatory biomarkers is critical, with considerable benefits for debridement procedures and antibiotic use. This study aimed to examine the association between C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the severity of DFI in patients with diabetes. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we investigate the association between CRP levels and the severity of DFI in patients with diabetes. Multivariable logistic regression modeling, a generalized additive model, and a two-piecewise linear regression model were conducted to explore the relationship between CRP levels and DFI severity. Results Based on inclusion exclusion criteria, A total of 301 patients with Wagner stage 3 or higher diabetic foot ulcers combined with moderate to severe infections were included in the study at last. CRP levels were independently associated with the severity of DFIs after accounting for potential confounding factors. A nonlinear relationship was observed between CRP level and DFI severity, with a threshold of approximately 105 mg/L. The odds ratio for severe diabetic foot infection was 1.039 (95% confidence interval: 1.019–1.06, P < 0.001) in patients with DFI and CRP < 105 mg/L. Conclusion The relationship between CRP and the severity of DFI was nonlinear; as CRP levels remained below 105mg/L, the severity of DFI increased with an increase in CRP. © 2025 Zhang et al.

Zhao Z.; Ji H.; Liu W.; Wang Z.; Ren S.; Liu C.; Wu C.; Wang J.; Ding X.,The saturation effect of a body shape index on lumbar bone mineral density in US adults: Findings from a nationwide survey,2025,PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0324160,"Background Many studies have demonstrated that obesity is closely linked with bone metabolism. A body shape index (ABSI) is a newly developed obesity indicator, which provides superior reflection of central obesity compared to body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Nevertheless, investigation of the association between ABSI and bone mineral density (BMD) remains limited. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the correlation between ABSI and lumbar BMD among US adults. Methods We analyzed data of adults aged 20 years and older from 2011–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Weighted multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the linear relationship between ABSI and lumbar BMD. Weighted smooth curve fitting and two-segment linear model were applied to explore the nonlinear association. Subgroup analysis stratified by age, gender, race, and BMI was performed. Results A total of 10991 subjects was enrolled in the study. In the fully adjusted model, the ABSI was negatively related to lumbar BMD (β = −0.007, 95% CI: −0.009, −0.005). The adverse correlation remained significant across all subgroups among stratified analysis. The saturation effect between ABSI and lumbar BMD was identified, with the turning point at the ABSI value of 0.08. Similar nonlinear trends were also observed in participants aged <40 years, males, Non-Hispanic White, BMI < 25 kg/m2, and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. Conclusion This study revealed a prominently negative correlation and saturation effect between ABSI and lumbar BMD in US adults. Our findings may provide valuable inspiration for further prevention and intervention of osteoporosis. © 2025 Zhao et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007206174,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Weighted logistic regression confirmed FIB4 index as a significant independent predictor of CKD risk (fully adjusted odds ratios (OR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64–2.08), with strong dose-response gradient (Q4 OR 3.51–6.02). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models revealed that each 1-unit increase in the FIB4 index was associated with a 34% elevated risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.34, 95%CI: 1.27–1.41, p<0.001) and a 34% increased risk of CVD mortality (HR=1.34, 95% CI: 1.24–1.44, p<0.001). Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis identified nonlinear threshold effects at inflection points of 1.84 (all-cause mortality) and 1.74 (CVD mortality), with mortality risks escalating sharply beyond these thresholds (all-cause HR=2.57; CVD HR=2.85). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated robust predictive performance (area under the curve (AUC): 0.799 for all-cause mortality; 0.801 for CVD mortality). Subgroup analyses highlighted heightened risks among non-Hispanic Black individuals, older adults, and those with low physical activity. Mediation analysis indicated that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) mediated 5.48% of the FIB4–all-cause mortality association and 5.83% of the CVD mortality association, though direct effects predominated (94.52% and 94.17%, respectively). These findings establish the FIB4 index as a practical, evidence-based tool for risk stratification in CKD patients, offering critical insights for personalized clinical management. © 2025 Zhu et al.

Kulkarni K.; Hussain T.,Megalin A Sidekick or Nemesis of the Kidney?,2025,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology,10.1681/ASN.0000000572,"Megalin is an endocytic receptor in the proximal tubules that reabsorbs filtered proteins in the kidneys. Recycling of megalin after endocytosis and its expression on the apical plasma membrane of the proximal tubule are critical for its function. The expression of megalin in the kidney undergoes dynamic changes under physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. Receptors and various effector signaling components regulate megalin expression and, potentially, function. Genetic manipulation and rare mutations in megalin suggest that a lack of or deficiency in megalin expression/function promotes tubular proteinuria and albuminuria. However, the role of megalin in kidney diseases associated with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and nephrotoxicity remains unclear. To address these questions, animal and human studies have indicated megalin as a protective, injurious, and potentially urinary marker of nephropathy. This article reviews the literature on the regulation of megalin expression and the role of megalin in the pathophysiology of the kidney under experimental and clinical conditions. Moreover, this review articulates the need for studies that can clarify whether megalin can serve as a therapeutic target, in one way or the other, to treat kidney disease. © 2024 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210978980,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Recently, a US real-world study found statistically significant improvements in A1c levels among patients using GLP-1 RA and a CGM device, compared with a matched cohort receiving only GLP-1 RA. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness from a US payer perspective of initiating CGM (FreeStyle Libre Systems) in people living with T2DM using a GLP-1 RA therapy, compared with GLP-1 RA alone. METHODS: A patient-level microsimulation model was run for 10,000 patients over a lifetime horizon with 3.0% discounting for costs and utilities. Patient characteristics were based on the overall population of the US real-world study and the subgroup of patients not using intensive insulin. The effect of CGM was modeled as a persistent reduction in A1c compared with GLP-1 RA alone (overall=0.37%; patients not using intensive insulin=0.34%). Costs ($2,023) and disutilities were applied to diabetes complications and acute diabetic events. Outcomes were assessed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (incremental costs/incremental QALYs) for GLP-1 RA plus CGM vs GLP-1 RA alone was $40,968/QALY in the overall cohort (cost=$484,180 vs $473,938; QALYs=13.37 vs 13.12). Among patients not using intensive insulin, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $43,095/QALY. Scenario analysis showed that the model results were robust to changing assumptions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that GLP-1 RA plus CGM had a 64% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: From a US payer perspective, CGM is cost-effective when added to GLP-1 RA therapies for the treatment of T2DM, including for patients not using intensive insulin.

However, little is known about trends in the use of first-line glucose-lowering therapies over time. OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in the use of first-line glucose-lowering therapies from 2019 to 2023 among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and changes over time in the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients initiating these therapies. METHODS: This retrospective study identified patients aged 18 years and older from the Komodo Healthcare Map database who filled any glucose-lowering medication between January 2019 and May 2023. The prevalence of first-line glucose-lowering therapy use among patients with T2D was calculated in each month. Pearson χ2 and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests were used to compare patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics such as cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease by type of first-line glucose-lowering medication. RESULTS: The study cohort of 964,914 patients was predominantly made up of female patients (68%) and had a mean age of 54 (SD=13). The majority of patients initiated metformin before 2022 (74%-83%), followed by insulin (6%-11%), sulfonylureas (3%-7%), glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) (2%-5%), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2is) (1%-4%), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (1%-3%). From January 2022 to May 2023, first-line use of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is increased from 6% and 4% to 18% and 7%, respectively. In contrast, first-line use of metformin, sulfonylureas, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors declined from 76%, 4%, and 2% to 64%, 2%, and 1% over the same period, respectively. Relative to 2019-2021, first-line GLP-1RA users in 2022-2023 were likely to be younger, female, and covered by Medicaid and to have fewer comorbidities as determined by the Charlson Comorbidity Index. In contrast, first-line SGLT2i users were more likely to be older and to have more comorbidities over the same period. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a significant shift in the use of first-line glucose-lowering therapies from metformin to GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is. The proportion of first-line GLP-1RA and SGLT2i users with cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease has increased significantly over time, aligning with guidelines from the American Diabetes Association. Further studies are merited to evaluate the cost-benefit implications of this shift in first-line glucose-lowering use. © 2025, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures establish quality benchmarks for comprehensive diabetes care and guide reimbursement. Large-scale research on the effect of pharmacist interventions to improve these quality measures in primary care remains limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a pharmacist-physician collaborative care (PPCC) model on comprehensive diabetes care quality measure achievement compared with standard care (SC). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adults aged 18 to 75 years with uncontrolled T2DM receiving care in primary care clinics at a community-based health system in Virginia from July 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019. Patients were in one of 2 groups: (1) the intervention group (PPCC), where embedded pharmacists provided diabetes management under a collaborative practice agreement, and (2) the comparator group receiving SC in clinics without pharmacists. The SC group was created via 1:2 propensity score matching. Generalized linear mixed models assessed the association between group and quality measure achievement. Primary outcomes included glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c) (≤9%, ≤8%, ≤7%) and blood pressure control (<140/90 mm Hg), per the last recorded value in 2019. RESULTS: The sample (N=1,293) had a mean age of 57 years, was 56% female, and 45% each White and Black. The PPCC group (n=431) was more likely to achieve A1c control compared with the SC group (n=862) (A1c <9%: odds ratio [OR]=3.68, 95% CI=2.31-5.84; A1c <8%: OR=3.53, 95% CI=2.12-5.89; A1c <7%: OR=4.61, 95% CI=2.48-8.56; all P<0.01). Similarly, the PPCC group was more likely to achieve blood pressure control less than 140/90 mm Hg (OR=1.49, 95% CI=1.01-2.22; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the PPCC group were more likely to meet comprehensive diabetes care quality measures compared with SC. These results underscore the value of pharmacists in diabetes management in primary care and their contribution to value-based care. Copyright © 2025, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

Traditional socket prostheses remain the rehabilitation standard, although transcutaneous osseointegration for amputees (TOFA) is proving a viable alternative. Limited studies of TOFA for vascular amputees have been published, but no study has focused on TOFA for patients with DM, neglecting this important patient population. The primary aim of the present study exploring this potential care option was to report the frequencies and types of adverse events following TOFA for patients with well-controlled DM. The secondary aims were to report their mobility and quality-of-life changes. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of 17 consecutive patients with well-controlled DM who had undergone unilateral transfemoral TOFA from 2013 to 2019 and had been followed for at least 2 years. Outcomes were perioperative complications, additional surgery (soft-tissue refashioning, debridement, implant removal, periprosthetic fracture treatment), mobility (daily prosthesis wear hours, K-level, Timed Up and Go Test, 6-Minute Walk Test), and patient-reported outcomes (Questionnaire for Persons with a Transfemoral Amputation, Short Form-36). Results: There were no perioperative systemic complications, deaths, or proximal amputations. Two patients (12%) sustained a periprosthetic fracture following a fall, managed by internal fixation with implant retention, and regained independent ambulation. Eight patients (47%) had additional surgery or surgeries for non-traumatic complications: 4 (24%) had soft-tissue refashioning, 3 (18%) had debridement, and 3 others had implant removal with subsequent revision osseointegration for aseptic loosening (1) or infection (2). The proportion of patients wearing their prosthesis at least 8 hours daily improved from 5 (36%) to 11 (79%) of 14 (p = 0.054). The proportion of patients who achieved at least K-level 2 improved from 6% to 94% (p < 0.001). Other changes were not significant. Conclusions: Contraindicating TOFA for all patients with DM seems draconian. Patients with well-controlled DM experienced significant mobility improvements, although additional surgery was somewhat common. Improvements in selection criteria or surgical technique to reduce risks are needed so that TOFA can be routinely considered for amputees with well-controlled DM.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D (VitD) supplementation on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in CHF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Methods: A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in HFrEF patients. Patients were randomized to receive two doses of 200,000 IU VitD3 (VitD group) or saline solution (placebo group) at a two-week interval. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and renin concentrations were assessed at baseline and one month after the first dose. The primary outcome was plasma renin change. The study was registered at the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry as PACTR201908774181973. Results: Forty patients in each group completed the trial. At baseline, hypovitaminosis D and hyperreninemia were found in 85% and 77.5% of patients, respectively, with no differences between VitD and placebo groups. VitD supplementation resulted in an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the VitD group, only. In parallel, plasma renin decreased in the VitD group [renin change: median (25th percentile; 75th percentile), -34.9 (-110; -7.1)], but did not change in the placebo group [1.35 (-1.2; 8.8)]. No significant changes were found for clinical, echocardiographic, and other biochemical parameters in both groups. Conclusions: A mega-dose of vitamin D resulted in middle-term RAAS suppression but didn’t affect cardiac function and clinical features in HFrEF patients. Further research with longer follow-ups is needed to evaluate whether persistent adequate VitD status results in long-term RAAS suppression and cardiac function improvement. © 2025 HBKU Press.

Little is known, however, about the immediate regulation of islet hormonal output by nicotine, an agonist of ionotropic cholinergic receptors. We investigated this by imaging cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics in mouse and human islets using confocal microscopy and measuring glucagon secretion in response to the alkaloid from isolated mouse islets. Nicotine acutely stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ in glucagonsecreting α-cells but not in insulin-secreting β-cells. The 2.8-± 0.5-fold (P < 0.05) increase in Ca2+, observed in >70% of α-cells, correlated well with a 2.5-± 0.3-fold stimulation of glucagon secretion. Nicotine-induced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ relied on influx from the extracellular compartment rather than release of the cation from intracellular depots. Metabotropic cholinergic signaling, monitored at the level of intracellular diacylglycerol, was limited to 69% of α-cells versus 94% of β-cells. We conclude that parasympathetic regulation of pancreatic islet hormone release uses different signaling pathways in β-cells (metabotropic) and α-cells (metabotropic and ionotropic), resulting in the fine-tuning of acetylcholine-induced glucagon exocytosis.

Little is known, however, about the immediate regulation of islet hormonal output by nicotine, an agonist of ionotropic cholinergic receptors. We investigated this by imaging cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics in mouse and human islets using confocal microscopy and measuring glucagon secretion in response to the alkaloid from isolated mouse islets. Nicotine acutely stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ in glucagonsecreting α-cells but not in insulin-secreting β-cells. The 2.8-± 0.5-fold (P < 0.05) increase in Ca2+, observed in >70% of α-cells, correlated well with a 2.5-± 0.3-fold stimulation of glucagon secretion. Nicotine-induced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ relied on influx from the extracellular compartment rather than release of the cation from intracellular depots. Metabotropic cholinergic signaling, monitored at the level of intracellular diacylglycerol, was limited to 69% of α-cells versus 94% of β-cells. We conclude that parasympathetic regulation of pancreatic islet hormone release uses different signaling pathways in β-cells (metabotropic) and α-cells (metabotropic and ionotropic), resulting in the fine-tuning of acetylcholine-induced glucagon exocytosis.

Until recently, life-long insulin injection was the only approved treatment for T1D, but it does not address the underlying disease pathology. The aimfor antigen-specific immunotherapy (ASI) is to restore tolerance. ASI holds potential as a new therapeutic strategy for treating autoimmune diseases with well-characterized antigens. Peptide ASI using processing-independent CD4+ T-cell epitopes (PIPs) shows promising results in several autoimmune diseases. Here, we successfully applied the principles of PIP design to the T1D autoantigen glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65). Peptides spanning GAD65 predicted to be pan–HLA-DR binding were selected. Peptide 10 (P10) displayed enriched responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people with T1D. The minimal epitope of the P10 peptide was fine mapped using T-cell hybridomas generated from HLA-DRB1*04:01 transgenic mice. This minimal epitope, P10Sol, was demonstrated, using a novel activation-induced marker assay, to induce tolerance to the parent peptide in the transgenicmice. Finally, we show that GAD65 P10Sol PIP is recognized by CD4+ T cells from people with T1D who possess a range of HLA-DR alleles and, therefore, can be defined as a pan–DR-binding peptidewith therapeutic potential. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219494127,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Here, we evaluated whether weight loss-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity were associated with changes in muscle sn-1,2-DAG and ceramide content in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes. We measured skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in conjunc-tion with stable isotopically labeled glucose tracer infusion, and skeletal muscle sn-1,2-DAG and ceramide contents by using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry after subcellular fractionation and DAG isomer separation in 14 adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes before and after marked (18.6 ± 2.1%) weight loss. Whole-body insulin sensitivity doubled after weight loss. Sarcolemmal sn-1,2-DAG and C18:0 ceramide contents after weight loss were not different from values before weight loss. In contrast, mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) C18:0 ceramide content decreased by ~20% after weight loss (from 2.16 ± 0.08 to 1.71 ± 0.13 nmol/g, P < 0.005). These results suggest a decrease in muscle mitochondrial-ER C18:0 ceramide content could contribute to the beneficial effect of weight loss on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210453545,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We hypothesized that stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by GLP-1R agonists, thus inducing cortisol secretion, could explain this unresponsiveness to GLP-1R agonists. To assess the effects of GLP-1R agonist treatment on the HPA axis, we selected 10 individuals with type 2 diabetes with (n = 5 women and 5 men) and nine without (n =4 and 5) an adequate response to GLP-1R agonists and used [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 positron emission tomography/computed tomography to quantify GLP-1R expression in the pituitary. Oral glucose tolerance and 24-h urinary cortisol excretion were measured in all participants. Pituitary tracer uptake was observed in all par-ticipants, with no significant difference between responders and nonresponders. Pituitary tracer uptake correlated with the area under the curve for ACTH, urinary cortisol-to-creatinine ratio, and age. Interestingly, men had higher pituitary tracer uptake than women. In conclusion, this study does not indicate a role for pituitary GLP-1R expression or HPA axis stimulation in the difference in treatment response to GLP-1R agonists among individuals with type 2 diabetes. The findings of substantial pituitary GLP-1R expression and the significant sex differences require further research. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216606701,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Our studies indicate that CD4 T cells reactive to hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) play a critical role in T-cell–mediated b-cell destruction. We have shown that HIPs form in human islets between fragments of the C-peptide and cleavage products of secretory granule proteins. To identify T-cell specificities contributing to T1D pathogenesis, we tested T-cell reactivity from T1D patients or healthy control individuals using an IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay against a library of 240 C-peptide HIPs. We observed elevated T-cell responses to peptide pools containing HIPs that form at the amino acid residues G15, A18, and L26 of C-peptide. In a second cohort of healthy control individuals, at-risk individuals, and T1D patients, T-cell reactivity to HIPs forming at these three residues was monitored. Results indicate that, prior to clinical onset of T1D, there were significantly elevated responses to multiple pools of HIPs, and the magnitude of T-cell reactivity to HIPs forming at residue A18 of the C-peptide was increased. Overall, our study identifies new T-cell specificities in at-risk individuals and indicates that T-cell reactivity to HIPs can be observed before T1D onset. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006539210,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We investi-gated the characteristics of insulin sensitivity and b-cell function behind this observation. After age, sex, and BMI matching, 496 study participants selected from 3,965 individuals without diabetes who were at high risk of type 2 diabetes in a tertiary medical center were categorized into four groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio based on OGTT results: 1) 1-h PG level <8.6 mmol/L and 2-h PG level <7.8 mmol/L (normal glucose tolerance [NGT]/1h-normal); 2) 1-h PG level $8.6 mmol/L and 2-h level <7.8 mmol/L (NGT/1h-high); 3) 1-h PG level <8.6 mmol/L and 2-h level $7.8 mmol/L (im-paired glucose tolerance [IGT]/1h-normal); and 4) 1 h PG level $8.6 mmol/L and 2-h level $7.8 mmol/L. Compared with participants with IGT/1h-normal, those with NGT/1h-high had a similar extent of insulin resistance but lower early-phase insulin secretion. Additionally, participants with NGT/1h-high had a lower disposition index at both 0–30 min and 0–120 min than those with IGT/1h-normal. The fitted re-gression line relating PG to log-transformed disposition index (0–30 min and 0–120 min) was significantly steeper for 1-h than 2-h PG. In conclusion, 1-h PG seemed to be more sensitive to the deterioration in b-cell function than was 2-h PG.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial we assessed the effects of adjunctive SGLT2 inhibitor therapy (dapagliflozin 10 mg daily) alone and in combination with the GRA volagidemab (70 mg weekly) in 12 adults with type 1 diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring, insulin dosing, and insulin withdrawal tests (IWT) for measurement of glucose and ketogenesis during insulinopenia were completed during insulin-only (Baseline), SGLT2 inhibitor, and combination (SGLT2 inhibitor RESULTS Average glucose and percent time with glucose in range (70–180 mg/dL) improved with combination therapy versus Baseline and SGLT2 inhibitor (131 vs. 150 and 138 mg/dL [P < 0.001 and P = 0.01] and 86% vs. 70% and 78% [P < 0.001 and P = 0.03], respectively) without increased hypoglycemia. Total daily insulin use decreased with combination therapy versus Baseline and SGLT2 inhibitor (0.41 vs. 0.56 and 0.52 units/kg/day [P < 0.001 and P =0.002]).Peak b-hydroxybutyrate levels during IWT were lower with combination therapy than with SGLT2 inhibitor (2.0 vs. 2.4 mmol/L; P = 0.048) and similar to levels reached during the Baseline testing period (2.1 mmol/L). Participants reported enhanced treatment acceptability and satisfaction with combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS Glucagon antagonism enhances the therapeutic effects of SGLT2 inhibition in type 1 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This study compared responses from GPT-4 to responses from 31 endocrinolo-gists outcome was the choice between metformin and other treatments. RESULTS With a simple prompt, GPT-4 chose metformin in 12% (95% CI 7.9–17%) of responses, compared with 31% (95% CI 23–39%) of endocrinologist responses. After modifying the prompt to encourage metformin use, the selection of metformin by GPT-4 increased to 25% (95% CI 22–28%). GPT-4 rarely selected metformin in patients with impaired kidney function, or a history of gastrointestinal distress (2.9% of responses, 95% CI 1.4–5.5%). In contrast, endocrinologists often prescribed metformin even in patients with a history of gastrointestinal distress (21% of responses, 95% CI 12–36%). GPT-4 responses showed low variability on repeated runs except at intermediate levels of kidney function. CONCLUSIONS In clinical scenarios with no single right answer, GPT-4’s responses were reasonable, but differed from endocrinologists’ responses in clinically important ways. Value judgments are needed to determine when these differences should be addressed by adjusting the model. We recommend against reliance on LLM output until it is shown to align not just with clinical guidelines but also with patient and clinician preferen-ces, or it demonstrates improvement in clinical outcomes over standard of care. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216544887,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to identify genetic drivers of T1D in the absence of DR3/DR4 and improve prediction of T1D risk in these individuals. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We performed T1D association and fine-mapping analyses in 12,316 non-DR3/DR4 samples. Next, we performed heterogeneity tests to examine differences in T1D risk variants in individuals without versus those with DR3/DR4 haplotypes. We further assessed genome-wide differences in gene regulatory element and biological path-way enrichments between the non-DR3/DR4 and DR3/DR4 cohorts. Finally, we de-veloped and compared with an existing T1D GRS. RESULTS A total of 18 T1D risk variants in non-DR3/DR4 samples were identified. Risk variants at the MHC and multiple other loci genome wide had heterogeneity in effects on T1D dependent on DR3/DR4 status, and non-DR3/DR4 T1D had evidence for a greater polygenic burden. T1D-associated variants in non-DR3/DR4 were more enriched for regulatory elements and pathways involved in antigen presen-tation, innate immunity, and β-cells and depleted in T cells compared with DR3/DR4. A non-DR3/DR4 GRS outperformed an existing risk score GRS2 in dis-criminating non-DR3/DR4 T1D from no diabetes (area under the curve 0.867; P = 7.48 × 10-32) and type 2 diabetes (0.907; P = 4.94 × 10-44).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Using the 2010–2021 Korea National Health Insurance Service database, we con-ducted a population-based cohort study, comparing initiators of SGLT2is versus DPP4is. The primary outcome was incident nephrolithiasis. Osteoarthritis encounters served as a negative control outcome. After 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching in stone never-and ever-formers, pooled and individual hazard ratios (HRs), incidence rate difference (IRD), and 95% CIs were reported. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, thiazide co-use, and baseline cardiovascular risk were done. RESULTS The 17,006 PS-matched pairs of SGLT2i and DPP4i initiators were pooled from stone never-formers (105,378 pairs) and ever-formers (11,628 pairs). Over a mean of 654 days, the risk of nephrolithiasis was lower in SGLT2i initiators than in DPP4i initiators: 0.65 vs. 1.12 events per 100 person-years, HR 0.54 (95% CI, 0.50–0.57), IRD-0.46 (95% CI,-0.21 to-0.52).

Research Design and Methods: We analyzed 142,884 adults aged 18–79 years with self-reported diabetes type from the cross-sectional National Health Interview Survey in 2016–2022, representing the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. Incidence of diagnosed T2D was calculated for three age groups: young-adult onset (18–44 years), middle-age onset (45–64 years), and older-adult onset (65–79 years); the latter two groups were included to highlight the distinct risk factor profile of young-adult-onset T2D.Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify risk factors for young-adult-onset T2D. Results: The estimated incidence of diagnosed young-adult-onset T2D was 3.0 per 1,000 adults (95% CI 2.6–3.5). Minority groups, socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, and people with cardiometabolic diseases or psychological conditions had a higher incidence of diagnosed young-adult-onset T2D compared with their counterparts. Lipid-lowering medication use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 13.15, 95% CI 8.85–19.55), antihypertensive medication use (aOR 11.89, 95% CI 7.97–17.73), and obesity (BMI $30 vs. &lt;25 kg/m2, aOR 10.89, 95% CI 6.69–17.7) were the strongest risk factors for young-adult-onset T2D; these risk factors, along with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary heart disease, were more strongly associated with young-adult-onset T2D compared with later-onset T2D, with up to 4.5 times higher aORs. Conclusions: This study quantified the incidence of diagnosed young-adult-onset T2D in U.S. adults and identified its distinct risk factor profile.

RESULTS For the 110 participants included in the primary analysis, mean ± SD age was 61 ± 12 years and mean HbA1c was 8.9 ± 2.3% (73.8 ± 1.6 mmol/mol). During the study, CGM-measured mean glucose was 170 mg/dL for the intensive group (n = 60) vs. 175 mg/dL for the standard group (n = 50; risk-adjusted difference 27 mg/dL, 95% CI 219 to 5; P = 0.25). Only 7% of the intensive group achieved the mean glucose target range of 90–130 mg/dL. CGM readings <54 mg/dL were infrequent (0.2% for intensive and 0.4% for standard; adjusted treatment group difference 20.1%, 95% CI 20.6 to 0.3). One severe hypoglycemia event occurred in the standard group. CONCLUSIONS The study’s glucose management approach using CGM did not improve glucose levels compared with standard glucose management in the non–intensive care unit hospital setting. A glucose target of 90–130 mg/dL may not be realistic in the current environment of insulin management in the hospital. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213597308,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

AGEs represent a potential target to prevent or treat diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN). The current study aimed to characterize cutaneous carbonyl stress, oxidative stress, immune cells, and endothelial cell damage in early type 2 diabetes compared with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) using novel cutaneous biomarkers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Included were 160 individuals recently (≤12 months) diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 144 with NGT from the German Diabetes Study baseline cohort. Nerve function was assessed using electrophysiological, quantitative sensory, and clinical testing. Skin biopsies were obtained to analyze intraepidermal nerve fiber density, AGE autofluorescence, argpyrimidine area, and endothelial cell area. In addition, skin autofluorescence was measured noninvasively using the AGE reader. A subgroup with type 2 diabetes (n = 80) was reassessed 5 years later. RESULTS After adjustment for sex, age, HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, and BMI, argpyrimidine area (17.5 ± 18.8 vs. 11.7 ± 12.7%) was higher in recent-onset type 2 diabetes than in NGT (P < 0.05). AGE autofluorescence was inversely correlated with nerve conduction (e.g., peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity: r = 20.346) and pos-itively with AGE reader measurements in type 2 diabetes (r = 0.358, all P < 0.05), but not in NGT. Higher baseline AGE autofluorescence and lower endothelial cell area predicted the deterioration of clinical and neurophysiological measures after 5 years. CONCLUSIONS Cutaneous AGE markers were associated with neurophysiological deficits in re-cent-onset type 2 diabetes and predicted their progression after 5 years, substan-tiating the role of carbonyl stress in the development of early DSPN. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216715184,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS With an active comparator, new-user approach, we conducted a cohort study using the U.K. Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked with hospital and national statistics databases. Cox proportional hazards models using propensity score fine stratification weighting were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for cirrhosis (primary outcome) and decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-relatedmortality (secondary outcomes). RESULTS In the first cohort comparing 25,516 patients starting GLP-1RAs and 186,752 starting DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1RAs were not associated with the incidence of cirrhosis (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68–1.19) or the secondary outcomes. In a separate cohort comparing 33,161 patients starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and 124,431 starting DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced incidence of cirrhosis (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46–0.90), as also decompensated cirrhosis (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54–1.00), but not with a lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma or liver-relatedmortality. CONCLUSIONS In patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.K., GLP-1RAs were not associated with a lower risk of cirrhosis compared with DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a lower risk of cirrhosis compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219499180,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We investigated whether metformin could prevent GC-related toxicity and explored the underlying mechanisms. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial compared metformin with placebo during high-dose GC treatment in 18 lean, healthy, male study participants. The trial was conducted at the University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. Participants received prednisone 30 mg/day in combination with metformin or placebo for two 7-day periods (1:1 randomization). The primary out-come, change in insulin sensitivity, was assessed using a two-sided paired t test. Before and after each study period, we conducted a mixed-meal tolerance test, blood metabolomics, and RNA sequencing of subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy specimens. RESULTS Metformin improved insulin sensitivity as assessed by the Matsuda index (n = 17; mean change 22.73 ± 3.55 SD for placebo, 2.21 ± 3.95 for metformin; mean difference of change 24.94 [95% CI, 27.24, 22.65]; P < 0.001). Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that metformin altered fatty acid flux in the blood and downregulated genes involved in fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue. Metformin reduced markers of protein breakdown and bone resorption. Further-more, metformin downregulated genes responsible for AMPK inhibition and affected glucagon-like peptide 1 and bile acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS Metformin prevents GC-induced insulin resistance and reduces markers of dyslipidemia, myopathy, and, possibly, bone resorption through AMPK-dependent and-independent pathways. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004902879,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Few studies have rigorously evaluated the im-pact of the program on patient outcomes using randomized designs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Implementation of an ECHO Diabetes program was evaluated using a stepped-wedge design with recruitment of 20 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) across Cali-fornia and Florida with randomized, phased-in intervention entry. Participating FQHCs (referred to as “spokes”) provided aggregate data, including the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and diabetes technology use. Patients were recruited from spokes, and data collection involved historical and prospective HbA1c measures, HEDIS markers, and pre/post surveys. Linear mixed models were used to generate patient-level monthly HbA1c estimates and evaluate change over time; Pois-son regression was used to model clinic-level technology use. RESULTS The spoke-level cohort included 32,796 people with type 1 diabetes (T1D; 3.4%) and type 2 diabetes (T2D; 96.6%), of whom 72.7% were publicly insured or uninsured. The patient-level cohort included 582 adults with diabetes (33.0% with T1D, 67.0% with T2D). Their mean age was 51.1 years, 80.7% were publicly insured or uninsured, 43.7% were non-Hispanic White, 31.6% were Hispanic, 7.9% were non-Hispanic Black, and 16.8% were in other race/ethnicity categories. At the spoke level, there were statistically significant reductions before and after the intervention in the proportion of people with HbA1c >9% (range 31.7% to 26.7%; P = 0.033). At the patient level, there were statistically significant increases in those using continuous glucose monitoring (range 25.1% to 36.8%; P < 0.0001) and pump use (range 15.3% to 18.3%; P < 0.001) before and after the intervention.

Acknowledging the importance of identifying this population and providing personalized care, the Health Resources and Services Administration mandated institutions to document sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data. To understand the current state of SOGI documentation in the T1D Exchange Quality Improvement Collaborative, a survey assessing LGBTQ1 supportive and inclusive care practices was given to affiliated sites. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS | Thirty-three pediatric and 21 adult care centers were surveyed via Qualtrics. The survey included questions about their electronic health record documentation of patient-identified gender, pronouns, sexual orientation, and sex assigned at birth (SAAB). Care centers also reported on the legality of gender-affirming care in their municipalities, as well as their willingness to change SAAB after patients meet requirements. Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate response frequencies. RESULTS | All 33 of the pediatric centers and 81% (17 of 21) of the adult centers responded to the survey. Sixty-four percent of pediatric centers had established strategies to support SOGI documentation, whereas only 50% of adult centers had implemented strategies. Some adult centers could not confirm whether they documented SOGI. Differences were seen between the pediatric and adult endocrinology centers in their documentation of gender identity (P = 0.04) and pronouns (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION | Although most endocrinology centers documented gender identity and pronouns, fewer documented sexual with diabetes. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007070138,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Trzebiatowski L.; Georgiev P.; Büttner K.; Wehrend A.,Influence of different processing methods on anti-trypsin activity in bovine colostrum,2025,JDS Communications,10.3168/jdsc.2024-0678,"Colostrum is important for supplying the bovine neonate with nutrients, bioactive substances, and immunoglobulins to acquire passive immunity. Trypsin inhibitory activity represents a general characteristic of the first bovine colostrum. It is assumed that the anti-trypsin activity serves to protect bioactive molecules in the colostrum from being digested by the calf. The objectives of the study were to establish a test to determine anti-trypsin activity and test the hypothesis that freezing, acidification, and heat treatment alter anti-trypsin activity compared with untreated bovine colostrum. A photometric assay was established to determine anti-trypsin activity. The activity was expressed in milligrams of inhibited trypsin per milliliter of colostrum. Anti-trypsin activity was measured in untreated colostrum, frozen colostrum (−20°C for 24 h), colostrum acidified using 10% formic acid in a way that it was present as 1% in the sample, and colostrum heat treated according to 2 different protocols (60°C for 60 min and 63.5°C for 30 min). In our study, trypsin inhibition in 40 untreated colostrum samples (0.80 mg/mL, SEM 0.03) corresponded to that observed in frozen colostrum samples (0.79 mg/mL, SEM 0.03). In these first analyzed 40 and 59 extra samples (in total 99 samples), the anti-trypsin activity of frozen colostrum (0.85 mg/mL, SEM 0.01) was compared with colostrum subjected to acidification (0.84 mg/mL, SEM 0.01), heat treatment at 60°C for 60 min (0.65 mg/mL, SEM 0.02), and heat treatment at 63.5°C for 30 min (0.61 mg/mL, SEM 0.02). Acidification did not significantly affect trypsin inhibition. Both heat treatment protocols significantly reduced anti-trypsin activity. In the future, when investigating the effects of postharvest storage and processing on bovine colostrum, the influence on anti-trypsin activity should be evaluated in addition to the effects on immunoglobulins and other components. © 2025",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003920165,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, its relationship with gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Multiple online bioinformatic tools were used to evaluate the messenger (m)RNA expression levels of SH3BGRL3 in GC using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry were performed to assess SH3BGRL3 expression in relation to clinicopathological parameters and outcomes in patients with GC. Significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of SH3BGRL3 were enriched and visualized. Furthermore, associations between the expression of SH3BGRL3 and the infiltration of immune cells were explored. SH3BGRL3 exhibited aberrant expression in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues at the mRNA and protein expression levels, especially in Epstein-Barr virus-negative GC (EBVnGC). Higher SH3BGRL3 expression was significantly associated with increasing tumor-node-metastasis staging, tumor budding, perineural invasion, EGFR expression, and a notably higher preoperative blood glucose concentration in clinical specimens. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher SH3BGRL3 expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor for the overall survival of patients with EBVnGC (hazard ratio, 1.666; P=0.018). Furthermore, the stratified analysis revealed that the SH3BGRL3 phenotype could help to refine prognosis in patients. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.740 when combining SH3BGRL3 with other clinicopathological parameters, which indicated a good model for clinical follow-up decisions. Gene functional enrichment analysis also revealed that the DEGs of SH3BGRL3 were mainly enriched in regulating ATP metabolism, ATP synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain in GC. Moreover, a higher SH3BGRL3 expression was significantly positively correlated with the infiltrating macrophages in GC. In conclusion, SH3BGRL3 is upregulated in GC, particularly in EBVnGC. Higher SH3BGRL3 expression is closely associated with hyperglycemia and poor outcomes in patients with EBVnGC, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and prognostic predictor.  © 2024 Li et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209723771,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Liver dysfunction is a key determinant of the pathogenesis and resolution of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which affects the prognosis of patients. Aims: To evaluate the association of PALBI grade with the risk of 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between PALBI grade and the 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS; results were described as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This association was further assessed by subgroup analyses stratified based on age, sex, and complications. Results: A total of 2,841 patients with ARDS were included, of whom, 703 (24.74%) died within 30 days. After adjusting all covariates, a higher PALBI grade was associated with higher odds of 30-day mortality (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.05-2.29). High PALBI grade was related to higher odds of 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS aged ≥ 65 years (HR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.06-5.01), males (HR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.29-3.44), without sepsis (HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.11-2.64), without pneumonia (HR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.19-2.91), and without any history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.28-2.91). Conclusion: The PALBI grade was positively associated with 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS. The present study provides a reference for risk stratification management of patients with ARDS to improve short-term prognosis. © Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214756236,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We sought to understand 1) the interests and preferences of racial and ethnic minority men, with or at risk for type 2 diabetes, in programs designed to improve health and 2) factors that influence participation and health practices. Methods We designed a 43-question web-based survey on facilitators and barriers to participation in a healthy living program. The survey was administered from August 27, 2019, through September 3, 2019. Our analytic sample consisted of 1,506 men at risk for or diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in racial and ethnic minority groups. We conducted descriptive and regression analyses of survey data. Results Most men (59%) were interested in participating in a healthy living program and/or program elements such as incentives (67%), male-specific health topics (57%), and the inclusion of family (63%). Flexibility was important, since “exercising when it is convenient for me” was the most frequently selected facilitator of physical activity and “the hours were inconvenient” was identified as a challenge in previous programs. Men in this survey were significantly more likely to be interested in participating in a health improvement program for several reasons, including if they were physically active 150 minutes or more per week (vs not) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6–3.0) and had previously been in a healthy living program (vs not) (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.1). Conclusion Our findings can be useful for recruiting and retaining racial and ethnic minority men with or at risk for type 2 diabetes in programs designed to improve health and ultimately reduce disparities in the prevalence of diabetes. © (2025), (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)).

However, there is currently a lack of evidence regarding the impact of these criteria on PIM use among older Chinese adults. Methods We used interrupted time series analysis on the prescription data of older outpatients from 59 hospitals in six major geographic regions of China to compare changes in the overall prevalence of PIM use, the prevalence of PIM use stratified by different numbers of PIMs, and the prevalence of top five PIMs (i.e. clopidogrel, estazolam, zolpidem, sliding-scale insulin, and alprazolam) from 2015 (before) to 2021 (after) the release of criteria in 2018. Results We included 982605 older outpatients. Compared with trends prior to the publication of the criteria, there were significant decreases in the coefficient for change in the slope of the overall prevalence of PIM use (β = −0.607; 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.881, −0.482; P < 0.001), the prevalence of single PIM use (β = −0.368; 95% CI = −0.465, −0.272; P < 0.001), the prevalence of multiple PIM use (β = −0.104; 95% CI = −0.173, −0.080; P = 0.019), the prevalence of clopidogrel (β = −0.342; 95% CI = −0.463, −0.227; P = 0.006), and the prevalence of estazolam (β = −0.077; 95% CI = −0.124, −0.037; P = 0.009) post-publication. Conversely, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of zolpidem, after the criteria were released (β = 0.030; 95% CI = 0.002, 0.057; P = 0.036). Conclusions We found that the release of criteria for effectively identifying and managing PIM use has had a positive effect on its prevalence among older outpatients in China. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218290572,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index is a marker of IR and is associated with the prognosis of patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the TyG index and the risk of death in patients on MHD. Methods: In a retrospective cohort analysis of 368 patients with MHD over an 11-year period from July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2023, the TyG index and other baseline characteristics were measured at the beginning of MHD treatment. A regression model was used to evaluate the correlation between the TyG index and all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality in patients on MHD. Results: The TyG index was associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in MHD patients (P = 0.002 & P = 0.015). After adjusting for various confounding factors, the TyG index remained an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in MHD patients (P < 0.001 & P = 0.044). Compared with MHD patients with low TyG index levels, the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in MHD patients with high TyG index levels increased by 1.790 and 1.735 times, respectively (P = 0.006 & P = 0.022). The predictive time-AUC values of the TyG index for all-cause and cardiovascular death in MHD patients were between 0.698 to 0.819. Conclusion: The baseline TyG index may be an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in MHD patients.
