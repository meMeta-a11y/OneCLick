Objective: To investigate whether partial cardiac denervation, achieved by cutting off the ligament of Marshall (LOM) and resecting the fat pad along the Waterston groove, can reduce the risk of POAF following CABG. Design, Setting and Participants: This single-center, randomized clinical trial enrolled adult patients scheduled for isolated CABG in China. Enrollment was from August 15, 2022, to December 13, 2023; follow-up visits were 30 days after discharge. Interventions: Participants were randomized into the intervention group (CABG plus partial cardiac denervation) and the control group (CABG only) in a 1:1 pattern. All participants were continuously monitored for the incidence of POAF until day 6 after the operation. Main outcome and Measures: The primary end point was the incidence of POAF in 6 days, defined as a supraventricular arrhythmia lasting for more than 30 seconds. Results: The trial enrolled 430 patients (79 [18.4%] female; mean [SD] age, 61.9 [7.8] years). Compared with the control group, the 6-day incidence of POAF was significantly lower in the intervention group (18.1% vs 31.6%; P =.001; risk ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.41-0.81]). To further support these results, a sensitivity analysis performed with Kaplan-Meier survival curves also showed a significant reduction in the occurrence of POAF in the intervention group (hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.36-0.79]; P =.002). Safety assessments showed no difference between the 2 groups, while postoperative medical cost was reduced in the intervention group. Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found that partial cardiac denervation was an effective procedure to reduce the occurrence of POAF after isolated CABG without additional postoperative complications. These results suggest that partial cardiac denervation may be a good option for cardiac surgeons to consider for preventing POAF after CABG.

Kahlon M.K.; Aksan N.S.; Aubrey R.; Clark N.; Cowley-Morillo M.; Dubois C.; Garcia C.; Guerra J.; Pereira D.; Sither M.; Tomlinson S.; Valenzuela S.; Valdez M.R.,Glycemic Control with Layperson-Delivered Telephone Calls vs Usual Care for Patients with Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial,2024,JAMA Network Open,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.48809,"Importance: Diabetes is associated with emotional distress and poor mental health, especially for individuals with low income, hindering patients' ability to manage their condition. The health care system's workforce constraints limit its capacity to holistically support patients. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of layperson-delivered empathetic engagement over the telephone in helping improve glycemic management for patients with diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This parallel-Arm randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment was conducted from February 12, 2022, to April 15, 2023, with final measurements on November 18, 2023, among 260 patients with uncontrolled diabetes from a federally qualified health center in Austin, Texas, engaging telephonically from home. Intervention: Patients assigned to the intervention group received empathy-oriented telephone calls by community-hired laypeople for 6 months, while those assigned to the control group received usual care. Patients were stratified by baseline score (≥5 vs <5) on the depressive symptom scale of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c level at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, assessed for interaction between time and trial arm. Secondary outcomes were self-perceptions of managing diabetes, diabetes-related behaviors and distress, and mental health symptoms (measured via surveys). Analysis was performed on an intention-To-Treat basis. Results: Of 260 participants (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [10.1] years; 163 of 259 women [62.9%]; 176 of 203 [86.7%] with annual income <40000) enrolled, 6 withdrew. At 6 months, 204 of 254 (80.3%; intervention, 109 of 127 [85.8%] and control, 95 of 127 [74.8%]) returned for measurements. Participants in the intervention group had statistically significant mean (SD) decreases in hemoglobin A1c level at 6 months (from 10.0% [1.9%] to 9.3% [2.0%]) compared with those in the control group (from 9.8% [1.6%] to 9.7% [2.3%]) (P =.004). The within-person change in hemoglobin A1c level was-0.7% (95% CI,-1.0% to-0.4%) for the intervention group and 0.02% (95% CI,-0.4% to 0.4%) for the control group. For the subgroup with a PHQ-9 score of 5 or more at baseline (38.1% [99 of 260]), the within-person change in hemoglobin A1c was-1.1% (95% CI,-1.8% to-0.5%) for the intervention group and 0.1% (95% CI,-0.7% to 0.8%; P =.004) for the control group. For the subgroup with a PHQ-9 score less than 5, the within-person change in hemoglobin A1c was-0.4% (95% CI,-0.8% to-0.1%) for the intervention group and-0.02% (95% CI,-0.5% to 0.5%; P =.21) for the control group. At 6 months, 91.7% of the participants (99 of 108) responded that the program was very or extremely beneficial. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial of telephone-based layperson-delivered empathetic engagement, patients with diabetes and low income achieved clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control. With workforce constraints, layperson-delivered programs for diabetes show promise. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05173675.  © 2024 Kahlon MK et al.

Nagel E.M.; Peña A.; Dreyfuss J.M.; Lock E.F.; Johnson K.E.; Lu C.; Fields D.A.; Demerath E.W.; Isganaitis E.,"Gestational Diabetes, the Human Milk Metabolome, and Infant Growth and Adiposity",2024,JAMA Network Open,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.50467,"Importance: Gestational diabetes (GD) is linked to health risks for the birthing parent and infant. The outcomes of GD on human milk composition are mostly unknown. Objective: To determine associations between GD, the human milk metabolome, and infant growth and body composition. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cohort study using data from the Mothers and Infants Linked for Healthy Growth and the Maternal Milk, Metabolism, and the Microbiome studies at the University of Oklahoma and University of Minnesota, large prospective US cohorts with a high proportion of exclusive breastfeeding. Participants were mother-infant dyads recruited between October 2014 and August 2019 who planned to exclusively breastfeed for 3 or more months. Data were analyzed from July 2022 to August 2024. Exposure: GD diagnosed via oral glucose tolerance test. Main Outcomes and Measures: The milk metabolome was assessed by untargeted liquid chromatography-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry at 1 month post partum. Infant growth (weight for length z score, length for age z score, and rapid weight gain) and body composition (percentage body fat and fat-free mass index) from 0 to 6 months were assessed. Linear regression analyses tested associations between GD and milk metabolites, with adjustment for covariates and potential confounders. Results: Among 348 dyads (53 with GD), 27 (51%) of the GD-exposed infants were female and 157 (53%) of nonexposed infants were male; 10 (19%) were Asian, 2 (4%) were Black or African American, and 37 (70%) were White. The mean (SD) age was higher in the GD group (with GD, 34.0 [4.3] years; without GD, 30.7 [4.1] years). In adjusted models, GD was associated with differential levels of 9 metabolites of 458 tested (FDR<0.05); 3 were higher (2-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-methylphenylacetic acid, and pregnanolone sulfate) and 6 were lower in women with GD (4-cresyl sulfate, cresol, glycine, P-cresol sulfate, phenylacetic acid, and stearoylcarnitine). Phenylacetic acid was associated with length for age z score (β = 0.27; SE, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.16), 2-hydroxybutryic acid with percentage body fat (β = -1.50; SE, 0.66; 95% CI, -2.79 to -4.82), and stearoylcarnitine with greater odds of rapid weight gain (odds ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.25). GD was associated with greater length for age z scores (β = 0.48; SE, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.91). Conclusions and Relevance: In this observational cohort study, GD was associated with altered concentrations of several human milk metabolites. The associations between these metabolites and infant growth suggest that milk compositional differences in mothers with GD may beneficially moderate the growth and body composition of their infants.  ©2024 Nagel EM et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212459716,Metabolome
Takeuchi M.; Shinozaki T.; Kawakami K.,Universal Health Checkups and Risk of Incident Diabetes and Hypertension,2024,JAMA Network Open,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.51813,"Importance: Type 2 diabetes and hypertension are obesity-related, noncommunicable diseases becoming increasingly common worldwide. In 2008, Japan launched a nationwide universal health checkup program, Specific Health Checkup (SHC), for the primary prevention of obesity-related diseases, but its effectiveness has been understudied. Objective: To investigate the association of the SHC program with incident diabetes and hypertension, using a target trial emulation framework. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data from a longitudinal health care database involving both checkup history and medical encounter records in Japan. Individuals aged 40 to 74 years, without diabetes or hypertension, and without a prior checkup history, were eligible. Individuals were repeatedly assessed for eligibility from April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2020, to assemble sequential cohorts of 78620 SHC participants and 214554 nonparticipants. Statistical analysis was conducted from June 8 to December 30, 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: The composite risk of incident type 2 diabetes or hypertension over a period of up to 10 years, defined as the combination of a newly documented diagnosis and use of relevant medications. A propensity score-weighted survival analysis was conducted to adjust for baseline variables. A series of sensitivity analyses and a negative outcome control analysis were conducted using depression as a benchmark. Results: Sequential cohorts consisted of 78620 SHC participants (median age, 46 years [IQR, 41-53 years]; 62.7% women) and 214554 nonparticipants (median age, 49 years [IQR, 44-55 years]; 82.0% women) from 153084 unique persons, each of whom entered the study cohort a mean (SD) of 1.9 (1.5) times. Within a median follow-up of 4.2 years (IQR, 2.7-6.3 years), the primary end point occurred among 11.2% of all individuals (10.6% of the SHC participants and 11.4% of the nonparticipants), with a lower hazard ratio (HR) among the SHC recipients (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.89-0.92); the difference in cumulative incidence at 10 years was -1.6% (95% CI, -1.8% to -1.3%). The sensitivity analyses showed similar results. The negative control analysis suggested the potential for residual confounding (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07); the bias-calibrated HR was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84-0.89) for the primary outcome. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, within a median of 4.2 years of follow-up, SHC recipients had a 9.8% lower risk of incident diabetes and hypertension (13.8% in the bias-calibrated analysis). The cost-effectiveness of the SHC and its transportability to other regions are unclear, requiring future investigations. © 2024 American Medical Association.

Yang C.; Zhi J.; Xu Y.; Fan X.; Wu X.; Xu D.R.; Liao J.,A Couple-Based Intervention for Chinese Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial,2025,JAMA Network Open,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.52168,"Importance: Spousal involvement in diabetes care is recommended theoretically, but effectiveness in clinical settings and among diverse populations is unclear. Objective: To test the effect of a couple-based intervention among Chinese older patients with type 2 diabetes and their spouses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter randomized clinical trial comprised 2 arms: a couple-based intervention arm and an individual-based control. The trial was conducted across 14 community health care centers in Guangzhou, China, between September 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, and included patients with confirmed type 2 diabetes aged 55 years or older. Eligible partners were married to or cohabitated with the patients. Patients who previously participated in type 2 diabetes education courses were excluded, as were couples who both had diabetes, to make a clear distinction between patients and spouses. The data were analyzed between January 2023 and April 2024. Interventions: The interventions consisted of 4 weekly group education sessions followed by behavior change booster telephone calls over 2 months that targeted either patients and spouses (ie, intervention arm) or patients alone (ie, control arm). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 and 12 months post intervention. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels for patients and quality of life for their spouses. Collective efficacy and behaviors were secondary outcomes for both patients and spouses. Group comparisons were conducted using multilevel models based on an intention-to-treat approach, with outcome measures assessed for both patients and their spouses. Results: A total of 207 couples were included in the study, with 106 randomized to the intervention arm and 101 to the control arm. The mean (SD) age of patients was 66.0 (6.5) years, with 105 (50.7%) being men; spouses had similar demographics. Patients' HbA1c levels decreased in both arms over the 12-month follow-up, with no significant between-arm differences (β = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.57 to 0.42). Collective efficacy and collective behavior for patients increased after intervention but with a similar magnitude between arms. None of these measures showed between-arm differences among spouses in either arm. In subgroup analysis, decreases in HbA1c levels were constant and lasting in patients with high baseline HbA1c levels (≥8.0%) with a statistically significant difference. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings show that the overall treatment effect of the couple-based intervention was weak. However, the couple-based intervention benefited patients with poor glucose control. Patients' glucose levels, spouses' availability to provide support, and couples' collaborative preferences for mutual or individual diabetes management should be considered in tailoring treatment strategies among older adults with type 2 diabetes.  © 2025 Yang C et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214333680,Spouse

Objective: To assess the effect of a pharmacist-led management model incorporating a social media platform vs usual care on medication adherence in patients with CHF. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, multicenter randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 2021 to May 2023, with a follow-up duration of 52 weeks. The trial was conducted in the cardiology wards of 5 hospitals in China. Participants were 18 years or older, had a CHF diagnosis, and were receiving stable medication. They were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (pharmacist-led management) or the control group (usual care) in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated random number table with concealed allocation via opaque envelopes. Intention-to-treat data analysis was performed from June 2023 to July 2024. Intervention: The intervention group received a multimodal pharmaceutical intervention, including WeChat application-based communication and education, and a standardized follow-up visit from a pharmacist every month. The control group received the standardized follow-up visit from nurses every month. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of days covered (PDC) by heart failure medication at 52 weeks. Results: Among the 445 participants analyzed, 223 were assigned to the intervention group and 222 to the control group. These patients had a mean (SD) age of 63.2 (13.3) years and included 263 males (59.1%). A total of 333 patients (74.8%) had a New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, indicating severe limitations in physical activity. At 52 weeks, the intervention group had a significantly higher PDC for heart failure medication (8.1%; 95% CI, 5.5%-10.7%; P <.001) and a greater proportion of patients with PDC of 80% or greater (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21-0.54; P <.001) compared with the control group. Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found a modest improvement in medication adherence among patients with CHF who received the pharmacist-led management intervention vs usual care.  © 2024 Wang L et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213571896,Pharmaceutical Care
Rodriguez P.J.; Zhang V.; Gratzl S.; Do D.; Goodwin Cartwright B.; Baker C.; Gluckman T.J.; Stucky N.; Emanuel E.J.,Discontinuation and Reinitiation of Dual-Labeled GLP-1 Receptor Agonists Among US Adults With Overweight or Obesity,2025,JAMA Network Open,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.57349,"Importance: Adherence to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) is important for their effectiveness. Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns are not well understood. Objective: To describe rates of and factors associated with discontinuation and subsequent reinitiation of GLP-1 RAs among adults with overweight or obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective cohort study, 125474 adults with overweight or obesity newly initiated treatment with a dual-labeled GLP-1 RA (liraglutide, semaglutide, or tirzepatide) between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2023, with a baseline body mass index of 27 or more, an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation were identified using electronic health record data from a collective of US health care systems. Patients were followed up for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation. Exposure: Patients were stratified by presence of type 2 diabetes at baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportions of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations of sociodemographic characteristics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal adverse events with discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression models. All analyses were conducted separately for patients with and patients without type 2 diabetes. Results: In this cohort study of 125474 adults (mean [SD] age, 54.4 [13.1] years; 82063 women [65.4%]), 76524 (61.0%) had type 2 diabetes. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without type 2 diabetes (64.8% [95% CI, 64.4%-65.2%]) compared with those with type 2 diabetes (46.5% [95% CI, 46.2%-46.9%]). Higher weight loss (1% reduction in weight from baseline was associated with a 3.1% [95% CI, 2.9%-3.2%] lower hazard of discontinuation for patients with type 2 diabetes and a 3.3% [95% CI, 3.2%-3.5%] lower hazard of discontinuation for patients without type 2 diabetes) and higher income (type 2 diabetes only; >$80000: hazard ratio [HR], 0.72 [95% CI, 0.69-0.76]) were significantly associated with lower rates of discontinuation, while moderate or severe incident gastrointestinal adverse events were associated with a higher hazard of discontinuation (with type 2 diabetes: HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.31-1.45]; without type 2 diabetes: HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.12-1.27]). Of 41792 patients who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight measurement available, 1-year reinitiation was lower for those without type 2 diabetes (36.3% [95% CI, 35.6%-37.0%]) compared with those with type 2 diabetes (47.3% [95% CI, 46.6%-48.0%]). Weight regain of 1% from discontinuation was significantly associated with increased hazards of reinitiation of 2.3% (95% CI, 1.9%-2.8%) for patients with type 2 diabetes and 2.8% (95% CI, 2.4%-3.2%) for patients without type 2 diabetes. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, most patients with overweight or obesity discontinued GLP-1 RA therapy within 1 year, but those without type 2 diabetes had higher discontinuation rates and lower reinitiation rates. Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential to exacerbate disparities in obesity.  Copyright © 2025 Rodriguez PJ et al.

Objective: To longitudinally examine associations between baseline AD and ADRD BBMs and change in BBMs with cognition among participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and overweight or obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study was a clinical trial of older adults with T2D and overweight or obesity randomized to a 10-year intensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss or a diabetes support and education condition. Participants were recruited and followed up at 16 clinical sites across the US. Enrollment occurred from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2004. The primary intervention spanned the first 4 years after participants' enrollment (January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011). The clinical trial was stopped in September 2012 and was converted to an observational study. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and 8 to 12 years later. Cognitive assessments were performed from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014, and from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020. Data for the present cohort study were analyzed between January and August 2024. Exposures: Baseline and 8- to 12-year change in plasma levels of amyloid-β (Aβ)40, Aβ42, Aβ42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau-181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Main Outcomes and Measures: Cognitive composite z score and adjudicated mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia. Results: The mean (SD) baseline age of 758 participants was 61.5 (6.1) years, and 424 participants [55.9%] were female. Mean (SD) body mass index was 34.8 (5.3). Of the participants, 373 were randomized to diabetes support and education and 385 to intensive lifestyle intervention. Increasing baseline BBM levels were not associated with any cognitive composite z score. Increasing levels of NfL (β = -0.032 [SE, 0.013]; P =.01) and GFAP (β = -0.087 [SE, 0.025]; P <.001), but not the Aβ42/40 ratio (β = 0.006 [SE, 0.040]; P =.88) or pTau-181 (β = 0.026 [SE, 0.025]; P =.31), were associated with worsening cognitive function and incident mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia. The intervention had no association with 8- to 12-year change in BBM levels. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of participants with T2D and overweight or obesity, increasing plasma NfL and GFAP levels over time, but not Aβ42/40 or pTau-181 levels, were associated with cognitive decline and incident cognitive impairment. These results suggest that plasma NfL and GFAP may be important biomarkers of cognitive change among this patient population. © 2025 Mielke MM et al.

Given the limited data on the use of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems in type 2 diabetes, studies evaluating their safety and efficacy are important. Objective: To evaluate the association of AID with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in a diverse cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-arm prospective trial was conducted at 21 clinical centers in the United States among individuals aged 18 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes who had been using insulin for at least 3 months prior to screening. Participants with AID system use were excluded. The study started with a 14-day standard therapy phase, followed by 13 weeks of treatment with the investigational device. The first participant was enrolled April 11, 2023, and the last participant follow-up visit was February 29, 2024. Intervention: Participants used the Omnipod 5 AID System for 13 weeks following the 14-day standard therapy phase. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was change in HbA1c level at 13 weeks, tested sequentially for noninferiority (0.3% margin) and superiority, compared with baseline. Results: Among 305 participants (mean [SD] age, 57 [11] years; 175 [57%] female; 72 [24%] Black, 66 [22%] Hispanic or Latino, and 153 [50%] White), 289 (95%) completed the trial. At baseline, 223 (73%) were using multiple daily injections, 63 (21%) were using basal insulin without bolus, 17 (6%) were using an insulin pump, 188 (62%) were using continuous glucose monitoring, 168 (55%) were using glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and 134 (44%) were using sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is). Following AID use, HbA1c levels decreased from a mean (SD) of 8.2% (1.3) at baseline to 7.4% (0.9) at 13 weeks (mean difference, -0.8 [95% CI, -1.0 to -0.7] percentage points; P < .001 for noninferiority and superiority). Improvement was seen across various subgroups (age, sex, race and ethnicity, insurance), and notably with or without use of GLP-1RAs or SGLT-2is and regardless of pretrial mealtime insulin regimen. Time in target glucose range (70-180 mg/dL) increased from a mean (SD) of 45% (25) to 66% (17) (mean difference, 20 [95% CI, 18 to 22] percentage points; P < .001). Percentage of time in hypoglycemic ranges of less than 54 mg/dL and less than 70 mg/dL was noninferior compared with standard therapy. There was 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia and none of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. Conclusions and Relevance: In this nonrandomized clinical trial, HbA1c levels were lower in a diverse cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes following AID initiation, suggesting that AID may be a beneficial and safe option for people with type 2 diabetes using insulin.

Objective: To characterize the prevalence and factors associated with continuity of medication use for treatment of chronic illness among adults returning to the community from prison. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study linked administrative records and prescription claims from the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and the Medicaid program. The study included all adults (aged 18-64 years) released from a Wisconsin state correctional facility between April 1, 2015, and June 30, 2017, after incarceration of at least 31 days who enrolled in Medicaid within the month of release. Analyses were conducted between May 2022 and May 2024. Exposure: Receipt of a prescription medication commonly used for treatment of certain chronic conditions during the last 3 months of incarceration. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was medication continuity, which was defined as having a prescription medication claim in the first 6 months after release that was within the same chronic condition therapeutic class as the medication received during the last 3 months of incarceration. Results: This cohort study included 13792 individual releases representing 12960 individuals from the Wisconsin state prison system who immediately enrolled in Medicaid upon release. These individuals had a mean (SD) age of 35.5 (10.5) years; 89.5% were male. In terms of race, 38.5% of individuals were Black and 57.2% were White. For one-third of individual Medicaid-enrolled releases (4302 [31.2%]), the individual received a prescription medication for a chronic condition. Prescription continuity was observed for 51.7%, with variability across drug class ranging from less than 20.0% to 71.6%. Classes with the highest continuity (eg, thyroid agents) were also those that treated serious chronic conditions, although gaps between realized and clinically recommended care remained. Continuity varied by race, sex, and age. Individuals with continuity were more likely to have had an outpatient visit in the 6 months following release than those without continuity (93.9% vs 55.6%; P <.001) despite similar Medicaid enrollment. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, prescription continuity between prison release and the community was limited, even for drugs with high clinical need and relevance for population health and especially among individuals who did not receive outpatient care in the 6 months post incarceration. These findings suggest that effective transitional care interventions may need to include increased emphasis on connecting with clinicians.  © 2025Dague L et al.

Objective: To examine the associations of sleep duration and onset timing trajectories with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived glycemic metrics in adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed data collected from January 2014 to December 2023 in the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study, a prospective cohort in Guangdong province, China, among participants aged 46 to 83. Participants who had repeated sleep assessments at several study visits and were equipped with CGM devices at the last visit were included. Data analyses were conducted between January and June 2024. Exposures: The trajectories of sleep duration and onset timing were constructed using self-report sleep duration and sleep onset timing, recorded at multiple study visit points. Main Outcomes and Measures: Measurements of glycemic variability and glycemic control were collected using a masked CGM device worn by patients for 14 consecutive days. Huber robust regression models were used to assess the associations between sleep trajectories and CGM-derived metrics. Results: In this study of 1156 participants (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [5.1] years, 816 [70.6%] women), we identified 4 distinct sleep duration trajectory groups: severe inadequate, moderate inadequate, mild inadequate, and adequate. Severe sleep inadequacy was associated with an increment of glycemic variability indicators: 2.87% (95% CI, 1.23%-4.50%) for coefficient of variation and 0.06 (95% CI, 0.02-0.09) mmol/L for mean of daily differences. We found 2 trajectories of sleep onset timing: persistent early and persistent late groups. Late sleep onset was associated with larger coefficient of variation (β = 1.18%; 95% CI, 0.36%-2.01%) and mean of daily differences (β = 0.02 mmol/L; 95% CI, 0.01-0.04 mmol/L). Inappropriate sleep duration and timing trajectories in combination were associated with greater glycemic variability. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of middle-aged and older participants, persistent inadequate sleep duration and late sleep onset, whether alone or in combination, were associated with greater glycemic variability. These findings emphasize the importance of considering both sleep duration and timing for optimizing glycemic control in the general population.  © 2025 Shen L et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000529429,Sleep

Sleep is a crucial lifestyle factor associated with cardiometabolic health, yet studies on its role in the progression from GD to T2D are sparse. Objective: To investigate the associations of sleep duration and quality with T2D risk and levels of glucose metabolism biomarkers in women with a history of GD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the Nurses' Health Study II, an ongoing longitudinal cohort that began in 1989 and initially included 116429 female nurses with health status and lifestyle factors updated every 2 to 4 years. A subset of participants with a history of GD was followed up through June 2021. Sleep characteristics were assessed in the 2001 questionnaire (administered from June 2001 to June 2003), which served as the baseline for follow-up. Data were analyzed from November 2023 to August 2024. Exposures: Snoring frequency, sleep duration, and daytime sleepiness. Main Outcomes and Measures: Physician-diagnosed incident T2D was ascertained biennially via questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Biomarkers (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], C-peptide, and insulin) were compared across sleep characteristic categories using multivariable-adjusted least-squares means (LSMs) and 95% CIs. Results: During a total of 42155 person-years of follow-up among 2891 women with a history of GD (mean [SD] age, 45.3 [4.4] years), 563 women (19.5%) developed T2D. Compared with women who reported rarely snoring, those with occasional or regular snoring had significantly higher T2D risk, with adjusted HRs of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.18-2.02) and 1.61 (95% CI, 1.21-2.13), respectively. Compared with women who slept 7 to 8 hours per day, shorter sleep duration (≤6 hours per day) was significantly associated with a higher risk of T2D (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06-1.64). Women who slept 6 or fewer hours per day and snored regularly had the highest risk of developing T2D (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.38-3.07). Additionally, more frequent snoring was associated with higher HbA1c (LSM, 5.89; 95% CI, 5.75-6.02), C-peptide (LSM, 4.30; 95% CI, 3.70-4.99), and insulin (LSM, 11.25; 95% CI, 8.75-14.40) levels in the full adjusted models (P =.01 for trend for all). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of women with a history of GD, shorter sleep duration and both occasional and regular snoring were significantly associated with an increased risk of T2D. These findings suggest that improving sleep health may be important to reduce T2D incidence in this high-risk population.  © 2025 Yin X et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000583625,Glycated hemoglobin

Vaccination status and new-onset T2D were determined using the National Immunization Registry5 and the National Diabetes Database (eMethods 1 in Supplement 1). Covariates included demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status), vaccination status at test (index) date (T0), and comorbidities. Individuals were excluded for death within 30 days of T0, missing sociodemographic data, SARSCoV-2 infection within 300 days of T0, or preexisting T2D (eFigure in Supplement 1). The primary outcome of interest was new-onset T2D 31 to 300 days after T0 among individuals with vs without SARS-CoV-2 infection. This studywas considered national public health research under the Singapore Infectious Diseases Act; thus, patient consent and institutional review board approval were not required. Reporting followed the STROBE guideline. Baseline characteristics and between-group standardized mean differences (SMDs) were computed; overlap weighting was used to adjust for differences. Risk of new-onset T2D was estimated using competing-risks regression with death as a competing risk, with overlap weights applied; subgroup analyses included ethnicity, COVID-19 vaccination, and infection severity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with inverse probability weights or the doubly robust approach and the negative-outcome control (solid-organ malignant neoplasm).We constructed a historical cohort for influenza hospitalizations separately; risk of new-onset T2D after hospitalization for COVID-19 vs influenza was contrasted using competing-risks regression (eMethods 2 in Supplement 1). Analyses were conducted using R, version 4.3.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing). 95%CIs excluding 1 indicated significance. Results We compared individuals with vs without SARS-CoV-2 infection during Delta (82 212 vs 531 855) and Omicron (972 610 vs 1 039 276) predominance. SMDs were below 0.05 after weighting (Table 1). No overall increased risk of new-onset T2D was observed during Delta (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99 [95% CI, 0.92-1.06]) or Omicron (HR, 1.00 [95%CI, 0.97-1.03]) predominance; sensitivity analyses did not notably alter these estimates (Table 2). In subgroup analyses, increased postinfectious risk of T2D was observed during Delta predominance among Indian individuals but not among Chinese or Malay individuals. During Omicron predominance, elevated postinfectious risk of T2D (HR, 1.50 [95%CI, 1.06-2.11]) was observed among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals but not among fully vaccinated or boosted individuals. T2D riskwas not elevated among patients with mild SARS-CoV-2.(Table Presented).infection, but those hospitalized with COVID-19 had increased postinfectious risk. Elevated postinfectious risk persisted in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during Omicron predominance, even after excluding steroid-treated individuals. Compared with historical influenza hospitalizations, patients with COVID-19 had 45.0% higher postacute risk of T2D during Delta predominance vs 56.0% higher risk during Omicron predominance. For the negative-outcome control (malignant neoplasm), between-group risk did not differ notably.infection, but those hospitalized with COVID-19 had increased postinfectious risk. Elevated postinfectious risk persisted in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during Omicron predominance, even after excluding steroid-treated individuals.

For the negative-outcome control (malignant neoplasm), between-group risk did not differ notably. Discussion No overall increased risk of new-onset T2D after SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed in our cohort. Earlier pre-Omicron studies reported increased (27%-46%) diabetes risk after SARS-CoV-2 infection.1-3 Although increased risk was observed following Omicron infection in Hong Kong adults4 and no notable decrease was observed among boosted Korean individuals (vs primary vaccination),6 58.4% of Hong Kong individuals had not completed primary vaccination and 66% of Korean individuals were boosted4,6; 89.4% of our population was boosted. Interethnic differences in insulin resistance pathophysiology may influence diabetogenic risk after infection. Study limitations include results that may not be fully generalizable to populations of different ethnicities or lower vaccination uptake and absence of physical measurements. We observed no overall increased risk of new-onset T2D after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection among a highly vaccinated and boosted multiethnic Asian cohort during Omicron predominance; risk was elevated among Indian individuals during Delta predominance, unvaccinated individuals, and hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Risk of T2D after hospitalization was higher for the COVID-19 cohort vs the historical influenza cohort. Future research is required to evaluate the risk of new-onset T2D after COVID-19 vs other viral infections. © 2025 American Medical Association.

For dementia research, diagnosed health conditions that bring patients into frequent interaction with health care may increase the chance that an individual receives a dementia diagnosis. Objective: To evaluate potential detection bias or misdiagnosis bias in evaluation of clinical factors associated with dementia using electronic health record (EHR) data. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used data from 2 population-based volunteer cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB) and All of Us (AOU). Participants were aged 55 years or older, were dementia-free at baseline, and had linked EHRs. Participants in UKB were followed up from baseline (2006-2010) until December 2022, and in AOU, from baseline (2017-2022) until July 2022. Data were analyzed from November 2023 through February 2025. Exposures: Diagnoses of type 2 diabetes, depression, hypertension, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, forearm fracture, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rate of incident all-cause dementia diagnosis from EHRs and associations between clinical exposures and incident dementia diagnosis, assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: Among 228392 participants from UKB (n = 137374; mean [SD] age at baseline, 62.5 [4.1] years; 53.8% female) and AOU (n = 91018; mean [SD] age at baseline, 66.9 [7.8] years; 57.1% female), those with a history of a clinical exposure at baseline had higher dementia incidence rates compared with those without such history. For example, among participants with a history of GI bleeding, the dementia incidence rates were 3.0 (UKB) and 7.7 (AOU) per 1000 person-years compared with 2.2 (UKB) and 2.4 (AOU) per 1000 person-years among those without a history of GI bleeding. All exposures were significantly associated with incident dementia, with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging from 1.18 (95% CI, 1.00-1.40) to 3.51 (95% CI, 3.08-4.01). Risk of incident dementia was typically highest in the first year following exposure diagnosis and attenuated thereafter. For example, in the first year after GI bleeding, there were larger elevations in risk of incident dementia (HR, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.46-3.22] in UKB; HR, 2.56 [95% CI, 1.62-4.04] in AOU) compared with 1 to 5 years after bleeding (HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.15-1.86] in UKB; HR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.63-2.81] in AOU). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of 2 large datasets, diagnoses of several conditions associated with varying risks of dementia were associated with a higher short-term likelihood of dementia diagnosis. This finding suggests that diagnostic bias or misdiagnoses may lead to spurious associations between conditions requiring clinical care and subsequent dementia diagnoses.. © 2025 American Medical Association.

Insulin titration for glycemic control in T2D is crucial but limited by the lack of personalized and real-time tools. Objective: To examine whether an artificial intelligence-based insulin clinical decision support system (iNCDSS) for glycemic control in hospitalized patients with T2D is noninferior to standard insulin therapy administered by senior physicians. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, single-blind, parallel randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted between October 1, 2021, and September 8, 2022, in endocrinology wards of 3 medical centers. Eligible participants were adults (aged ≥18 years) with glycated hemoglobin levels between 7.0% and 11.0% who had received antidiabetic treatments in the previous 3 months. Interventions: Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive insulin dosage titration by iNCDSS or senior endocrinology physicians for 5 consecutive days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of time in the target glucose range (70-180 mg/dL) during the 5-day study period; the noninferiority margin was 6 percentage points. Secondary outcomes included other glycemic control measurements and adverse events. Results: A total of 149 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.2 [12.0] years; 84 male [56.4%]) were enrolled and randomized to the iNCDSS group (n = 75) or physician group (n = 74). The mean (SD) target glucose range (primary outcome) was 76.4% (16.4%) in the iNCDSS group and 73.6% (16.8%) in the physician group, which achieved the prespecified noninferiority criterion (estimated treatment difference, 2.7%; 95% CI, -2.7% to 8.0%). There were no significant differences in adverse events between the 2 groups. Most physicians were satisfied with the iNCDSS for its clear, time-saving, effective, and safe clinical support. Conclusions and Relevance: In this RCT of an iNCDSS, the system demonstrated noninferiority to senior endocrinology physicians in insulin titration in an inpatient setting, indicating its potential as a favorable tool for insulin titration in patients with T2D.

Methods: Participants were 823 older adults (mean age, 64.6 years; 77% women) with knee osteoarthritis and overweight or obesity who resided in rural (n = 410) and urban (n = 413) counties in North Carolina. All were enrolled in the Weight Loss and Exercise for Communities with Arthritis in North Carolina clinical trial that randomly assigned participants to either 18 months of D + E or C interventions. General linear models were used to examine differences in clinical outcomes between rural and urban groups after adjusting for covariates. Results: The rural group had significant differences (P < 0.05) at baseline in clinical outcomes, education, comorbidities, medication use, and income compared with the urban dwellers. After adjusting for baseline differences, the group (rural or urban) by treatment (D + E or C) interactions for Western Ontario McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain (rural: D + E – C = −0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] −1.31 to 0.06; urban: D + E − C= −0.29, 95% CI −0.99 to 0.41; P = 0.50) and WOMAC function (rural: D + E − C = −4.60, 95% CI −6.89 to −2.31; urban: D + E − C = −1.38, 95% CI −3.73 to 0.94; P = 0.054) indicated that the groups responded similarly to the interventions. Conclusion: Among participants with knee osteoarthritis and overweight or obesity, D + E compared to C led to similar pain outcomes in rural and urban dwellers that favored D + E. The possibility that there may be greater differential efficacy in functional outcomes among rural participants needs further study. (Figure presented.). © 2024 The Author(s).

Methods: Cross-sectional study of the first consecutive 200 PNP and 1,100 NNP patients evaluated at a Neuro-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinic between May 2020 and March 2023. Patients were divided into younger (18–44 years), middle-age (45–64 years), and older (65+ years) age groups. Results: Younger and middle-age individuals accounted for 142 of 200 (71%) of PNP and 995 of 1100 (90.5%) of NNP patients. Significant age-related differences in the frequencies of comorbidities and abnormal neurologic findings demonstrated higher prevalence in older patients. Conversely, 10 months from COVID-19 onset, we found significant age-related differences in Neuro-PASC symptoms indicating lower prevalence, and therefore, symptom burden, in older individuals. Moreover, there were significant age-related differences in subjective impression of fatigue (median [interquartile range (IQR)] patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] score: younger 64 [57–69], middle-age 63 [57–68], older 60.5 [50.8–68.3]; p = 0.04) and sleep disturbance (median [IQR] PROMIS score: younger 57 [51–63], middle-age 56 [53–63], older 54 [46.8–58]; p = 0.002) in the NNP group, commensurate with higher impairment in quality of life (QoL) among younger patients. Finally, there were significant age-related differences in objective executive function (median [IQR] National Institutes of Health [NIH] toolbox score: younger 48 [35–63], middle-age 49 [38–63], older 54.5 [45–66.3]; p = 0.01), and working memory (median [IQR] NIH toolbox score: younger 47 [40–53], middle-age 50 [44–57], older 48 [43–58]; p = 0.0002) in NNP patients, with the worst performance coming from the younger group. Interpretation: Younger and middle-age individuals are disproportionally affected by Neuro-PASC regardless of acute COVID-19 severity. Although older people more frequently have abnormal neurologic findings and comorbidities, younger and middle-age patients suffer from a higher burden of Neuro-PASC symptoms and cognitive dysfunction contributing to decreased QoL. Neuro-PASC principally affects adults in their prime, contributing to profound public health and socioeconomic impacts warranting dedicated resources for prevention, diagnosis and interventions.

This study aimed to identify the pathogenic signal pathway and elucidate urinary biomarkers for predicting the presence or severity of histologic findings in LN. Methods: Urine samples from patients with biopsy-proven active LN were screened for 1,305 proteins using an aptamer-based proteomic assay. The diversity and expansion of individual renal histologic features in LN were quantified to identify the urinary proteins associated with the histologic findings found in each score. Candidate urinary proteins were validated in a validation cohort. Immunohistochemical staining of the renal tissues was performed to clarify the localization of the candidate proteins. Results: Cluster analysis extracted five histologic subgroups according to their correlations with each histologic finding in LN. Protein groups that correlated with each histologic subgroup revealed a distinct pathogenesis in LN using pathway analyses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay validation revealed that urinary calgranulin B (S100A9), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5) levels could specifically predict the presence and severity of active glomerular lesions, interstitial inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the localization of these proteins in each lesion. Conclusion: Renal histologic findings may reflect the different pathogeneses involved in each lesion, and estimating the urinary calgranulin B, MCP-1, and IGFBP-5 levels may be useful in predicting the presence and severity of histologic findings in LN. © 2024 The Author(s).

Depending on the severity of dissection, the approach to management ranges from monitoring to surgical intervention; more extensive dissections into the ascending aorta, typically more than 40 mm above the coronary ostium, are considered an indication for surgery. We report six cases of IAD, highlighting the critical considerations concerning conservative management. These cases highlight the potential role of individualized management strategies, demonstrating instances where a conservative stance may prove effective in ensuring an optimal patient outcome and the key procedural features essential to optimize outcomes when considering nonsurgical management. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209816494,Conservative Management

In practice, GFR is typically estimated by serum creatinine concentration, but creatinine may not be a reliable indicator of GFR decline in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use. Alternative filtration markers such as cystatin C, β-trace protein (BTP), and β2-microglobulin (B2M) may be more appropriate, but little is known about how these markers are affected by SGLT2 inhibitor use. Therefore, we determined creatinine, cystatin C, BTP, and B2M concentration in a crossover study of 35 people with type 2 diabetes receiving 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment or placebo. Estimated GFR (eGFR) based on creatinine (eGFRcre), cystatin C (eGFRcys), their combination (eGFRcomb), or a panel of all four markers (eGFRpanel) was compared with measured GFR (mGFR) based on plasma clearance of chromium-51 labeled ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA). Dapagliflozin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in mGFR (−9 mL/min/1.73 m2, P < 0.001) but not a corresponding increase in concentration of any filtration marker. No eGFR equation accurately predicted change in mGFR between treatment periods, but eGFRcomb and eGFRpanel yielded the highest overall accuracy relative to mGFR across both treatment periods. These findings highlight the stability in performance gained by combining multiple filtration markers but suggest that eGFR in general is not an ideal metric for assessing short-term GFR decline in people initiating SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. © 2024 The Author(s).

All patients with incident T2D in Taiwan National Health Institution databases (2016–2021) and TriNetX datasets (2014–2023) were retrospectively analyzed. The study analyzed a propensity score-matched pairs with T2D treated with SGLT2i or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i). The primary outcome was the incidence of urolithiasis and urolithiasis requiring surgery during the study period. Urolithiasis diagnoses were identified using International Classification of Diseases diagnostic codes and categorized into upper and lower urinary tract stones. Cases of urolithiasis requiring surgery were determined by the presence of both diagnostic codes and surgical procedure codes within the same outpatient visit or hospitalization. Conditional and time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During the study period, 5700 participants were diagnosed with urolithiasis, 1297 participants were urolithiasis requiring surgery in Taiwan NHIRD cohort 8438 participants with urolithiasis as well as 289 participants with urolithiasis requiring surgery were in the TriNetX cohort. Adjusted HRs of urolithiasis and urolithiasis requiring surgery were 0.82-fold (95% CI, 0.77–0.87), 0.72-fold (95% CI, 0.63–0.82) in Taiwan NHIRD, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78–0.90), and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.44–0.88) in TriNetX cohort respectively. Similar protective associations with SGLT2i use against urolithiasis were observed across subgroups in both datasets from Taiwan NHIRD and TriNetX. In conclusion, SGLT2i might protect against kidney stones and severe cases requiring surgery in T2D patients. © 2025 The Author(s).

Gilbody J.; Borges M.C.; Davey Smith G.; Sanderson E.,Multivariable MR Can Mitigate Bias in Two-Sample MR Using Covariable-Adjusted Summary Associations,2025,Genetic Epidemiology,10.1002/gepi.22606,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are hypothesis-free studies that estimate the association between polymorphisms across the genome with a trait of interest. To increase power and to estimate the direct effects of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a trait GWAS are often conditioned on a covariate (such as body mass index or smoking status). This adjustment can introduce bias in the estimated effect of the SNP on the trait. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) studies use summary statistics from GWAS estimate the causal effect of a risk factor (or exposure) on an outcome. Covariate adjustment in GWAS can bias the effect estimates obtained from MR studies conducted using covariate adjusted GWAS data. Multivariable MR (MVMR) is an extension of MR that includes multiple traits as exposures. Here we propose the use of MVMR to correct the bias in MR studies from covariate adjustment. We show how MVMR can recover unbiased estimates of the direct effect of the exposure of interest by including the covariate used to adjust the GWAS within the analysis. We apply this method to estimate the effect of systolic blood pressure on type-2 diabetes and the effect of waist circumference on systolic blood pressure. Our analytical and simulation results show that MVMR provides unbiased effect estimates for the exposure when either the exposure or outcome of interest has been adjusted for a covariate. Our results also highlight the parameters that determine when MR will be biased by GWAS covariate adjustment. The results from the applied analysis mirror these results, with equivalent results seen in the MVMR with and without adjusted GWAS. When GWAS results have been adjusted for a covariate, biasing MR effect estimates, direct effect estimates of an exposure on an outcome can be obtained by including that covariate as an additional exposure in an MVMR estimation. However, the estimated effect of the covariate obtained from the MVMR estimation is biased. © 2025 The Author(s).

Methods: In these ongoing double-blind trials, participants were randomized to once-weekly subcutaneous injections of survodutide or placebo added to lifestyle modification. Survodutide doses are uptitrated to 3.6 or 6.0 mg, and dose flexibility is permitted. Participants (n = 726) in SYNCHRONIZE-1 (NCT06066515) have a baseline BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 with at least one obesity-related complication but without T2D; participants (n = 755) in SYNCHRONIZE-2 (NCT06066528) have a baseline BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 and T2D. The primary endpoints are percentage change in body weight and proportion of participants achieving ≥5% body weight reduction from baseline to week 76. Secondary endpoints include change in systolic blood pressure and measures of glycemia. A SYNCHRONIZE-1 substudy is evaluating changes in body composition and liver fat content using magnetic resonance imaging.

Methods: We analyzed data from 98 cognitively normal midlife participants (mean age: 49.4 [SD 6.2] years; 34 males [34.7%]; 56 with obesity [57.1%]). Participants underwent brain and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood tests, and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT and SAT, respectively) was segmented, and Centiloids were calculated. Diffusion basis spectrum imaging parameter maps were created using an in-house script, and tract-based spatial statistics assessed white matter differences in high versus low BMI values, VAT, SAT, insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, and Centiloids, with age and sex as covariates. Results: Obesity, high VAT, and high SAT were linked to lower axial diffusivity, reduced fiber fraction, and increased restricted fraction in white matter. Obesity was additionally associated with higher hindered fraction and lower fractional anisotropy. Also, individuals with high C-reactive protein showed lower axial diffusivity. Higher restricted fraction correlated with continuous BMI and SAT particularly in male individuals, whereas VAT effects were similar in male and female individuals. Conclusions: The findings suggest that, at midlife, obesity and abdominal fat are associated with reduced brain axonal density and increased inflammation, with visceral fat playing a significant role in both sexes.

Methods: Data on 8 indicators of cardiometabolic health, 21 anthropometric measures, and 11 anthropometric indices were available for 216 twin pairs of individuals age 3 to 18 years living in the Autonomous Region of Madeira, Portugal (51% girls). Genetic twin modeling was used to estimate genetic and environmental correlations between the cardiometabolic and anthropometric indicators. Results: Anthropometric indicators were positively associated with blood pressure and triglycerides and inversely associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The associations with glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and heart rate were close to zero. BMI and waist circumference showed similar or slightly higher absolute correlations with cardiometabolic health indicators compared with other anthropometric indices. Additive genetic and unique environmental correlations were at the same level as trait correlations. Conclusions: BMI and waist circumference provide information on cardiometabolic health that is not less accurate than that provided by more comprehensive anthropometric indices. These associations reflect causal associations between obesity and cardiometabolic disorders rather than only shared genetic associations. Measuring obesity is important for monitoring cardiometabolic risks and can be accomplished using simple indicators at the population level. © 2024 The Author(s).

Vasopressin improves body composition and protects against hypoglycemia. Associations of copeptin, a stable cleavage product of vasopressin, with BMI and insulin resistance suggest an adaptive increase in vasopressin to counteract metabolic disruption. To our knowledge, no study has investigated copeptin before and after MBS in humans. This study's aim was to investigate copeptin changes following MBS and associations with metabolic parameters. Methods: This was a 12-month longitudinal study of 64 youth (78% female; mean age 18.7 [SD 2.8] y) with obesity (mean BMI 45.6 [SD 6.8] kg/m2) undergoing MBS (n = 34) or nonsurgical (NS) lifestyle management (n = 30). Fasting copeptin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), body composition, and resting energy expenditure (REE) were assessed. Results: Over 12 months, copeptin increased more (time-by-treatment p = 0.017) whereas HbA1c and adiposity decreased more after MBS than NS (ps ≤ 0.036). Copeptin changes correlated negatively with percentage fat mass and REE changes (rho ≤ −0.29; ps ≤ 0.025) in the whole group, and they correlated positively with HbA1c and HOMA-IR (rho ≥ 0.41; false discovery rate–adjusted p = 0.05) and negatively with REE changes (rho = −0.55; false discovery rate–adjusted p = 0.036) in the MBS group. Conclusions: Increases in copeptin after weight loss in MBS compared with NS were associated with lower REE and higher HbA1c/HOMA-IR values.

Methods: Efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg were evaluated in the STEP clinical trials. In this post hoc analysis, STEP 1, 3, 6, and 8 (which included people with overweight or obesity) and, separately, STEP 2 and 6 (which included people with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes) were pooled for analysis. Changes in antihypertensive or lipid-lowering treatment intensity from randomization to end of treatment were evaluated. Results: In both pooled samples, a higher proportion of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group versus placebo underwent antihypertensive or lipid-lowering treatment intensity reduction by end of treatment. A smaller proportion underwent antihypertensive or lipid-lowering treatment intensification by end of treatment in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group of both samples versus placebo. In participants receiving antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medications in both samples, greater numeric reductions in body weight were observed in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group versus placebo. Conclusions: These results support a relationship between semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment of overweight and obesity and reduced need for antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment, facilitating treatment intensity reduction/discontinuation and abating treatment intensification.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and tolerability of β-alanine supplementation and to explore the effects on cardiometabolic health and cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal function in adults with overweight and obesity. Methods: A total of 27 adults (44% female; mean [SD], age: 58 [10] years, BMI: 31.1 [2.9] kg/m2, hemoglobin A1c: 39.8 [4.3] mmol/mol) received β-alanine (4.8 g/day) or a matched placebo for 3 months. Feasibility and tolerability outcomes included adherence, side effects, recruitment, attrition, and blinding, and exploratory outcomes included biochemical markers, blood pressures, and transthoracic echocardiography parameters. Data were analyzed using a Bayesian approach presented with 95% credible intervals (CrI). Results: β-alanine was well tolerated and adhered to (adherence: placebo, 0.91 [95% CrI: 0.84–0.95]; β-alanine, 0.92 [95% CrI: 0.85–0.95]), and side effects remained at or below baseline throughout. The probability that β-alanine supplementation affected cardiometabolic, cardiovascular, or clinical biochemical outcomes was low. Conclusions: Sustained-release β-alanine supplementation is well tolerated and adhered to in adults with overweight and obesity.

The purpose of this research was to determine the prevalence of thiamine deficiency in patients with obesity at a medical weight-management clinic and assess the relationship between recent weight loss and thiamine deficiency. Methods: For this observational study, medical records were reviewed for patients (n = 146) at the nonsurgical obesity medicine and preoperative bariatric surgery clinic at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center between January 1, 2012, and January 31, 2019. Thiamine deficiency was defined as a value less than the test reference range. χ2 tests were used to assess differences in thiamine deficiency by race, gender, and type 2 diabetes status. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between weight loss and thiamine deficiency. Results: Thiamine deficiency was found in 32.2% of patients. There were no differences in the prevalence of deficiency by gender, race, or type 2 diabetes status. Weight loss was associated with increased risk for deficiency, although this was not statistically significant (odds ratio = 2.04, 95% CI: 0.79–5.27).

Methods: Data on the prevalence of and costs associated with obesity and obesity-related complications (ORCs) were applied within an adapted simulation model to evaluate weight-loss benefits for a 2023 Swedish population over 10 years. The 10-year incidence of 10 ORCs and treatment costs in a random cohort of 10,000 individuals were estimated for a stable weight scenario and four weight-loss (5%–20%) scenarios. Results: The model included 887,272 individuals with obesity aged 20 to 60 years. Hypertension (24.1%), asthma (20.9%), dyslipidemia (18.3%), and type 2 diabetes (10.6%) were highly prevalent. For 10,000 individuals, a 5% to 20% weight loss was estimated to prevent ORCs over 10 years, leading to annual savings between 9.0 million Swedish krona (SEK)/€0.8 million (5% weight loss) and 30.0 million SEK/€2.6 million (20%) by 2033. Conclusions: Annual treatment costs of ORCs in Sweden will double over 10 years, and weight loss would be associated with significant savings because of the reductions in the incidence of ORCs.

Athinarayanan S.J.; Volek J.S.,Mitigating muscle loss during weight loss: can nutritional ketosis make a difference? A call for more research,2025,Obesity,10.1002/oby.24235,"Weight loss (WL) has an important role in managing obesity and type 2 diabetes, but preserving lean body mass (LBM) during WL is essential for maintaining muscle function and metabolic health. Significant WL with incretin mimetic-based therapies, similar to bariatric surgery, raises concerns regarding disproportionate LBM loss, which may lead to physical frailty. Recent analyses have suggested that high adherence to a ketogenic diet may mitigate LBM loss while improving physical function, even with substantial WL. However, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind LBM preservation in nutritional ketosis and the role of other lifestyle interventions. Future studies of pharmacological, surgical, and lifestyle-driven WL interventions should also assess LBM, physical function, and frailty.

Methods: Fifty-three AA and 54 EA participants were classified into “high” or “low” BMI groups using the sample median (25.9 kg/m2) as the cut point. The GRS was derived from 52 previously identified genetic variants. Skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity was measured with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity were calculated from oral glucose tolerance test values to determine hepatic and whole-body insulin sensitivity, respectively. Linear regression models, stratified by race, assessed interactions between BMI status and GRS on measures of insulin sensitivity. Results: In EA participants, associations of GRS with HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index differed by BMI status, where the GRS was associated with IR in the high-BMI group only. In AA participants, associations from the clamp differed by BMI status, but an association was observed only in the low-BMI group.

Methods: Changes in BMI, waist circumference, and total percent fat mass were obtained over 8 years among 1316 individuals (aged 45–76 years) enrolled in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) clinical trial of weight loss. Generalized linear models were used to assess relationships between 5% decreases in adiposity measures with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin use over time. Results: A 5% reduction in total percent fat was associated with 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12%–0.18%) lower mean HbA1c. Similarly, 5% reductions in waist circumference and BMI were also associated with slightly lower mean HbA1c: 0.16% (95% CI: 0.13%–0.19%) and 0.13% (95% CI: 0.11%–0.16%), respectively. These reductions were associated with lower odds of insulin use over time, ranging from 21% lower odds for a 5% reduction in percent body fat to 32% lower odds for 5% reductions in waist circumference and BMI. Associations were evident across subgroups defined by sex, diabetes duration, obesity status, and intervention assignment. Conclusions: Reductions in adiposity are associated with stabilized and slightly lower HbA1c and a marked reduction in the need for insulin therapy.

TRE showed lower metabolic flexibility than CR (−0.041 [95% CI: −0.080 to −0.002]). Weight, body composition, caloric intake, and glycemic measures were similar among groups. Eating window reduction correlated with decreased caloric intake and visceral fat. Conclusions: In a 12-week intervention, TRE did not lead to significant improvements in weight, average body composition, or glycemic or metabolic measures compared with CR or UE. © 2025 The Author(s).

This post hoc analysis assessed body weight changes with tirzepatide by reproductive stage. Methods: Women participants from SURMOUNT-1, -3, and -4 randomized to tirzepatide (15 mg or maximum tolerated dose) or placebo were retrospectively categorized as being in the pre-, peri-, or post-menopause stages. Body weight and waist circumference changes, the proportion of participants achieving body weight-reduction thresholds, and waist to height ratio (WHtR) category shift among those with baseline BMI < 35 kg/m2 were assessed at end of study treatment. Results: In SURMOUNT-1, significantly greater body weight reductions from baseline were observed with tirzepatide versus placebo in women in the premenopause (26% vs. 2%), perimenopause (23% vs. 3%), and postmenopause stages (23% vs. 3%; p < 0.001). Greater waist circumference reductions were also observed with tirzepatide across the subgroups (22 vs. 4 cm, 20 vs. 5 cm, and 20 vs. 4 cm, respectively; p < 0.001). Across the reproductive stage subgroups, 97% to 98% of participants achieved body weight reductions that were ≥5% with tirzepatide versus 29% to 33% with placebo. Furthermore, 30% to 52% of women among the reproductive stage subgroups who had baseline BMI < 35 kg/m2 reached WHtR ≤ 0.49 (low central adiposity) with tirzepatide. Similar results were observed in SURMOUNT-3 and -4. Conclusions: In this post hoc analysis, tirzepatide treatment was associated with significant body weight, waist circumference, and WHtR reductions versus placebo in women living with obesity or overweight and without type 2 diabetes, irrespective of reproductive stage.

Using data from the Aviitam platform in France, this study aimed to do the following: 1) explore psychological and behavioral patterns through clustering techniques; 2) validate the robustness of these clusters; and 3) assess their association with weight-loss outcomes in severe obesity under semaglutide treatment. Methods: Phase 1 included 989 adults with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 who completed validated questionnaires, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2). Phase 2 validated robustness in 492 individuals. Phase 3 applied clusters to 125 individuals with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 who were treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg/week at Montpellier University Hospital, assessing weight-loss trajectories over 12 months. Results: The following two clusters were identified: the Intuitive Eaters Group (IEG, n = 482); and the Emotionally Driven Eaters Group (EDEG, n = 507). The IEG exhibited lower emotional distress and higher intuitive eating scores. HADS and IES-2 distinguished clusters effectively (area under the curve, 0.95). Robustness was confirmed in Phase 2. In Phase 3, the IEG demonstrated a significantly more favorable weight-loss trajectory compared to the EDEG (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral clusters identified through HADS and IES-2 are associated with weight loss under semaglutide treatment, suggesting the value of integrating psychological and behavioral profiling into obesity care. © 2025 The Author(s).

Methods: Patients with (likely) pathogenic MC4R variants were included. HC, height, and weight were measured, and BMI and standard deviation score (SDS) were calculated. HC SDS was compared to the Dutch reference population. Children were matched 1:1 to a control group with common obesity. Results: Children with MC4R deficiency (n = 63, mean age, 10.32 years) had significantly larger HC (mean, +1.73 SDS) compared to the reference population (0 SDS; p < 0.001) and controls (+1.22 SDS; p = 0.009). In adults (n = 13), HC (median, + 0.86 SDS) did not differ from the reference population (0 SDS; p = 0.152). Macrocephaly (HC ≥ 2 SDS) was present in 43%, 25%, and 23% of pediatric patients with MC4R deficiency, controls, and adult patients, respectively. Children with MC4R deficiency were taller than controls (+1.00 SDS vs. +0.42 SDS; p = 0.016), with similar BMI (+3.99 SDS vs. +3.75 SDS; p = 0.157). HC SDS was associated with height SDS (R2, 0.22; p < 0.001) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (correlation coefficient, 0.542; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Macrocephaly is a common feature of patients with MC4R deficiency. We recommend measuring HC in patients suspected for genetic obesity, as it can be a clue for MC4R deficiency. © 2025 The Author(s).

The objective was to investigate if patients taking a low-dose formulation of phentermine had improved weight loss. Methods: This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial including patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Anthropometric and serological data were collected during the initial consult visit and again during two follow-up visits. Lomaira is a low-dose formulation of phentermine. Patients took 8-mg tablets three times a day for 14 weeks. The primary outcome of this study was weight loss, which was measured as percentage total weight loss (%TWL) and change in body mass index (BMI). Results: Among 53 participants randomized, 45 (85%) completed the trial. Participants were predominantly female (91%); the mean age was 41 years (SD = 11); and the mean initial BMI was 48.4 kg/m2 (SD = 8.2 kg/m2). Average weight loss was 6.2 kg (SD = 6) in the treatment group versus 1.1 kg (SD = 4.54) in the placebo group (p = 0.001). Average % TWL was greater in treatment Group 4.7 ± 4.3 versus placebo Group 1.1 ± 3.6, p = 0.001. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that preoperative medication use was significantly associated with greater %TWL (p = 0.004). There was no difference in OR time or post-operative complications between the groups. Conclusions: Low-dose phentermine is efficacious and safe for preoperative weight loss in patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery. © 2025 The Author(s).

Objective: This study evaluated the factors associated with individual variability in response to enrolling in a weight management program integrated into an academic-based primary care practice. Methods: Data were retrospectively collected and analyzed for patients referred to a primary care-based weight management practice between 2012 and 2020. A mixed-model, semi-parametric group-based modeling approach was used to identify group membership and explore weight change trajectories over 18 months, as measured by the percent of initial body weight loss and the probability of losing at least 5% of initial body weight (IBW). Results: Three hundred ninety-three patients were included in the study; the median age was 53 years, 84% female, 40% self-identified as non-Hispanic Black, and about one-third white. Among those, 374 had sufficient follow-up data for group-based modeling. Four groups were identified and named: “Weight Gainers” added 1.3% of IBW; “Initial Resistors” lost 6.7% of IBW; “Early Maintainers” lost 7.1% of IBW; and “Steady Achievers” lost 15% of IBW. Weight change in all groups was over 18 months. The probability of losing 5% IBW was described by three groups: “Minimal Late Responders,” “Moderate Responders,” and “High Early Responders.” Younger age, non-Hispanic Black race, fewer follow-up visits, and lower proportion prescribed two or more anti-obesity medications (AOMs) simultaneously were associated with a lower probability of achieving 5% IBW. Conclusions: Compared to the other groups, Weight Gainers and Minimal Late Responders had a distinct trajectory associated with two modifiable factors: the number of treatment visits and AOMs. Tailored interventions targeting these factors early may increase the probability of meaningful weight loss. © 2025 The Author(s).

Aim: To compare the night-time (from 00 to 07 a.m.) effectiveness in achieving recommended glycemic targets of three different AHCL systems in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 55 adults with T1D (mean age 41 ± 16 years, male 40%, diabetes duration 19.4 ± 11.4 years, BMI 24.1 ± 4.1 kg/m2) with similar glycemic control (GMI 7.0–7.4%). Twenty-two participants were using the Minimed 780G system, 18 the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ system and 15 the DBLG1 system. Continuous glucose monitoring derived metrics and insulin requirement of 14 consecutive nights were analyzed. Results: All three groups achieved the recommended mean TIR > 70%, mean TBR < 4%, and mean CV < 36% with a similar insulin requirement (Minimed 780G system: TIR 73.9 ± 11.2%, TBR 0.9 ± 1.2%, CV 29 ± 6.7%; Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ system: TIR 74.1 ± 11.1%, TBR 1.1 ± 1.0%, CV 34.5 ± 6.6%; DBLG1 System TIR 71.7 ± 11.3%, TBR 1.4 ± 3.7%, CV 32.4 ± 7.1%). Tight TIR% (70–140 mg/dl) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ group (51.5 ± 9.8%) when compared to Minimed 780G group (42.1 ± 13.7%) and DBLG1 System (40.1 ± 10.5%). In all three groups the insulin infusion similarly decreased from midnight to 05.00 am and then increased. Conclusions: All the three AHCL systems achieved the recommended TIR, TBR and CV without difference in insulin requirement. The Tandem Control-IQ system obtained a higher tight TIR. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209904392,Insulin delivery

Despite their widespread use, these methods do not account for other factors that also contribute to the variability of DNA methylation data. For example, many CpG sites show strong sex-specific or cell-type-specific patterns that likely impact the predictions of epigenetic age. To overcome these limitations, we developed a multidimensional extension of the Epigenetic Pacemaker, the Multi-state Epigenetic Pacemaker (MSEPM). We show that the MSEPM is capable of accurately modeling multiple methylation-associated factors simultaneously, while also providing site-specific models that describe the per site relationship between methylation and these factors. We utilized the MSEPM with a large aggregate cohort of blood methylation data to construct models of the effects of age-, sex-, and cell-type heterogeneity on DNA methylation. We found that these models capture a large faction of the variability at thousands of DNA methylation sites. Moreover, this approach allows us to identify sites that are primarily affected by aging and no other factors. An analysis of these sites reveals that those that lose methylation over time are enriched for CTCF transcription factor chip peaks, while those that gain methylation over time are associated with bivalent promoters of genes that are not expressed in blood. These observations suggest mechanisms that underlie age-associated methylation changes and suggest that age-associated increases in methylation may not have strong functional consequences on cell states. In conclusion, the MSEPM is capable of accurately modeling multiple methylation-associated factors, and the models produced can illuminate site-specific combinations of factors that affect methylation dynamics. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209128877,CTCF; CpG site

A first-in-class therapy, bempedoic acid inhibits the adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. In the multinational phase III CLEAR Outcomes trial in statin-intolerant patients, once-daily bempedoic acid 180 mg significantly reduced the risk of the primary endpoint (a four-component major adverse CV event composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization) compared with placebo. Bempedoic acid was generally well tolerated and, unlike statins, was associated with a low incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events (AEs). In conclusion, bempedoic acid as a monotherapy or adjunctive to other lipid-lowering therapies expands the treatment options available for the pharmacological reduction of CV risk in statin-intolerant patients, supporting achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets required for CV risk reduction. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217518206,Clinical endpoint; Ezetimibe; Stroke

The appropriate dose of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) – either standard or reduced dose – must be chosen individually in accordance with defined patient characteristics. However, a significant proportion of patients receive inappropriately low DOAC doses (underdosing). With a novel medication-based approach, this study aims to facilitate the identification of patients at risk of DOAC underdosing. Methods: The prospective ARENA registry is a multi-centre study on patients with atrial fibrillation in Germany. Patients gave detailed information on medication, including over-the-counter preparations. Medication data were grouped according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification. In a bivariate analysis, the characteristics of patients on an appropriate versus inappropriate dose were compared (n = 866). To further evaluate variables for their association with underdosing, a model based on ATC third level medication data complemented with dose-adjustment criteria and validated clinical scores in all patients with complete information was built (n = 504). Results: In 15% of patients, an inappropriately low dose was found. The number of DOAC drug interactions, concomitant antiplatelet therapy and the total drug count were the most important predictors of DOAC underdosing. Mineral supplements and better health-related quality of life (HrQoL) were predictive of correct DOAC dosing, among others. Conclusions: Medication-related data showed to be predictive of DOAC underdosing. Clinicians should check for inappropriately reduced DOAC doses, especially in patients undergoing antiplatelet therapy, polypharmacy and reduced HrQoL.

We sought to investigate this relationship, specifically examining if metformin use affects diabetic retinopathy risk in a dose-dependent manner. Methods: This study was a secondary data analysis based on a nationwide population database in Taiwan. Patients with new-onset DM, an age of 20 years or older, and a diagnosis of type 2 DM received at any time during 2002–2013 were included in the study. Patients diagnosed with new-onset type 2 DM between 2002 and 2013 were enrolled as the study population. We divided them into two groups: those treated with metformin and those treated with sulfonylureas. A Cox proportional hazards model was employed to estimate the risk of diabetic retinopathy after 5 years of follow-up, including cumulative defined daily dose and intensity of metformin treatment. Results: A total of 241,231 patients received treatment with metformin, while 152,617 patients were treated with sulfonylureas. Compared with patients treated with sulfonylureas, patients who received metformin treatment, at a cumulative defined daily dose < 30, had a lower risk of diabetic retinopathy (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.77; 95% confidence interval 0.60–0.98). However, those with varying defined daily doses, especially at a higher metformin treatment level (> 25 defined daily dose), had a 2.43 times higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (95% confidence interval 1.37–4.30) compared with patients treated with sulfonylureas. Conclusions: Patients with DM treated with a lower cumulative dosage of metformin showed beneficial effects that were associated with a lower risk of diabetic retinopathy. In contrast, a higher intensity of metformin use had a greater risk of diabetic retinopathy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217823615,Pharmacotherapy

Since IL-1 has been shown to play a key role in the etiology of different autoinflammatory diseases, blocking its pathway has become an important therapeutic target, even in neonates. Aims: We aimed to report our experience in using anakinra to treat specific neonatal inflammatory conditions. Methods: We described the clinical management with anakinra of five cases of neonates or infants up to 3 months of age admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital IRCCS in Rome (Italy) from 2020 onwards. Medical history and clinical data concerning NICU hospitalization were collected from the electronic medical records. Furthermore, we performed a literature review of off-label anakinra in the first 3 months of life, up to 5 April 2024. We excluded from this review cases of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and mevalonate kinase deficiency, for which anakinra is a known treatment. Results: We reported three off-label cardiorespiratory reasons to use IL-1Ra from our series: (i) chronic lung disease with pulmonary hypertension, (ii) interstitial lung disease with pulmonary hypertension to facilitate the weaning from respiratory support, and (iii) post-surgical polyserositis if effusions accumulate despite drainage. In all our patients, the drug was administered at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day. The route of administration was chosen based on the patient's clinical characteristics, with the subcutaneous and intravenous routes being comparable in efficacy. The duration of therapy was modulated based on the patient's clinical response, with a minimum duration of 4 months. A total of 308 retrieved articles were screened, and then full texts of records deemed eligible for inclusion were assessed. Based on the literature search and our five cases, a total of 17 infants were treated with anakinra outside its approved indications. The major off-label use was for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome, followed by multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and Kawasaki disease, as in two of our cases. Conclusions: According to the results of our case series and review of the literature, the off-label use of anakinra in neonates with inflammatory conditions refractory to first-line therapy could be considered. Prospective, multicenter research is necessary to determine whether anakinra is a safe treatment option for these infants to prevent early inflammatory illnesses and in which situations it could enhance clinical results. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217162355,Discontinuation

This study aimed to investigate the possible beneficial cardioprotective effect of Nigella sativa in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Methods: Sixty children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes were randomized into two groups: group I (n = 30) who received Nigella sativa seed oil 450 mg twice daily after meals for 3 months in addition to insulin, and group II (n = 30) who received insulin alone. Echocardiographic examinations were performed before and after the treatment. The lipid profile, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, and troponin I were also measured before and after Nigella sativa treatment. Results: After 3 months of Nigella sativa administration, group I had significantly lower cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, and troponin I levels compared with their pretreatment levels and compared with group II. In addition, group I had a significantly higher left ventricular E′/A′ ratio and two-dimensional left ventricular global longitudinal strain (2D-LV GLS) compared with baseline values and compared with group II after treatment.

Objective: We aimed to investigate incident reports involving high-alert medications to describe medication errors, error chains and stages of the medication management and use process where the errors occur in paediatric hospitals. Methods: A retrospective document analysis of self-reported medication safety incidents in a paediatric university hospital in 2018–20. The incident reports involving high-alert medications were investigated using an inductive qualitative content analysis and quantified (frequencies and percentages). A systems approach to medication risk management based on the Theory of Human Error was applied. Results: Altogether, 560 medication errors were identified within the study sample (n = 426 incident reports). Most medication errors were associated with administration (43.1 %, n = 241/560) and prescribing (25.2 %, n = 141/560). Error chains involving two to four medication errors in one or more stages of the medication management and use process were present in 26.1% (n = 111/426) of reports, most of which originated from prescribing (62.2%; n = 69/111). The medication errors (n = 560) were classified into 14 main categories, the most common of which were wrong dose (13.9%; n = 78/560), omission of a drug (12.9%; n = 72/560) and documentation errors (10.0%; n = 56). Conclusions: Paediatric medication error chains often start from prescribing and pass through the medication management and use process. Systemic defences are especially needed for manual tasks leading to wrong doses, drug omission and documentation errors. Intravenous medications and chemotherapeutic agents, optimising drug formularies and handling, and high-alert drug use at home require further actions in paediatric medication risk management. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211804009,Medication error

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of vildagliptin XR in patients with type 2 diabetes in real-world clinical settings. Methods: This was an observational, prospective, multicenter, cohort study conducted in India, which included patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin XR monotherapy with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 7.00%. Vildagliptin XR was added to their ongoing treatment. The primary endpoint was a change in HbA1c from baseline to 3 months. Secondary endpoints were changes in fasting plasma glucose, postprandial plasma glucose, percentage of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.00% at 3 months, and assessment of efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Results: A total of 1691 patients from 118 centers were enrolled in this study, having a mean (standard deviation) age of 53.10 (11) years and a mean (standard deviation) HbA1c of 8.44 (1.35) %. At the end of the study, vildagliptin XR significantly reduced the mean HbA1c by 1.02% points (95% confidence interval 0.93–1.12; p < 0.001) from baseline. The mean fasting plasma glucose and postprandial plasma glucose levels were significantly reduced by 28.44 mg/dL (95% confidence interval 26.64–30.25; p < 0.001) and 48.45 mg/dL (95% confidence interval 45.91–50.99; p < 0.001), respectively, with vildagliptin XR, at the end of study. During the study duration, 34.7% of patients achieved their glycemic target (HbA1c < 7.0%) and there were three reported adverse events (all mild in severity). Conclusions: Results demonstrated that vildagliptin XR (100 mg once daily) significantly improved HbA1c and other glycemic parameters in Indian patients with type 2 diabetes and was well tolerated.

However, the immunization rates for the influenza vaccine among this population in the Czech Republic are very low. Objective: This survey, among adults with NCDs in the Czech Republic, assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and gaps toward vaccination in general and influenza vaccination in particular. Methods: The survey was conducted between February 2023 and March 2023 among patients with NCDs in the Czech Republic. A structured web-based questionnaire with open-ended questions was administered. This study is a preplanned subgroup ancillary analysis of a previous multicentric study conducted on 1106 patients. Results: In all, 120 patients were enrolled, with 62% (74) aged between 41 and 60 years. Approximately 30% (36) had taken the influenza vaccine in the last 2 years and 70% (84) had not. Of the total sample, only 46% (55) had a positive opinion about influenza vaccines; this increased to 91% (33) among those vaccinated against the influenza virus. The main drivers of influenza vaccination were general physician (GP) recommendation [50% (18)] and patient initiative [47% (17)]. The main barriers to the influenza vaccine were lack of belief regarding its need [52% (44)], experience of mild severity of influenza [30% (25)], and lack of GP recommendation [25% (21)]. Physicians, dedicated websites, and family members are the most common sources of information regarding influenza. Even among those vaccinated for influenza, only 17% (6) had information about the risk of not taking the vaccine. A high level of dissatisfaction with the information was found among patients not vaccinated against influenza. People wanted more information on who should not receive the influenza vaccination. Unvaccinated patients sought information on side effects and efficacy. Only 40% (48) of the respondents said that they are likely/extremely likely to take an influenza vaccination in the future. Conclusions: Healthcare practitioners are the key influencers for people to get vaccinated. The dissemination of information about the importance of influenza vaccines for people with NCDs needs to be increased in the Czech Republic. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001701727,Questionnaire

While sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown cardiovascular benefits in trials, they are not included in Thailand’s National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), and their value-for-money remains unassessed. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the cost-utility of adding SGLT2i to the standard treatment for T2D-HF patients in Thailand. Methods: A Markov model with 3-month cycles and a lifetime horizon was conducted from a societal perspective. Efficacy data came from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Transition probabilities and direct medical costs were derived from the National Health Security Office database, while direct non-medical costs and utility were collected through patient interviews at Siriraj hospital to reflect Thailand’s context. The main outcomes were incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A sensitivity and budget impact analysis were also performed. Results: Canagliflozin led to the highest increase in QALYs, at 1.21 years, followed by dapagliflozin (0.54 years) and empagliflozin (0.06 years). Collectively, SGLT2i yielded an increase of 0.41 QALYs. Canagliflozin incurred the highest additional treatment cost at United States dollars (US$)5600, followed by dapagliflozin (US$3547) and empagliflozin (US$2694). The ICERs for canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and overall SGLT2i were US$4632, US$6430, US$48,952, and US$8480 per QALY gained, respectively. SGLT2i were not cost-effective compared with Thailand’s willingness-to-pay threshold of US$4564 per QALY gained. However, threshold analysis indicates that the costs of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and overall SGLT-2i should be reduced by 2.3%, 38.2%, 90.2%, and 55.6%, respectively, to be cost-effective. Budget impact analysis revealed that the total budget for treating T2D patients with HF over 5 years is US$15.6 million. Conclusions: Adding SGLT2i to standard treatment reduced HF hospitalization and mortality rates and improved QALYs in T2D-HF patients. Nevertheless, they would not be cost-effective at current prices in Thailand. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204621069,National database

Widespread non-practice of injection-site rotation and frequent reuse of insulin pen needles (PN) promote high rates of lipohypertrophy (LH) among people living with diabetes (PwD). LH is associated with increased insulin requirement and suboptimal insulin absorption leading to worsened glycemic control and increased risk for hypoglycemia. Avoiding out-of-the-pocket patient costs of PN could reduce PN reuse, thereby limiting its contribution to LH occurrence. Objectives: A model was developed to compute the impact of a behavior shift in reuse on clinical and economic outcomes for type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes populations in Belgium. Methods: Patient populations were characterized by treatment-specific characteristics and grouped by their frequency of PN replacement. The intervention was modelled to cause a change in reuse frequency, with the effects propagating downstream of the model. Model and input parameters were based on literature research and expert opinions from a Delphi panel, since available data was found to be limited, incomplete or inconsistent and assumptions were needed. Results: Using the current situation as comparator, this analysis showed a reduction of healthcare expenditures following an improvement in IIT. Considering a 5-year time horizon, this study yields potential savings of 52.6 million euros (28.1–77.9 million euros) when 55% of PwD improve PN reuse behavior. Conclusion: Our model shows that even in an era of technological advances and established diabetes care, lack of adherence to correct IIT has an important impact on economic and health outcomes of PwD in Belgium. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217174943,Delphi Method; Euros

Methods: The Betriebskrankenkasse (BKKs) Database was used to identify patients with SCD or TDT. To be eligible for inclusion, patients with SCD were required to have ≥ 2 VOCs/year in any two consecutive years and ≥ 12 months of available data before and after the index date (second VOC in the second consecutive year). Patients with TDT were required to have ≥ 8 red blood cell transfusions (RBCTs) in any 12-month period and ≥ 12 months of available data after the index date (first RBCT). Clinical and HCRU outcomes were analyzed during follow-up. Results: Overall, 84 patients with SCD with recurrent VOCs and 68 patients with TDT were identified in the BKKs database. Among patients with SCD with recurrent VOCs, the most prevalent complications were retinopathy (45.2%), multisystem organ disease/failure (40.5%), and mental health complications (31.0%); among patients with TDT, they were endocrine (69.1%) and cardiopulmonary (55.9%) complications and malignancies (44.1%). Patients with SCD experienced a mean of 4.0 (standard deviation [SD] 3.9) VOCs and 1.9 (SD 2.5) hospitalizations per patient per year (PPPY) during follow-up. Patients with TDT had a mean (SD) of 16.4 (11.2) RBCTs and 59.4 (40.8) outpatient visits PPPY. Conclusions: Patients with SCD with recurrent VOCs or TDT in Germany experience significant clinical complications and HCRU. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214008792,Hemoglobinopathy; Medical record; Vaso-occlusive crisis

However, the magnitude of triglyceride lowering with currently available therapies is modest and the impact of triglyceride-lowering on atherosclerosis remains undefined. Olezarsen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting mRNA for apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III), an inhibitor of triglyceride clearance. Methods: The Essence–TIMI 73b trial (NCT05610280) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of olezarsen 50 mg or 80 mg every 4 weeks compared with placebo. The trial enrolled adults with either moderate hypertriglyceridemia (200-499 mg/dL) plus increased cardiovascular risk, or severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL). The primary endpoint is the percent change in triglyceride levels from baseline to 6 months, reported as the difference between each olezarsen dose group and pooled placebo. A coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) substudy will examine changes in noncalcified plaque volume from baseline to 12 months. Results: A total of 1,478 patients were randomized at 160 sites in North America and Europe. The median age is 63 (IQR 56-69) years, 39% are women, and 71% are non-Hispanic White. Overall, 60% of patients have diabetes, and 42% have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. At randomization, 97% were receiving lipid-lowering therapies, including 82% on a statin. The median baseline triglyceride level was 249 (195-339) mg/dL and 9% of patients had triglycerides ≥500 mg/dL at enrollment. Approximately 1000 patients completed a baseline CTA, of whom 555 (55%) had measurable noncalcified coronary plaque and continued in the substudy. Discussion: Targeting apoC-III to facilitate clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is a potential therapeutic strategy for lowering triglyceride levels, regressing atherosclerosis, and reducing cardiovascular risk. The phase 3 Essence–TIMI 73b trial, which has enrolled nearly 1,500 patients, including over 550 in a coronary CTA substudy, should provide key insights into the efficacy and safety of olezarsen in patients with largely moderate hypertriglyceridemia and elevated cardiovascular risk.

Design: Retrospective clinical cohort study. Methods: The University of California Health Data Warehouse was queried for patients exposed to GLP-1R agonists or other oral antidiabetics. A total of 1247 glaucoma surgery and treatment naïve eyes of 626 patientson GLP-1R agonists and 1083 glaucoma surgery and treatment naïve eyes of 547 patients on other oral antidiabetics were included. Index date was defined as the date of first exposure to the medication. Eyes with at least one pre-exposure and one post-exposure tonometry records within 365 days of the index date were included. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted. Eyes were excluded upon exposure to glaucoma hypotensive medication or glaucoma surgery. The primary outcome measure was ∆IOP after exposure, which was analyzed using a paired t test and generalized estimating equations (GEE) Results: The median age was 66.2 years [IQR = 18.3]; 607 (51.7%) were female, and 667 (56.9%) were Caucasian. Median pre-exposure IOP, hemoglobin A1c, and body mass index were 15.2 mm Hg [IQR = 3.8], 7.5 [IQR = 2.4], and 29.8 [IQR = 9.4], respectively. A total of 776 individuals (66.1%) had diabetes, with the median number of active oral antidiabetics being 1.0 [IQR = 1.0], and 441 (37.5%) being insulin users. Several pre-exposure characteristics differed between the groups. The mean ∆IOP was –0.4 ± 2.8 mm Hg (paired t test P < .001) and –0.2 ± 3.3 mm Hg (paired t test P = .297) in the GLP-1R agonist and other antidiabetics groups, respectively. Pre-exposure IOP was the only independent predictor of ΔIOP in multivariable GEE. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Conclusions: Although GLP-1R agonists were significantly associated with a decrease in IOP in the paired analysis, they were not associated with ΔIOP in multivariable GEE. Moreover, the difference in ΔIOP between the two groups was small. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204915742,Association (psychology)

Design: Retrospective, comparative, interventional study. Subjects, Participants, and/or Controls: Consecutive patients with type 1 or II diabetes diagnosed with new onset VH secondary to PDR who underwent PPV at Moorfields Eye Hospital between December 2014 and December 2016. Exclusions were prior vitrectomy, iris neovascularization, neovascular glaucoma, macular edema, or presence of tractional/rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Methods, Intervention, or Testing: Patients were divided into two groups based on the timing of their surgery: early PPV (≤6 weeks) and delayed PPV (>6 weeks). Demographic and clinical features, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), expressed in logMAR at baseline and 12 months were collected. Statistical analyses, including propensity score matching, were performed using Python 3.10, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and GraphPad Prism 10. Main Outcome Measures: BCVA at 12 months postoperatively, reoperation rates, and severity of complications. Results: A total of 178 eyes were analyzed (48 early PPV, 130 delayed PPV). The mean (SD) number of weeks before surgery was 3.36 (SD 1.6) for the early PPV group and 22.56 (SD 17.23) for the delayed PPV group (P < .0001). Baseline BCVA prior to PPV was similar between groups (P = .08). At 12 months, the early PPV group had significantly better BCVA (0.40 logMAR vs 0.67 logMAR; P = .02). Patients without evidence of posterior vitreous detachment on ultrasound or OCT showed more pronounced differences (0.3 logMAR vs 0.7 logMAR; P = .001). The early PPV group had fewer sight-threatening complications (P = .005). Multivariable logistic regression identified initial BCVA, early PPV, and absence of preoperative panretinal photocoagulation as significant predictors of better visual outcomes. Conclusions: Early PPV significantly improves visual outcomes and reduces severe complications in patients with VH secondary to PDR. These findings support the benefits of early surgical intervention to enhance long-term visual prognosis in these patients. However, a randomized clinical trial is warranted. © 2024 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210133459,Vitreous hemorrhage

Given the debilitating sequelae of NAION and rapid increase of GLP-1RA use, further research is essential to investigate this potential relationship. This study seeks to determine the risk of NAION and ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) in patients prescribed GLP-1RAs. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study. SETTING: TriNetX United States collaborative network. PARTICIPANTS: Patients ≥12 years old with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and considered overweight or obese (high BMI), with at least one ophthalmology or neurology visit. Among T2DM patients, approximately 120,000 patients with a semaglutide prescription and 220,000 prescribed any GLP-1RA were compared to matched T2DM controls. Among high BMI patients, approximately 58,000 on semaglutide and 66,000 on any GLP-1RA were compared to matched controls. METHODS: Patients prescribed semaglutide or any GLP-1RA were compared with those on non-GLP-1RA medications. Populations were propensity matched (1:1) on various demographic and risk factors to balance baseline cohorts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative incidence and risk of NAION and ION. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported, with significance defined as CI <0.9 or > 1.1. RESULTS: In T2DM patients prescribed semaglutide, the risk of NAION (RR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.523-0.937) and ION (RR = 0.788, 95% CI: 0.609-1.102) after 5 years was not significantly increased compared to matched T2DM controls. Similarly, T2DM patients on any GLP-1RA demonstrated no significant difference in the risk of NAION (RR = 0.887, 95% CI: 0.735-1.071) or ION (RR = 0.969, 95% CI: 0.813-1.154) compared to controls. Furthermore, no increased risk of either outcome was found in the high BMI groups prescribed semaglutide or any GLP-1RA. The cumulative 5-year risk of NAION and ION in T2DM patients on semaglutide was 0.065% and 0.08%, respectively. In those with high BMI prescribed semaglutide, the risk of NAION and ION after 2 years was 0.038% and 0.404%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant increase in risk of NAION or ION in patients taking semaglutide or GLP-1RAs compared to T2DM or high BMI controls. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000413557,Semaglutide

Design: Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of data from DRCRnet clinical trials. Subjects: 5468 participants in 17 DRCRnet DME trials (2003-2020). Methods: The racial and ethnic distribution of DRCRnet DME trial participants was compared to United States census data and DME prevalence data in the CDC's Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS). Generalized linear models were used for comparing demographics, HgbA1c, diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity, and visual acuity (VA) among racial/ethnic groups, and for determining factors associated with VA. Main Outcome Measures: Racial and ethnic distribution of DME trial participants; patient and ocular characteristics at enrollment. Results: Compared to VEHSS (64% White, 16% Black, 4% Asian, 14% Hispanic) and the 2020 U.S. census (62% White, 12% Black, 6% Asian, 19% Hispanic), White (76%) participants were over-represented, and Asians (2%) and Hispanics (12%) were under-represented (P < .001) in DME trials. HgbA1c was higher in Black and Hispanic (8.3) than in White (7.7) and Asian (7.6) participants (P < .001). More Asian (20%) and Hispanic (23%) participants had proliferative DR than White (19%) and Black (15%) participants (P < .001). Hispanic ethnicity, female gender, older age at diabetes diagnosis, and severe DR were independently associated with worse VA (all P < .05). Conclusions: Hispanic participants, while under-represented, had higher HgbA1c, more severe DR, and worse VA than other groups, emphasizing the need for diverse recruitment in DME trials. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000043743,Diabetic macular edema

Recent studies have shown that CD44 contributes to metabolic regulation. However, the effect of CD44 on adipogenesis in white adipose tissue (WAT) remains unclear. Herein, the expression of CD44 was largely increased in the inguinal and epididymal WAT of obese mice. Ablation or neutralization of CD44 inhibited adipogenesis in cultured adipocytes. CD44-deficient mice were resistant to high-fat diet–induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. RNA-sequencing, together with functional studies, revealed that reduced expression of tryptophan 5-hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) in WAT was responsible for the repressed adipogenesis in the absence of CD44. The application of 5-hydroxytryptamine, a product of TPH2, rescued the repressed adipogenesis induced by CD44 neutralization. Moreover, the inhibition of TPH2 by p-chlorophenylalanine recapitulated the beneficial phenotypes observed in CD44-deficient mice. Taken together, these data indicate that CD44 plays a pivotal role in adipogenesis in WAT. In this regard, CD44 and its downstream target TPH2 may hold great therapeutic potential for treating excessive adiposity-related metabolic disorders, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. © 2025 American Society for Investigative Pathology",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214556157,TPH2

We investigated the associations of body mass index (BMI) trajectories measured by general practitioners with incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: We used electronic healthcare data from 111,615 European-ancestry participants from UK Biobank (57.1 (SD 7.8) years, 59.6 % women) with at least three BMI measurements (median trajectory period: 14.9 [interquartile range 9.5, 20.1] years). We calculated six variables capturing different long-term aspects, including i.e. burden (long-term average, area under the curve), gain (slope) and variability (standard deviation, average of the [absolute] consecutive BMI differences). The variables were used in principal component (PC) analyses and k-means clustering. Newly-derived dimensions and subgroups were used as exposures in cox-proportional hazard models. Results: The BMI-trajectory indices were captured in two PCs reflecting BMI burden and BMI gain. The BMI-burden PC associated with higher T2D (hazard ratio [95 % confidence interval] per SD higher PC: 1.57 [1.55,1.60]) and CAD (1.17 [1.15,1.19]) risks, while weak or no associations were observed with the BMI-gain PC (T2D: 1.03 [1.01,1.05]; CAD: 1.01 [0.98,1.03]). Participants with the highest BMI burden, compared to those with lowest BMI burden without significant gain, had highest T2D (6.96 [6.41,7.55]) and CAD (1.57 [1.45,1.69]) risks. Both methods to capture BMI burden, gain and variability showed superior model fit compared to a single baseline BMI assessment. Conclusions: Long-term high BMI burden, irrespective of BMI gain, was a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218625171,Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

While calcium scores are commonly calculated from non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, patients with PAD often undergo contrast-enhanced CT scans. This study aims to explore the association between a length-adjusted calcium score (LACS) of the iliofemoral arteries, determined through pre-intervention contrast-enhanced CT, and major adverse events in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). Methods: A cohort of CLTI patients subjected to endovascular revascularization between 2005 and 2017 at a tertiary referral center were categorized into 2 groups. The complication group experienced one of the composite outcomes (reintervention, above-the-ankle amputation, and/or all-cause mortality within 1 year of the primary endovascular procedure), while control patients did not encounter this composite endpoint. Patients from the complication group were matched one-to-one with controls based on sex and Fontaine classification. LACS was calculated (Ca volume[mm3]/length[cm]) at 3 arterial segments; 1. the common iliac artery (CIA), 2. the external iliac artery and common femoral artery (EIA + CFA), and 3. the superficial femoral artery plus the popliteal artery (SFA + PA). Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between LACS in the different arterial segments and the occurrence of the composite binary outcome (complication and control) and LACS of the different segments, adjusting influences of age, sex, BMI >25, Fontaine classification, diabetes mellitus type 1 & 2, chronic kidney disease stage, and hemodialysis treatment. Results: Sixty-four CLTI patients were included in this study (complication group [n = 32], and control group [n = 32]). A significant difference (higher LACS was found for the complication group in the CIA, the SFA + PA, as well as the total trajectory. CLTI patients with high LACS in the SFA + PA or the total trajectory were more likely to suffer adverse events (SFA + PA: OR: 1.010, 95% CI: 1.000–1.020, P = 0.04; Total LACS: OR: 1.008, 95% CI: 1.000–1.017, P = 0.05). Conclusions: Patients with a high calcium load in the ilio-femoral arteries are at increased risk of major adverse events during 1 year after endovascular revascularization. The calcium score, derived from contrast-enhanced CT scans, holds potential utility in decision making for CLTI patients. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212320227,Vascular surgery

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 12,165 patients who underwent coronary angiography, to investigate the association of the TYG and FIB-4 indices with the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or all-cause death (major cardiovascular events [MACE]), using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The mean age of the study population was 65 ± 10 years; 63% presented with acute coronary syndrome. During a median follow-up period of 6.1 years, the first MACE occurred in 4174 patients. Compared to the TYG index ≤ 50th percentile (≤ 8.81), the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for MACE was 1.17 (1.10-1.45), 1.32 (1.23-1.43), and 1.72 (1.55-1.99) for TYG index levels ≥ 50th (> 8.81), ≥ 75th (> 9.23), and ≥ 90th (9.66) percentiles, respectively. FIB-4 index levels of 1.3-2.67 and > 2.67 were associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.19 (1.11-1.27) and 1.67 (1.51-1.87), respectively, compared to FIB-4 index levels of < 1.3. Regarding the risk of developing MACE, no significant interaction was detected between TYG or FIB-4 index levels and the presence of diabetes or obesity. In a combined model of both predictive measures, a gradual increase in the incidence rate of MACE was observed, ranging from 3.93 (TYG index ≤ 8.81; FIB-4 index < 1.3) to 8.56 (TYG index > 9.23; FIB-4 index > 2.67) events per 100 patient-years. Conclusions: The TYG and FIB-4 indices, both individually and when concomitantly elevated, were independently associated with an increased risk of developing MACE in patients undergoing coronary angiography.,.

This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2018 to explore the association between VOC exposure and CKD in 1159 hypertensive adults (representing 33.6 million people). Sixteen urinary metabolites of VOC exposure (mVOCs) were analyzed with multiple statistical methods like logistic regression and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, alongside machine learning approaches. Results showed that higher levels of certain mVOCs were linked to increased CKD risk, with logistic regression indicating a significant association (e.g., odds ratio [OR] for the mVOC HMPMA (Q4) = 3.52, 95 % CI = 1.66−7.45, P = 0.001). WQS models confirmed this association in males (OR = 1.77, 95 % CI: 1.05−2.99; P = 0.033) and highlighted HMPMA (from the VOC crotonaldehyde) and PGA (from the VOC ethylbenzene) as key contributors with other models. Further analysis using network toxicology, a method to study chemical-biological interactions, identified related targets such as CCL22 and Casp3, with molecular docking confirming that HMPMA and PGA interact with these proteins. This study reveals a significant link between VOC exposure and CKD risk in hypertensive individuals, though only 2 mVOCs (HMPMA and PGA) were analyzed in downstream toxicological studies at the molecular level, suggesting a need for broader research to confirm causality. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007508432,Identification; Omics
Li M.; Brooker C.; Ambike R.; Gao Z.; Thornton P.; Do T.; Tronci G.,"Photodynamic, UV-curable and fibre-forming polyvinyl alcohol derivative with broad processability and staining-free antibacterial capability",2025,European Polymer Journal,10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2025.113794,"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) is a promising antibiotic-free strategy for broad-spectrum infection control in chronic wounds, minimising bacterial resistance risks. However, rapid photosensitiser diffusion, tissue staining, side toxicity, and short-lived antimicrobial effects present significant clinical limitations for integrating APDT into wound dressings. To address these challenges, we present the design of a bespoke polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) derivative conjugated with both phenothiazine and methacrylate functionalities, enabling staining-free antibacterial photodynamic effects, cellular tolerability and processability into various wound dressing formats, including films, textile fibres and nanoscale coatings. Tosylation of PVA is leveraged for the covalent coupling of toluidine blue ([TB]: 0.69 ± 0.03–0.81 ± 0.05 mg per gram of polymer), as confirmed by UV–Vis spectroscopy and the minimal average release of TB (≤ 3 wt%, < 0.4 µg) following 96-hour incubation in vitro. UV-induced network formation is demonstrated by complete solution gelation, rheology, and a high gel content (Ḡ > 95 wt%), and exploited to accomplish cast films and nanoscale integrated wound dressing coatings. UV curing is also successfully coupled with an in-house wet spinning process to realise individual, water-insoluble fibres as the building blocks of fibrous wound dressings. A fluorometric assay supports the generation of reactive oxygen species when the UV-cured samples are exposed to work, but not UV, light, yielding a mean log10 reduction of up to 2.13 in S. aureus, and the complete eradication of P. aeruginosa. Direct and extract cytotoxicity tests with UV-cured films and fibres demonstrate the viability of L929 fibroblasts following 60-min light irradiation and 72-hour cell culture. The bespoke molecular architecture, broad processability and cellular tolerability of this PVA derivative are highly attractive aiming to integrate durable staining-free photodynamic capability in a wide range of healthcare technologies, from chronic wound dressings up to minimally invasive localised therapy. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217228998,Derivative (finance); Polyvinyl Alcohol

A recent study highlighted high contents of endogenous phospholipids in pea protein isolate (PPI) and the potential of high-pressure homogenization (HPH) to release submicron lipid structures in aqueous suspensions. These findings raised the pivotal question of the interfacial properties of this widespread ingredient, suggesting a competition between proteins and phospholipids for interfacial adsorption. Dilatational interfacial rheology measurements were conducted using either the soluble fraction of the ingredient as such, lipids extracted from PPI, or purified pea proteins (7S). Oscillatory deformations of the oil-water interfacial layers were analyzed using Lissajous plots, which substantiated the interactions between proteins and lipids by deciphering their respective contributions. The formation of mixed interfacial films according to the protein-to-lipid ratio was demonstrated, with a prevalent influence of pea lipids on the rheological signature of the films. Atomic force microscopy confirmed the formation of mixed interfacial films where lipid domains coexist with protein aggregates. These insights advance the current knowledge regarding the complexity and functionality of plant protein ingredients, which is important to promote the rational formulation of plant-based food products. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003774251,Pea protein; Protein isolate

Methods 935 patients, admitted to the cardiovascular surgery intensive care unit between 2023.3.1 and 2023.12.31, were enrolled into this study. They were divided into the training set and the internal validation set at a ratio of 7:3. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) cox regression analysis was used to detect potential risk factors for POD and multivariable cox regression analysis was then conducted to construct the final nomogram model in the training set. Finally, we assessed the nomogram performance in terms of discrimination and calibration, including area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) both in the training set and the internal validation set. Results 108 (16.34 %)patients in the training group and 47 (16.51 %) patients in the validation group developed POD respectively. Four independent risk factors were integrated into the nomogram including postoperative AKI, hypoalbuminemia, PSQI and CPOT score. The nomogram showed a good discrimination efficacy with an AUC of 0.882 (95 % CI: 0.843–0.922) and 0.921 (95 % CI: 0.871–0.972) in the training and internal validation set respectively. Both calibration curve and DCA demonstrated that this nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusions The nomogram based on four clinically available factors has good ability to identify POD risk in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. This tool may help physicians to prevent the appearance of delirium in advance using various methods and improve prognosis.

It has not been fully elucidated how EN and its timing are correlated with treatment outcomes compared with the drainage-based approach. Methods: Within a multi-institutional cohort of 423 patients with pancreatic fluid collections, including 227 patients with WON, 153 patients were identified who received the step-up treatment after the initial EUS-guided drainage of symptomatic WON; this included 102 EN patients and 51 non-EN (drainage) patients. Using the competing-risks multivariable proportional hazards regression model with adjustment for potential confounders, we calculated subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) for clinical treatment success (WON resolution) according to use of EN and its timing. Results: Compared with drainage alone, the EN-based treatment was associated with a shorter time to clinical success with a multivariable SHR of 1.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.46). Despite a higher risk of procedure-related bleeding in the EN group, there were no differences in the rates of severe adverse events (7.8% vs 5.9% in the EN and non-EN groups, respectively) or mortality (6.9% vs 9.8%). In the EN-treated patients, the timing of EN was not statistically significantly associated with the time to clinical success (Ptrend = .34). Conclusions: Among patients receiving EUS-guided treatment of symptomatic WON, the use of EN in addition to drainage procedures was associated with earlier disease resolution. Further research is desired to determine the optimal timing of initiating EN considering a risk–benefit balance and cost-effectiveness. © 2025 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215585113,Endoscopic Ultrasound

To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first study reporting a NSAID-based complex achieved through MWAS. The coordination compound was characterised by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, and ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry. Additionally, the crystal structure of the copper metal complex was elucidated using single-crystal X-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. The compound's interaction with the biomolecules bovine serum albumin (BSA) and calf-thymus DNA (CT-DNA), was assessed through UV–Vis, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Our findings demonstrate that the metal complex effectively binds to BSA, causing a reduction in its intrinsic fluorescence and α-helical content, and shows a capacity for intercalation between CT-DNA base pairs. Finally, the copper compound exhibited promising in vitro antitumoral activities against human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), as evaluated by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay (although a similar cytotoxic effect against a non-tumoral epithelial cancer cell line, MCF-12A, was found), and increased oxidative stress levels as assessed by the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay and by evaluating glutathione levels. The results suggest that the metal complex promotes lipid peroxidation by increasing oxidative stress levels, leading to a reduction in viability of the two breast cancer cell lines. © 2024",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212555998,Cancer Therapy; Characterization; Ibuprofen

Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients treated for HCC from 1 February 2011 to 29 February 2024 at Groote Schuur Hospital, South Africa was performed. Results: Of the 501 HCC patients, 75 (15.0 %) were people living with HIV (PLWH). The PLWH were younger (43.7 ± 9.7 vs. 52.9 ± 15.3 years, p < 0.00001), had more frequent chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection (85.3 % vs. 51.6 %, p < 0.00001) and no hepatitis C virus co-infection (0 % vs. 6.8 %, p = 0.013). More PLWH presented with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage D disease (43.6 % vs. 27.7 %, p = 0.007). Similar proportions of PLWH and HIV-negative patients received curative-intended treatments, life-prolonging therapies and best supportive care.

We present the results of three axis embolization of celiac axis (CA) before DP-CAR. Methods: A prospectively maintained single-institution database was queried for patients operated on for potentially resectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) invading the CA. Results: From 2008 to 2023, DP-CAR was considered in 27 patients with distal LAPC. All 27 patients had received neoadjuvant treatment (NAT), including 7 who had no resection because of tumor progression and 20 patients who had DP-CAR; 19 had pre-operative three-axis embolization after laparoscopic exploration (LE), and one patient needed arterial reconstruction. There was one death from hepatic ischemia, but no patients had gastric ischemia, with 7 of patients suffering from 90-day severe morbidity. R0 resection was achieved in 16 patients and 13 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. With 74 months of median follow-up, median disease-free survival was 36 months. Median overall survival was 52 for patients who underwent DP-CAR. Conclusions: DP-CAR for LAPC is associated with high morbidity. However, NAT and LE may prevent unnecessary surgery for patients with progressive disease.

The impact of BMI on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection, regarding postoperative complications, remains unclear. We examined the interplay between BMI and complications on recurrence-free survival (RFS) among patients undergoing HCC resection. Methods: Patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC (2000–2023) were identified from an international database. Kaplan-Meier and Cox analyses assessed the protective impact of high BMI on RFS, considering interactions with complications. Results: Among 1,588 patients (median BMI: 25.2 kg/m²; BMI > 25.0:793, BMI ≤ 25.0:795), 560 (35.3%) experienced complications. BMI > 25.0kg/m² was linked to better 5-year RFS than BMI ≤ 25.0kg/m² (50.3% vs 45.4%; p = 0.006). Patients without complications had better 5-year RFS than those with complications (51.7% vs 40.7%; p < 0.001). Among patients without complications, RFS was comparable among BMI groups (52.9% vs 50.6%; p = 0.215), but among patients with complications BMI > 25.0kg/m² was associated with better RFS (45.6% vs 34.2%; p < 0.001). Patients with complications and BMI > 25.0 kg/m² had RFS comparable to patients without complications, regardless of BMI. Multivariable analysis identified complications (HR:1.31 [1.08–1.60]; p = 0.007) as a predictor of worse RFS, while BMI > 25.0 kg/m² (HR: 0.79 [0.68–0.96]; p = 0.020) was protective. Spline analysis demonstrated recurrence risk declined with increasing BMI among patients with complications, crossing below 1 around 25.0kg/m².

Conclusion: High BMI correlated with better RFS following HCC resection among patients with complications.

ReCET has demonstrated a positive effect on glycaemia. In this study, a single ReCET procedure was combined with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) with the goal of eliminating insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). At 12 months 86% of patients remained off insulin. Here we report the longer-term efficacy and safety of ReCET combined with GLP-1RA over 24 months. Methods: This was a first-in-human study in patients with T2D on basal insulin (28-75 years of age; body mass index, 24-40 kg/m2; hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], ≤64 mmol/mol; C-peptide, ≥0.2 nmol/L). All of the patients underwent ReCET, after which insulin was discontinued and semaglutide (GLP-1RA) was initiated. The follow-up was extended to 24 months for initial responders (off insulin and HbA1c ≤58 mmol/mol at 12 months). Primary end points were number of responders (efficacy) and number of adverse events, serious adverse events, and hypoglycemic events (safety). Secondary end points included glycemic, metabolic, and cardiovascular parameters, and treatment satisfaction scores. Results: Fourteen patients underwent endoscopic ReCET. Eleven initial responders completed the 24-month follow-up, of which 1 withdrew consent after 18 months. All patients remained off insulin with adequate glycemic control. No procedure-related serious adverse events or severe hypoglycemic events were observed during 24 months of follow-up. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and liver fat percentage improved significantly compared with baseline. Conclusions: These results suggest that duodenal ReCET combined with semaglutide is durable, allowing insulin elimination up to 24 months, and appears safe. Glycemic control was maintained, and metabolic health improved during the 24-month follow-up period. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004889297,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, the instability of many constructs leads to trial-and-error approaches, and the challenge of predicting stability based solely on amino acid sequences remains unresolved, yet highly appealing. This study evaluates the stability of wild-type murine polyomavirus (MPV) VP1 capsomeres and three engineered chimeric variants using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and laboratory experiments. MD simulations, based on AlphaFold2 predictions and up-to-date all-atom force fields, accurately predicted the thermal stability and hydrophobicity of VP1-based capsomeres. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that binding energies from simulations reliably indicate thermal stability. Experiments and simulation results showed that inserts influence the stability of capsomeres differently, with larger insertions generally having a greater impact on the structures of capsomeres. This leads to increased intra-subunit distances and a higher proportion of flexible regions in the capsomere chassis. Capsomeres with less compact structures were found to have lower thermal stability. Specifically, the thermal transitional temperature (Tm) of the wild-type capsomeres was 46.9 °C, while the Tm values of the three chimeric derivatives were 42.0 °C, 38.8 °C, and 37.7 °C, reflecting a correlation between decreased thermal stability and reduced structural compactness. This research presents a robust approach for predicting the stability of novel VLP constructs based on amino acid sequences, potentially enhancing vaccine design by reducing failures, and suggests a shift towards minimal epitope insertions for improved stability. © 2024",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211164864,Capsomere; Thermal Stability

The characterization of protein aggregates is critical for understanding their role in disease progression as well as for developing therapeutic interventions. Thus, to study protein folding and aggregation, molecular crowding agents commonly being used to mimic the in vivo condition. Moreover, histological dyes such as Thioflavin T (ThT), 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS), and Congo Red (CR) are prominent amyloid-sensitive dyes, each exhibiting distinct binding and fluorescence characteristics upon binding to amyloid fibrils. In this study, we investigated the effect of macromolecular crowding agents like Ethylene glycol (EG) and Polyethylene glycol (PEG) on binding and fluorescence properties of histological dyes. Various spectroscopic techniques revealed that there was increase and shift in the fluorescence of ThT and ANS with increasing concentration and molecular weight of PEGs and EG. Additionally, CR absorbance spectra showed structural changes in the dyes upon interaction with glycols. Further, microscopy showed altered morphology of dyes in the presence of these compounds. Moreover, molecular docking studies show that both PEGs and EG interact with the dye, thereby indicating that PEGs and EG potentially modulate the binding behavior of dyes to the protein aggregates. This study reveals that amyloid-sensitive dyes show non-specific binding with crowding agents, which can significantly impact the results when the protein is used for aggregation studies and lead to false positive results as well. Therefore, this study provides insight into interaction of dye with crowding agent, which suggests taking appropriate blanks for protein aggregation studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010560395,Amyloid (mycology); Congo red; Macromolecular Crowding; Thioflavin

Monitoring RIPF progression is challenging due to the absence of early detection tools and the difficulty in distinguishing RIPF from other lung diseases using standard imaging methods. In the lungs, integrin αvβ6 is crucial in the development of RIPF, acting as a significant activator of transforming growth factor β after radiation injury. This study aimed to investigate integrin αvβ6–targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging ([64Cu]Cu-αvβ6-BP) to study RIPF development in vivo. Methods and Materials: We used a focal RIPF model (70 Gy delivered focally to a 3 mm spot in the lung) and a whole lung RIPF model (14 Gy delivered to the whole lung) in adult C57BL/6J mice. Small animal PET/computed tomography images were acquired 1 hour postinjection of 11.1 MBq of [64Cu]Cu-αvβ6-BP. Animals were imaged for 8 weeks in the focal RIPF model and 6 months in the whole lung RIPF model. Immunohistochemistry for integrin αvβ6 and trichrome staining were performed. Results: In the focal RIPF model, there was focal uptake of [64Cu]Cu-αvβ6-BP in the irradiated region at week 4 that progressively increased at weeks 6 and 8. In the whole lung RIPF model, minimal uptake of the probe was observed at 4 months post–radiation therapy, which significantly increased at months 5 and 6. Expression of integrin αvβ6 was validated histologically by immunohistochemistry in both models. Conclusions: Integrin αvβ6–targeted PET imaging using [64Cu]Cu-αvβ6-BP can serve as a useful tool to identify RIPF in vivo. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206120598,PET Imaging

We aimed to determine whether maintaining (ie, continuing) FLST plus radiation therapy (RT) for oligoprogressive lesions (m-FLST + RT) would result in progression-free survival (PFS) equal to or greater than that of second-line systemic therapy (s-SLST), either alone or with RT (s-SLST + RT). Methods and Materials: From October 2018 to February 2024, 154 patients from 7 medical centers who developed oligoprogression after FLST were enrolled and assigned to 1 of 3 groups based on post-oligoprogression treatment strategy: m-FLST + RT, s-SLST + RT, or s-SLST-only. The primary outcome was PFS, and early patterns of recurrence were noted. Results: At a median follow-up time of 8.4 months, the median PFS time was longer in the m-FLST + RT group (8.6 months) compared with the s-SLS-only group (3.1 months) (hazard ratio, 3.163; 95% CI, 2.133-4.690; P < .001) and the s-SLST + RT group (5.8 months) (hazard ratio, 2.183; 95% CI, 1.110-4.293; P = .006). Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade and postoligoprogression treatment strategy were independent prognostic factors for PFS. Stratified analysis by ALBI grade showed that m-FLST + RT resulted in significantly longer median PFS in patients with both ALBI-1 and ALBI-2 compared with s-SLST-only (P < .001). Regarding subsequent patterns of relapse, the m-FLST + RT group had a lower rate of re-enlargement of recently oligoprogressive lesions (27.6%) than the s-SLST + RT (31.8%) and s-SLST-only (50.0%) groups. It also had the lowest rate of re-enlargement of previously identified metastases that did not progress during FLST (13.8%) compared with s-SLRT + RT (27.3%) and s-SLST-only (24.4%). Conclusions: Our study suggests a potential clinical benefit of m-FLST + RT without the need for s-SLST and provides insights to optimize treatment strategies for oligoprogressive hepatocellular carcinoma. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217259407,First line therapy

Single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that the oxygen links in bcpb2− may act as hinges, allowing for extended and folded conformations of the ligand. The resulting complexes show excellent structural stability over a wide pH range. The chain polymer 1 and the 2D networks 2 and 3 are promising luminescence sensors for Cu2+ ions with ‘turn-off’ behaviour in aqueous solution. The limit of detection for 1 is as low as 6.0 nM and thus superior to other fluorescent sensors based on metal complexes. Interestingly, 1 may also be used to sensitize Tb3+ cations with ‘turn on’ performance and exhibits good anti-interference to other lanthanide cations. As a dual-sensor, it shows good recyclability and structural stability after the sensing experiments. The possible mechanism for fluorescence quenching by Cu2+ and enhancement by Tb3+ was investigated with powder diffraction, fluorescence lifetime experiments, and infrared, UV–Vis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004044434,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Nearly half of patients undergoing ablation relapse within one year. Therefore, triggered activities may not be the only cause. Inflammation is quite common in AF. In this study, we investigated the effect of PIV, an inflammatory marker, on recurrence. Methods: A total of 157 patients who underwent ablation with cryo balloon were included in the study. One-year follow-up was evaluated for causes of recurrence. Results: When the inflammatory parameters between the two groups are analyzed, CRP (5.9 [5.0–6.9] vs 9.7 [7.6–11.9], p < 0.001), NL ratio (2.8 [2.5–3.0] vs 6.4 [5.0–6.8], p < 0.001), SII2 (618.5 [557.1–679.9] vs 1798.9 [1305.8–2292.1], p < 0.001), PIV (355.9 [313.4–398.4] vs 1832 [1317.8–2347.1], p < 001) were significantly higher in the AF recurrence group.

This study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted Behavioural Activation (BA) intervention (DiaDeM) for people with depression and T2DM in two South Asian LMICs. Methods: A multicountry, individually randomised-controlled feasibility trial was conducted from March 2022 to November 2022. We recruited adults from diabetes healthcare facilities in Bangladesh and Pakistan with a diagnosis of depression and T2DM. Consenting individuals were randomised to either optimised usual care or the DiaDeM intervention, which comprised six BA sessions delivered by non-mental health facilitators over six to twelve weeks. Participants were followed up at three and six months post-randomisation. The feasibility and acceptability of recruitment and retention, intervention delivery, and data collection were assessed. A mixed-methods process evaluation was also performed to inform the main trial. Results: The DiaDeM feasibility trial successfully recruited 128 participants, with 85 % retention at six months follow-up. The majority of participants engaged with the intervention, demonstrating good adherence to the Behavioural Activation (BA) sessions. Data completeness for key outcomes, including depression severity and HbA1c levels, was high across all time points (>90 %). The process evaluation showed high acceptability of the intervention, with participants reporting increased motivation and improved management of both T2DM and depression. Discussion: Good recruitment and retention rates, completeness of data collection, and high acceptability of the intervention showed that it would be feasible to undertake a full-scale trial. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211979156,Depression

Despite the prevalence of ingestion of particles (e.g, during oral drug delivery), our understanding of corona formation within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains limited, especially for non-protein components. The hypothesis of this work is that the exposure of nanoparticles to bile components will form a “corona” structure and protein corona will represent proteomes different from the original bile fluid. Two major aspects of biomolecular corona formed in GI fluid (hereby termed “gut corona), which ultimately dictate the fate of particle-based carriers, include the composition and the surface structure of nanoparticle-corona complex. Experiments: The structure and composition of the biomolecular corona formed on model SiO2 nanoparticles within simulated and extracted bile fluids were determined using small-angle scattering, quantification assays, and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques. Findings: The formation of raspberry-like structures was identified, with bile micelles adopting ellipsoidal shapes around the nanoparticles, as opposed to a surface covered with a uniform corona (i.e., core–shell structure). Assay quantification and proteomics experiments revealed a notable increase in the ratio of protein to bile salt within the corona compared to the original bile fluid. The composition of the proteome differed between the bovine bile and the protein corona with only 34 proteins associated with the nanoparticles from the top 100 identified in bovine bile. Despite the differences in protein types identified between bovine bile and gut corona, the proportions of protein between different functional classes, such as enzymes and structural proteins, show little variation. This work elucidates the intricate interactions between nanoparticles and gut molecules, offering insights crucial for designing nanoparticle formulations for optimized oral drug delivery and understanding nanoparticle behaviour within the GI tract. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209914031,Corona (planetary geology)

The current screening criteria in Canada have extremely high sensitivity but low specificity, leading to unnecessary examinations of neonates. Moreover, a screening algorithm that reduces the burden of screening is urgently needed owing to the increase in neonatal survival after extreme premature delivery, combined with the limited number of physicians qualified to screen for ROP. This retrospective study aimed to validate and compare the accuracy of the postnatal growth and ROP (G-ROP) and Weight, Insulin-like growth factor-1, Neonatal Retinopathy of Prematurity (WINROP) models for identifying neonates at risk for developing treatment-requiring ROP in a Canadian cohort. Design: Single-center retrospective cohort study conducted in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Data from preterm infants born between 23- and 31-week gestational age or birth weight less than or equal to 1 250 grams were analyzed. A total of 1 001 infants were included in the study. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value for WINROP, and G-ROP algorithms were assessed in identifying neonates at risk of treatment-requiring ROP. Results: The WINROP algorithm yielded 95.7% sensitivity in identifying infants requiring ROP treatment compared to 100% sensitivity with the G-ROP model. Specificity for treatment-requiring ROP for WINROP was 41.7% and G-ROP was 30.4%. Conclusions: The G-ROP model was found to be more appropriate in our cohort, lending itself seamlessly to clinical care, while providing 100% sensitivity and greater specificity compared to current screening guidelines in our cohort. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219055193,Childhood blindness

Glucocorticoids are used in its treatment at high doses at frequent intervals, causing side effects that reduce the life standard of the patients. In this study, three types of nanoparticles that include chitosan (CS) and/or sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) and/or hyaluronic acid (HA) were developed by choosing hydrocortisone (HC) as a representative model drug of glucocorticoids. Formulation optimization studies were carried out by Box-Behnken experimental design, CS:TPP, CS:HA and CS:TPP:HA nanoparticles were prepared by using chitosan solution at pH 3. CS:TPP and CS:HA ratios were chosen as 2:1 and 0.5:1, stirring time and stirring rate were adjusted to 35 min and 1000 rpm, respectively. The particle sizes of CS:TPP, CS:HA and CS:TPP:HA formulations were found as 320.9 ± 25.9, 204.4 ± 10.6, 302.5 ± 28.2 nm and zeta potentials as 28.5 ± 0.611, −14.6 ± 2.01, −17.7 ± 0.305 mV, respectively. As a result of in vitro release studies, CS:TPP:HA formulation released the least HC at the end of 24 h at pH 7.4, which represents blood and healthy synovial fluid pH, higher HC release was provided in acidic pH representing inflamed tissue environment. The particle size of CS:TPP:HA nanoparticles didn't change significantly at pH 7.4, during in vitro stability studies. 6-month-stability study results showed that CS:TPP:HA was stable at 4 °C and 25° ± 60 % relative humidity, and cytotoxicity tests showed that it was noncytotoxic. To conclude, CS:TPP:HA nanoparticles are the most promising formulation among the three different nanoparticles that were suggested for rheumatoid arthritis treatment as a pH sensitive drug carrier. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008449169,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Lactate is often utilized as a biomarker for sepsis, though its performance among subgroups such as obese patients is not well characterized. Given existing data on differences in lactate metabolism at baseline between obese and nonobese patients, this may be clinically relevant in sepsis identification and prognostication. Study Objective: We sought to compare differences in initial lactate measurements and lactate utility in predicting 30-day mortality between obese and nonobese body mass index (BMI) patients with vasopressor-dependent and non-vasopressor-dependent sepsis. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of obese and nonobese patients presenting to an adult hospital ED with sepsis with organ dysfunction. Patients were separated into vasopressor-dependent or non-vasopressor-dependent groups. The primary outcomes were differences in initial lactate and utility of initial lactate in predicting 30-day all-cause mortality by employing receiver operator characteristic curves. Results: Obese patients had lower initial lactate (2.2 mmol/L) compared with nonobese patients (2.4 mmol/L) in the non-vasopressor-dependent cohort. Lactate performed poorly-to-moderately well as a biomarker for 30-day mortality between obese and nonobese patients with sepsis, with no differences between BMI groups. Conclusion: Initial lactate levels are lower in obese patients compared with nonobese patients, but are unlikely to be clinically significant. We found no difference in lactate's utility as a biomarker for prediction of 30-day all-cause mortality between obese and nonobese patients. Lactate overall maintains some utility as a predictor of sepsis mortality, though factors that contribute to lactate levels remain unclear. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009837190,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to measure the association between albumin (ALB) levels and MSI severity. Study Design, Setting, Sample: This was a retrospective cohort study including patients who were diagnosed with MSI at the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University from 2013 to 2023. Patients with unknown etiology, incomplete data, and those with psychiatric disorders and malignant tumors were excluded. Cured subjects are defined as the absence of clinical symptoms. Predictor Variable: The primary predictor variable was the ALB levels measured at the time of admission. We categorized ALB levels at admission into <30 g/L, 30-35 g/L, and >35 g/L. Main Outcome Variable(s): The outcome variables were MSI severity measured by the length of stay (LOS) and death. LOS >14 days was a prolonged length of hospital stay. Covariates: Covariates included age, sex, involved anatomical spaces, neutrophil proportion and white blood cell counts. Analyses: Statistical analysis was conducted using Pearson's χ2 test, one-way analysis of variance, independent sample t-test, multivariate logistic regression, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal–Wallis H test, Mann–Whitney U test, and the Gamma test. The P value was set at .05. Results: This study encompassed 201 patients, of whom 123 were male (61.19%) and 78 were female (38.81%). Among these, 190 subjects (94.53%) were cured. The mean LOS was 16.38 ± 18.93 days, and 81 subjects (42.63%) had a LOS exceeding 14 days. There were 11 deceased patients (5.47%). The neutrophil proportion (χ2 = 8.31; P < .01), and white blood cell count (χ2 = 11.14; P < .01) were significantly higher in deceased patients compared to those who were cured, and among the deceased patients, there was a greater percentage of patients with odontogenic infections (χ2 = 7.48; P = .02). There was no difference in ALB levels among the deceased patients (χ2 = 3.08 P = .21). A reduction in ALB levels is associated with an increased risk of prolonged LOS (χ2 = 21.77; P < .001). The relative risk (RR) of LOS extension when the ALB level is between 30 and 35 g/L is 1.32 times higher than when the ALB level exceeds 35 g/L (RR = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.99 to 1.76). Furthermore, when ALB levels fall below 30 g/L, the RR increases to 2.19 times higher compared to ALB levels greater than 35 g/L (RR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.47 to 3.26). Moreover, the LOS was used to measure the severity of MSI. Multivariate regression analysis found ALB levels were negatively associated with LOS. Subjects with ALB levels less than 30 g/L had a 2.98 times higher risk (95% CI = 1.12 to 7.75; P = .03) than subjects with ALB levels more than 35 g/L. The risk factors of MSI including the ALB levels less than 35 g/L (odds ratio (OR) (>35:30 to 35:<30) = 1.00:1.85:2.98), multiple space infections (OR (1:2-3:4-5:>5) = 1.00:0.52:1.92:5.49), and descending necrotizing mediastinitis (OR = 4.30). Conclusion and Relevance: ALB levels less than 35 g/L, multiple space infections, descending necrotizing mediastinitis occurrence, and increased LOS are risk factors for increased severity of MSI and may lead to prolonged LOS. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207321164,Association (psychology)

Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort of patients who underwent PVS after abdominal surgery between 2007 and 2021 was analyzed. Patients’ age, sex, and PVS technical success (defined by PV patency at final portography) were evaluated. Alb, prothrombin time–international ratio (PT-INR), total bilirubin (Tbili), platelet (Plt) counts, Child-Pugh scores (CPS), and Alb-bilirubin (ALBI) scores/grades before and 1 month after PVS were compared. Normally distributed variables were summarized as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared with paired t-tests. Skewed variables were summarized as median (interquartile range) and compared with the signed-rank tests. Results: Twenty-five patients (mean age, 61 years [SD ± 10]; female, 44%) were included. Technical success of PVS was achieved in all. Comparison was conducted for 28 PVS sessions: the Alb levels increased from 3.1 g/dL (SD ± 0.6) to 3.5 g/dL (SD ± 0.5) (P = .006), with greatest change in patients with pre-PVS Alb levels of ≤2.9 g/dL (2.6 g/dL ± 0.3 to 3.3 g/dL ± 0.4, P < .001). Improvements in CPS (P = .026), ALBI score (P = .002), and ALBI grades (P = .026) were observed. PT-INR elongated (1.2 [1.1–1.3] to 1.3 [1.2–1.6], P = .002), mainly because of patients receiving post-PVS warfarin (P = .005 and P = .20 for with and without warfarin, respectively). No significant changes were observed for Tbili (P = .40) and Plt counts (P = .25). Conclusions: Improvements of liver synthetic function represented by serum Alb levels and in hepatic reserve scores were observed after PVS, particularly in patients with pre-PVS hypoalbuminemia. © 2024 SIR",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217269347,Hypoalbuminemia

Symptoms of chylous leakage were not controlled after ethiodized oil lymphangiography, including patients’ weight increase, abdominal circumference increase, and serum albumin level decrease. After undergoing TIPS procedure 1 week later, chylous ascites was gradually alleviated, manifested as weight decrease, abdominal circumference decrease, and serum albumin level maintenance. In mean follow-up of 15.6 months (SD ± 11.6), all chylous ascites was relieved without recurrence.

Patients and Methods: Data on 41,361 participants who underwent health examinations between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2007, were analyzed, and the results of logistic and Cox regression analyses in the same cohort were examined. Results: Cross-sectional analyses showed that the prevalence of all three diseases increased with a positive family history, especially T2DM, with an odds ratio (OR) of 12.00 (95% CI, 7.82 to 18.41) when the number of affected relatives was greater than or equal to 3 with an OR of 20.43 (95% CI, 11.0 to 37.8) for a positive family history across three generations compared with no family history. However, redefining family history from “parents, siblings, and grandparents” to “parents and siblings” or “parents only” did not significantly change ORs for each disease. Among those with a positive family history and body mass index greater than or equal to 30.0 kg/m2 hypertension was 19 times more prevalent compared with no family history and body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2. In the longitudinal study, family history strongly influenced incident T2DM (hazard ratio[HR], 2.40; 95% CI, 1.93 to 2.98), hypertension (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.62), and dyslipidemia (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.83), respectively. Conclusion: Obtaining a family history of these diseases was useful in identifying high-risk groups. Also, for T2DM, the influence of a positive family history was strongest with a marked increase in risk with overlap of affected family members, suggesting that a family history is useful for early detection and prevention. © 2024 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218084853,Cross-sectional study; Dyslipidemia

Methods: From the prospective observational cohort study using data from the UK Biobank between March 13, 2006, and August 31, 2017, a total of 32,281 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and higher and urine albumin to creatinine ratio below 30 mg/g (cohort 1) and 3339 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or urine albumin to creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g and higher (cohort 2), all with baseline plasma FGF21 measurements, were included. The primary predictor was plasma FGF21 levels measured by proximity extension assay. The primary outcomes were incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) for cohort 1 and incident kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT) for cohort 2. Results: In cohort 1, 804 (5.6%) participants experienced the CKD outcome during a median 13.7 years of follow-up. A cause-specific competing model revealed adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs of 1.01 (0.88 to 1.17), 1.01 (0.87 to 1.17), and 1.25 (1.08 to 1.44) for Q2 to Q4 compared with Q1 (Ptrend=.002). In cohort 2, 83 (2.5%) participants had KFRT during a median 13.7 years of follow-up. Elevated FGF21 levels were similarly associated with a higher KFRT risk, with adjusted hazard ratios of 2.79 (0.97 to 8.05), 3.91 (1.44 to 10.66), and 3.81 (1.44 to 10.08) for Q2 to Q4 (Ptrend=.01). Subgroup analysis revealed stronger association in non-CKD participants with obesity and dyslipidemia, whereas for CKD participants, this association was stronger in those with increased inflammatory markers. Conclusion: Higher FGF21 levels correlated with heightened risks of adverse kidney outcomes in individuals with and without CKD. However, the metabolic abnormalities potentially influencing this association varied according to baseline kidney function. © 2024 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009698811,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

RA affects the synovial joints, the synovial lining, and the permeability of the synovium. As the latter is of central relevance for the distribution of systemically delivered therapeutics into synovial fluid (SF), we here assessed the protein composition of paired plasma and SF of patients diagnosed with RA at three distinct levels of depth using mass spectrometric approaches: the “total” proteome, the “total” immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody repertoire, and the RA-specific anticitrullinated protein IgG1 autoantibody repertoire. The SF proteome was found to be dominated in numbers and concentration by plasma proteins, although we additionally detected several cartilage- and neutrophil-derived proteins of lower abundance. Strikingly, the plasma proteins were not only qualitatively reflected in SF but also quantitatively, independent of their size and/or other biochemical features. Also, the synovial “total” IgG1 and autoreactive anticitrullinated protein antibody IgG1 repertoire highly resembled the IgG1 repertoires detected in plasma within the same patient. Our comprehensive multilayer data thus reveals that the proteome, including the dominant, most abundant (auto)antibody clones, present in SF of RA patients is a direct reflection of the proteome present in blood, spiked by the local (immune) processes within the RA joint. We thus conclude that proteins directly pass from blood into SF of these joints without substantial bias. These findings thereby not only exemplify the use of in-depth multilayer proteome analyses to revisit basic concepts underlying RA pathology and to monitor the local (immune) processes destructive to cartilage but also provide evidence indicating that (protein-based) therapeutics may equally enter SF of swollen joints and that pharmacokinetic analyses of such therapeutics in blood are directly relevant to the synovial compartment. © 2025 THE AUTHORS.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000080406,Proteome

Currently, the identification and classification of NASH require invasive liver biopsy, which has certain limitations. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics can detect crucial proteins and pathways implicated in NASH development and progression. We collected the liver and serum samples from choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet fed NASH C57BL/6J mice and human serum samples to examine proteomic alterations and identify early biomarkers for NASH diagnosis. In-depth targeted multiple reaction monitoring scanning and immunoblotting assays were used to verify the biomarker candidates from mouse liver and serum samples, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to analyze human serum samples. The multiple reaction monitoring analysis of NASH liver revealed 50 proteins with altered expression (21 upregulated and 29 downregulated) that are involved in biological processes such as detoxification, fibrosis, inflammation, and fatty acid metabolism. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified impaired protein synthesis, cellular stress and defense, cellular processes and communication, and metabolism in NASH mouse liver. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that the expression of proteins associated with fatty acid metabolism (Aldo B and Fasn) and urea cycle (Arg1, Cps1, and Otc) was altered in the mouse liver and serum. Further analysis on human serum samples using ELISA confirmed the increased expression of multiple proteins, including Aldo B, Asl, and Lgals3, demonstrating values of 0.917, 0.979, and 0.965 of area under the curve in NASH diagnosis. These findings offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of NASH and possible diagnostic biomarkers for early detection. © 2025 THE AUTHORS.",,Final,All Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001186389,Identification; Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; Proteome

AD involves isoforms, proteolytic products, and posttranslationally modified proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and microtubule-associated protein tau. Top-down proteomics directly measures these species and thus, offers a comprehensive view of pathologically relevant proteoforms that are difficult to analyze using traditional proteomic techniques. Here, we broadly explored associations between proteoforms and clinicopathological traits of AD by deploying a quantitative top-down proteomics approach across frontal cortex of 103 subjects selected from the ROS and MAP cohorts. The approach identified 1213 proteins and 11,782 proteoforms, of which 154 proteoforms had at least one significant association with a clinicopathological phenotype. One important finding included identifying Aβ C-terminal truncation state as the key property for differential association between amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Furthermore, various N-terminally truncated forms of Aβ had noticeably stronger association with amyloid plaques and global cognitive function. Additionally, we discovered six VGF neuropeptides that were positively associated with cognitive function independent of pathological burden. The database of brain cortex proteoforms provides a valuable context for functional characterization of the proteins involved in AD and other late-onset brain pathologies. © 2025 THE AUTHORS.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010574199,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In this study, we conducted a study for the development of biopharmaceuticals based on the CLCF1 protein. First, we established strategies for producing recombinant human CLCF1 protein by transient gene expression in ExpiCHO-S™ Cells and Expi293F™ Cells. For the secretion of CLCF1 protein, we established strategies that human CRLF1 or sCNTFR with CLCF1 protein were co-expressed. As a result, the CLCF1 protein formed a complex with CRLF1 or sCNTFR, which was successfully secreted. Furthermore, the productivity of CLCF1 protein was significantly increased. The ratio of co-transfected plasmids, temperature, CO2 level and time of harvest were explored, so that the productivity of CLCF1 was remarkably increased 7-fold from 3 mg/L to 22 mg/L. Next, we generated recombinant CLCF1 fusion protein with HSA (Albumin CLCF1) considering the improvement of pharmacokinetic properties and the proven production method in GMP facilities. We evaluated the biological activity of various CLCF1 proteins. In consideration of protein productivity, physical properties, and efficacy, we conducted a single intravenous administration of 4 types of proteins in Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the short-term toxicity. As a result, no toxicity related CLCF1 proteins was observed based on the behavior sign observation and body weight changes.

Analyzing diabetes medication prescribing trends among these provider types is essential for ensuring evidence-based diabetes care. Purpose: This retrospective, cross-sectional pilot study aimed to examine differences in type 2 diabetes medication prescribing trends by provider type (physicians vs. APPs) and geographic location, utilizing National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data. Methods: Data from the NAMCS were collected in August 2022 for the years 2015, 2016, 2018 and analyzed using IBM SPSS, employing chi-square analysis to assess associations between provider type, geographic location, and prescribed medications. Frequency distributions were calculated for patient characteristics and provider types. Results: Patients prescribed at least one diabetes medication (N = 1444) were included. Most received care from physicians (93.7 %) in metropolitan areas (82.8 %). Statistically significant associations were found between provider type, geographical location, and medications prescribed. Nurse practitioners were more likely to prescribe newer diabetes medications, while physician assistants frequently prescribed basal insulin. Patients in non-metropolitan statistical areas were more often prescribed older medications, whereas those in the West were less likely to receive older medications. Conclusions: The study revealed distinct prescribing patterns by provider type and geographic location. Notably, APPs tended to prescribe newer or specific medications in certain locations, highlighting the influence of provider type and geography on diabetes care. Further studies should include larger samples of APPs to deepen insights into these trends. © 2024",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212338473,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study evaluated the pharmacodynamics of EP395 in response to inhaled LPS, an established clinical model for assessing anti-inflammatory effects of potential new treatments. Forty-nine healthy, non-smoking participants were randomised to oral 375 mg EP395 or placebo, daily for 3 weeks. An inhaled LPS challenge (2 μg) was then given, followed 6 h later by bronchoscopy for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) collection. Blood samples were collected pre, 6 and 24 h after LPS challenge. BALF concentrations of IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-1α, MIP-1β and MCP-1 were lower with EP395 than placebo, while IL-33, IL-8, and IL-1β were higher with EP395 than placebo (not statistically significant). Neutrophil counts were unaffected, but neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase were higher with EP395 than placebo (not statistically significant). Serum concentrations of surfactant protein-D significantly increased in the EP395 group in response to LPS at both 6 and 24 h compared with pre-LPS (mean pre-LPS 148.8 ng/mL; mean 24 h post-LPS 183.0 ng/mL) but not in the placebo group (mean pre-LPS 142.4 ng/mL; mean 24 h post-LPS 142.4 ng/mL). The log2 transformed fold difference in the EP395 group, before and 24 h after LPS challenge was 0.33 (95 % CI 0.52, 0.14; p = 0.0007).

However, recurrence has been observed in this patient group. Therefore, this study aimed to identify recurrence and prognostic factors in patients with pathologic T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who were treated with surgery alone. Methods: Of the 532 patients who underwent esophagectomy with R0 resection at Hiroshima University Hospital between August 2003 and November 2018, 124 who underwent only esophagectomy and had pathological T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were included in the study. Recurrence and prognostic factors were analyzed and details of recurrence were evaluated. Results: The 5-year recurrence-free survival and 5-year overall survival rates were 84.7% and 87.2%, respectively. Recurrence was observed in 12 (9.7%) patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the histologic type (poorly differentiated compared with others) and lymphatic and/or vascular invasion (positive compared with negative) were statistically significant for recurrence-free survival. Kaplan–Meier curves for recurrence-free survival and overall survival showed that prognosis was significantly stratified according to these factors. All patients with poorly differentiated and positive lymphatic and/or vascular invasion experienced recurrence and recurrence pattern is all distant metastases. Conclusions: Poorly differentiated and lymphatic and/or vascular invasion are important recurrence and prognostic predictors in pathologic T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with surgery alone. Patients with these prognostic factors experienced increased recurrence rates, often with distant metastasis. Therefore, adjuvant therapy may be beneficial for such patients and follow-ups should be performed at closer intervals. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206618614,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We evaluated the efficacy of pancreas-preserving distal pancreatectomy in terms of oncologic parameters and postoperative pancreatic function. Methods: The data of 98 consecutive patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma between 2012 and 2022 in our institution were retrospectively analyzed. The surgical outcomes, overall survival, and postoperative pancreatic function were compared between pancreas-preserving distal pancreatectomy, in which the pancreatic stump was distal to the left margin of the portal vein on postoperative computed tomography, and conventional distal pancreatectomy. Results: Sixteen patients (16%) underwent pancreas-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Fewer lymph nodes were dissected in the pancreas-preserving distal pancreatectomy group than the conventional distal pancreatectomy group (19 vs 31, respectively; P < .01); however, the R0 resection rate (94% vs 93%, respectively; P = 1.00), recurrence-free survival, and overall survival were similar. Similar results were obtained in an analysis limited to patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the pancreatic tail. Patients who underwent pancreas-preserving distal pancreatectomy were less likely to develop worsening of their diabetes than those who underwent conventional distal pancreatectomy (19% vs 39%, respectively; P = .16). Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease newly developed in 22% of the patients who underwent conventional distal pancreatectomy but in none of those who underwent pancreas-preserving distal pancreatectomy (P = .04). Conclusion: The pancreatic transection site should be distally located to preserve postoperative pancreatic function when R0 resection can be achieved. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211347663,Distal pancreatectomy
Musella M.; Velotti N.; Schiavone V.; Franzese A.; D'Amato G.; Bartolini C.; Avella P.,Lesson learned from bariatric surgery: Preventing intra- and perioperative complications in patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy: Role of ketogenic preoperative diet: A propensity score matching analysis of a single-center experience,2025,Surgery (United States),10.1016/j.surg.2024.109147,"Background: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the preferred surgical approach for adrenal resection. The simultaneous presence of obesity and subsequent liver steatosis may complicate the procedure, increasing the risk of intra- and perioperative complications. This study explores the effectiveness of a preoperative very low-calorie ketogenic diet in improving surgical outcomes in patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 70 patients from January 2021 to July 2024 at the Bariatric and Endocrine-Metabolic Surgery Unit, University of Naples “Federico II.” Among these, 54 patients with a body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 were divided into 2 groups: group A, which underwent a 4-week very low-calorie ketogenic diet, and group B, which did not receive any dietary intervention. Propensity score matching was used to balance the groups for confounding factors. Furthermore, a subanalysis between groups was performed according to right and left laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Results: Group A had a significantly reduced operative time (94.59 ± 54.11 minutes) compared with group B (129.22 ± 51.06 minutes, P = .01). Additionally, group A exhibited fewer perioperative complications (P = .01). The very low-calorie ketogenic diet was also associated with a significant reduction in body mass index from 31.74 ± 1.31 kg/m2 to 29.05 ± 0.99 kg/m2 (P = .001) before surgery. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests preoperative very low-calorie ketogenic diet can significantly improve surgical outcomes in patients with obesity scheduled to adrenal glands surgery. The study supports the integration of dietary interventions into the preoperative management of patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Future research with larger sample sizes and randomized controlled trials is recommended to validate these findings and optimize preoperative care protocols. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216223222,Preoperative care; Single Center

This study aims to assess the association between perioperative immunonutrition supplementation and anastomotic leak in an elective Enhanced Recovery After Surgery colorectal surgical population. Methods: We performed a retrospective single-institution cohort study consisting of adult patients enrolled in an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery pathway and undergoing elective colorectal surgery from 2018 to 2023. Immunonutrition supplementation was defined as a 10-day perioperative supply of commercially available nutritional shakes. Relevant demographic covariates, preoperative characteristics, and operative methods were identified and analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the association of immunonutrition with anastomotic leak. Results: A total of 708 patients were included in the study, of which n = 400 (56.5%) received perioperative immunonutrition. Patients who received immunonutrition were more likely to be older (median age 57.9 vs 55.7), male (52.7% vs 44.8%), have a higher body mass index (27.7 vs 26.3), and less likely to be current smokers (9.8% vs 16.2%). On adjusted analysis, there was no association between immunonutrition use and anastomotic leak (odds ratio = 0.96, 95% confidence interval = 0.45, 2.08), 30-day readmission (odds ratio = 0.97, 95% confidence interval = 0.60, 1.57), or length of stay (β = .40, 95% confidence interval = –0.06, 0.86) Conclusion: We did not observe an association between perioperative immunonutrition supplementation and postoperative anastomotic leak, suggesting that the role of immunonutrition within a comprehensive Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program for elective colorectal surgery may warrant further evaluation. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216575280,Colorectal Surgery; Elective surgery

This study aimed to develop a clinical prediction model incorporating the C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio to determine neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy in patients with colorectal liver metastasis Methods: This retrospective study included 1,335 patients with colorectal liver metastasis who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were classified into high and low C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio groups on the basis of an optimal cutoff value. Multivariate regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between clinical factors and progression-free survival. A prediction model was constructed and validated both internally and externally. Results: The optimal C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio cutoff value was 0.234. Patients with a high C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio had a greater risk of 3-year disease progression and shorter 5-year survival (both P < .05). The final model incorporated C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio value, clinical risk score, and tumor differentiation. It demonstrated excellent performance in predicting progression-free survival (C-index = 0.69) and OS (C-index = 0.72), outperforming the clinical risk score alone in both internal and external validations. Conclusion: The C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio is an effective independent predictor for patients with colorectal liver metastasis receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The clinical prediction model exhibited superior predictive ability, potentially improving individualized treatment decisions patients with colorectal liver metastasis. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004666834,Neoadjuvant Therapy

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical and ultrasound data from 1,050 patients at 2 centers who underwent cholecystectomy for gallbladder polyps. Six machine-learning algorithms were used to develop preoperative models for predicting benign and malignant gallbladder polyps. Internal and external test cohorts evaluated model performance. The Shapley Additive Explanations algorithm was used to understand feature importance. Results: The main study cohort included 660 patients with benign polyps and 285 patients with malignant polyps, randomly divided into a 3:1 stratified training and internal test cohorts. The external test cohorts consisted of 73 benign and 32 malignant polyps. In the training cohort, the Shapley Additive Explanations algorithm, on the basis of variables selected by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression and multivariate logistic regression, further identified 6 key predictive factors: polyp size, age, fibrinogen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, presence of stones, and cholinesterase. Using these factors, 6 predictive models were developed. The random forest model outperformed others, with an area under the curve of 0.963, 0.940, and 0.958 in the training, internal, and external test cohorts, respectively. Compared with previous studies, the random forest model demonstrated excellent clinical utility and predictive performance. In addition, the Shapley Additive Explanations algorithm was used to visualize feature importance, and an online calculation platform was developed. Conclusion: The random forest model, combining preoperative ultrasound and clinical features, accurately predicts benign and malignant gallbladder polyps, offering valuable guidance for clinical decision-making. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007560181,Feature (linguistics); Lasso

We planned a study to see the impact of a structured, multidimensional prehabilitative intervention on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methodology: All consecutive patients planned for pancreaticoduodenectomy from January 2023 to June 2024 were assessed for enrollment. At least 2 weeks of semisupervised home-based prehabilitative intervention was done that included physical exercises, nutritional optimization, smoking cessation, and comorbidity optimization. Postoperative outcomes were recorded that included postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), complications grade, delayed gastric emptying, postoperative hospital stay, readmission rate, and mortality. Postoperative outcomes were compared with a historical control group of 81 patients. Results: Of the 85 patients who were assessed for inclusion, 58 patients completed the prehabilitation program and underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and were finally analyzed. The median age of the study group was 58 (interquartile range 45, 63.2), and 29 (50%) were male. Prehabilitation intervention resulted in improved weight control (median 56.5 kg [interquartile range 51.2, 67] vs 55 kg [ 49.2, 67.5], P < .001), increase in breath hold time (median 32 [interquartile range 28, 35] vs 28 [24, 33.5] seconds, P < .001), higher prognostic nutritional index (median 45.5 [interquartile range 39.5, 49.6] vs 47.8 [42.4, 50.8], P = .003), and increased gait speed (median 0.66 [interquartile range 0.58, 0.75] vs 0.54 [0.50, 0.66] m/s, P = .001). Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (18 [22.2%] vs 11 [19%], P = .64) and major complications were similar between the prehabilitation and control groups (17 [29.3%] vs 24 [29.6%], P = .96). The mortality in the control group was higher compared with that in the prehabilitation group (6.3% vs 1.7%). Conclusion: Semisupervised home-based prehabilitation is effective in improving physiological parameters and functional capacity in pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, establishing the definite role of prehabilitation in pancreaticoduodenectomy to improve postoperative outcomes needs a large randomized study. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006821397,Prehabilitation

Study Design: We developed an electronic clinical quality measure for postoperative respiratory failure on the basis of input from clinical and quality experts. Using 2022 structured electronic health record data from 12 diverse hospitals encompassing 2 common electronic health record vendors, we retrospectively evaluated criteria for postoperative respiratory failure after an operation during an elective hospitalization. We sampled all denominator-eligible cases meeting postoperative respiratory failure criteria, and a subset that did not, from each center. Trained nurse abstractors reviewed medical records using a standard instrument. We assessed the positive and negative predictive value of the measure (with 95% confidence intervals), and the discrimination and calibration of its risk model. Results: Among 95 records flagged by the measure and 310 denominator-eligible records not flagged, the postoperative respiratory failure electronic clinical quality measure numerator criteria had a positive predictive value of 88.7% (95% confidence intervals, 80.6–94.2%) and negative predictive value of 99.7% (95% confidence intervals, 98.2–100%). False-positive results frequently involved easily correctible respiratory therapist documentation errors. Risk-adjusted rates of postoperative respiratory failure across hospitals ranged from 0.0 to 16.8/1,000 hospitalizations. The risk model, which included 8 comorbidities, 6 laboratory tests, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, had a c-statistic of 0.91. Conclusion: Postoperative respiratory failure can be measured with high validity from readily available, structured electronic health record data. A postoperative respiratory failure electronic clinical quality measure would not be dependent on administrative claims data or collection by trained abstractors, offering the potential to inform quality improvement in elective perioperative care. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007165402,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study explores the clinical efficacy of using a 5-F biliary stent with automatic detachment to prevent bile leakage postbiliary exploration. Methods: This randomized controlled observational study was conducted from January 2023 to January 2025. Patients undergoing primary closure of the common bile duct in our team were randomly divided into 2 groups. The treatment group had biliary stents placed during biliary stone extraction and then primary closure, whereas the control group had direct primary closure after stone extraction. The primary outcome was bile leakage incidence. The secondary outcome measure was the rate of automatic removal of biliary stents, surgical time, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative blood test indicators, and complications. Results: Both groups included 85 patients. Preoperative data such as white blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, serum amylase, serum lipase, common bile duct diameter, and stone characteristics were comparable (P > .05). In the treatment group, stent placement took 8 (5–12) minutes. All stents were in place at 72 hours post operatively. The automatic detachment rate at 1 month was 98.93%, with 1 case removed via duodenoscopy. The bile leakage rate (1.17% vs 9.41%), surgical time (103.11 ± 10.16 minutes vs 99.89 ± 9.07 minutes), and postoperative hospital stay (4.56 ± 0.69 days vs 5.09 ± 0.84 days) were significantly different between the groups (P < .05). There were no significant differences in postoperative 48-hour blood indicators (P > .05), but total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alanine aminotransferase decreased significantly compared with preoperative levels in both groups. Conclusion: Placing a 5-F biliary stent with automatic detachment during laparoscopic common bile duct exploration for stone extraction and then performing primary closure can effectively reduce bile leakage and postoperative hospital stay. With a short placement time and high automatic detachment rate, this method is simple and worthy of promotion. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008451413,Biliary stent; White blood cell
Arushi; Bhattacharjee S.; Kumar A.; Khanna P.; Chumber S.; Kashyap L.; Maitra S.,Association between cumulative fluid balance to estimated colloid oncotic pressure ratio and postoperative outcome in surgical patients requiring intensive management,2025,Surgery (United States),10.1016/j.surg.2025.109525,"Purpose: The integrity of the capillary endothelium and the filtration pressure regulate extravascular fluid leakage. A low plasma colloid oncotic pressure can contribute to extravascular leakage, which, when associated with a positive fluid balance, might lead to postoperative complications. Methods: Cumulative fluid balance and estimated colloid oncotic pressure were noted until postoperative 72 hours in 200 adult patients undergoing major emergency requiring intensive care management. All participants were followed until hospital discharge (or death) for any postoperative complications as per Clavien-Dindo grade. The primary outcome was the association between cumulative fluid balance/estimated colloid oncotic pressure ratio at 48 hours and postoperative complications any time during the hospital stay. Results: One hundred forty-seven of the 197 patients (74.6%) developed at least 1 postoperative complication. The incidence of major postoperative complications, defined as Clavien-Dindo grade IV and V, was 28.4%. Within the follow-up period, 29 patients (14.7%) died. No independent association between the cumulative fluid balance/estimated colloid oncotic pressure ratio at 48 hours and the occurrence of any postoperative complications (P = .093) was found. However, ordinal logistic regression reported that a higher cumulative fluid balance/estimated colloid oncotic pressure ratio at 48 hours was independently associated with a higher grade of complications (P = .009). The cumulative fluid balance/estimated colloid oncotic pressure ratio at 48 hours (P = .012) was also independently associated with major postoperative complications. However, no independent association was found between cumulative fluid balance/estimated colloid oncotic pressure ratio at 48 hours and in-hospital mortality (P = .160) or hospital-free days at day 30 (P = .985). Conclusion: The cumulative fluid balance/estimated colloid oncotic pressure ratio at 48 hours was associated with increased postoperative complications, irrespective of the patient's baseline clinical status. Excessive fluid therapy should be discouraged in these patients, especially when serum proteins are low. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008824493,Oncotic pressure

Methods: Patients who underwent curative-intent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma between 2000 and 2023 were identified using a multi-institutional international database. Preoperative characteristics were assessed in relation to severe complications (defined as complications with a Clavien-Dindo classification III or greater) and very early recurrence (recurrence within 6 months after surgery) using multivariable analysis. Predictive models for severe complications and very early recurrence were developed and externally validated. Results: Among 969 patients, 97 patients (10.0%) experienced severe complications, and 116 patients (12.0%) developed very early recurrence. On multivariable analysis, American Society of Anesthesiologists class >2 and greater albumin-bilirubin score were associated with severe complications. Meanwhile, a greater albumin-bilirubin score and higher tumor burden score were associated with very early recurrence. A predictive model for very early recurrence was able to stratify patients relative to their risk for recurrence: low-risk (6-month recurrence-free survival, 94.1%), medium-risk (6-month recurrence-free survival, 86.0%), and high-risk (6-month recurrence-free survival, 67.1%). A total of 74 patients (7.6%) had an unfavorable risk profile (severe complication risk ≥30% and high-risk for very early recurrence). The discriminative accuracy of the severe complications (training: area under the curve, 0.69; external validation: area under the curve, 0.80) and very early recurrence (training: C-index: 0.65; external validation: C-index: 0.71) models were favorable (see online calculator: https://junkawashima.shinyapps.io/HCC_comp_VER/). Conclusion: An easy-to-use online calculator stratified patients relative to short- and long-term risks, identifying a subset of patients at a high risk of severe complications and very early recurrence who were unlikely to benefit from surgical resection. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009002442,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

As such, a high-risk resection may not be warranted when the oncological benefits are minimal. In the current study, we sought to develop 2 preoperative models to predict 90-day mortality and overall survival after liver resection for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Methods: Patients who underwent curative-intent liver resection for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma between 1990 and 2020 were identified from an international multi-institutional database. Two prognostic models were developed with preoperative factors using multivariable regression analysis for 90-day mortality and overall survival. Patients were categorized into 3 risk groups: favorable profile for liver resection (predicted 90-day mortality <10% and overall survival >3 years), unfavorable profile (predicted 90-day mortality >25% and/or predicted overall survival <1.5 years), and an intermediate group. Results: Among 889 patients included in the cohort, 90-day mortality was 8.5% (n = 76) and median overall survival was 24.1 months. On multivariable regression analyses, independent risk factors for both 90-day mortality and overall survival were American Society of Anesthesiologists grade >2, high tumor burden score, and receipt of neoadjuvant therapy. Additional risk factors for 90-day mortality included carbohydrate antigen 19–9 >37 U/mL; relative to overall survival, advanced age, male sex, and major hepatectomy were associated with worse long-term survival (all P < .05). In total, 168 patients (18.9%) had a favorable surgical risk profile with a 90-day mortality of 4.3% and a median overall survival of 47.0 months, 156 patients (17.5%) had an unfavorable profile with a 90-day mortality of 33.3% and a median overall survival of 11.9 months, and 565 patients (63.6%) had an intermediate profile with a 90-day mortality of 15.1% and a median overall survival of 29.9 months. The models were made available online for ease-of-use and clinical applicability (https://altaf-pawlik-icc-mortality-calculator.streamlit.app/). Conclusion: Risk models for 90-day mortality and long-term overall survival can be used to identify patients preoperatively with a high-risk surgical profile who are unlikely to benefit from liver resection. Information on surgical risk profile should be used to tailor shared decision-making within a multidisciplinary setting. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010451204,Calculator; Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma; Surgical resection

Methods: In this retrospective study, we collected clinical information from patients who underwent OLT at our institution and analyzed outcomes and potential risk factors for developing ES after OLT. Results: Fourteen of our 376 patients (3.72%) who underwent OLT had ES. After excluding 2 patients with already known epilepsy, among the other 12 patients, 2 were diagnosed with nonanoxic cerebral edema, 2 with anoxic damage, 1 with intracranial hemorrhage, 1 with metabolic derangement, and 4 with neurotoxicity; 2 did not receive a diagnosis of certainty. 9 of 12 patients had structural abnormalities on neuroimaging exams. Patients with ES had lower body mass index, higher rate of pretransplant portal thrombosis, and lower pre-transplant plasma concentration of albumin than patients without ES. Multiple post-transplantation systemic complications, postoperative infections, and graft rejection were correlated with a significantly higher risk of ES. Compared with patients without seizures, patients with ES had longer in-hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, higher probability of ICU readmission, in-hospital death, and need for rehabilitation. Just 3 of the 12 patients with ES had a good prognosis, while the other 9 had at least mild neurologic sequelae, 5 of whom died because of the underlying neurologic disease. Conclusions: ES after OLT may announce detrimental neurologic disease. When an underlying neurologic disease is excluded, prognosis in terms of seizure recurrence and long-term antiseizure medication need is warranted. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215080920,Single Center

The use of novel agents, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), has increased in the general population due to beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and weight loss. However, there is limited data in the SOT population. A retrospective, observational, matched cohort study in outpatient SOT recipients on injectable diabetes therapy was performed at a single academic medical center. The purpose of the study was to compare glycemic control in SOT recipients using a GLP-1-RA-containing regimen compared with insulin-only when initiated within 12 months of transplant. Seventy patients were included in the analysis with 51% of subjects in each group reaching their A1c goal within 1 year after starting diabetes therapy. The median A1c was 7.0% in the GLP-1 RA group and 6.9% in the insulin only group (P = .30). One year after starting diabetes therapy, insulin use decreased to 69% in the GLP-1 RA group, while 94% of subjects in the insulin only group remained on insulin (P = .007). There were 7.2 fewer injections per week in the GLP-1 RA group compared to 4.6 more in the insulin group (P < 0.001). In SOT recipients within 12 months of transplant, the use of GLP-1 RA for blood glucose management had the same A1C goal attainment as insulin-only while allowing for fewer injections per week. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000929643,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Zhang S.; Zhang S.,Successful Liver Transplantation After Achieving Complete Clinical Remission of Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Combination Therapy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Targeted Agents: A Case Report,2025,Transplantation Proceedings,10.1016/j.transproceed.2025.02.041,"Immunotherapy, primarily with immune checkpoint inhibitors, has become pivotal in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), leading to significant tumor burden reduction. However, its applicability in liver transplantation remains controversial. Due to the potential risks of rejection limiting large-scale clinical trials and the incomplete understanding of underlying mechanisms, whether transplant recipients can benefit from immunotherapy remains uncertain. This report describes the application of immunotherapy in liver transplantation, wherein two patients achieved complete tumor remission after receiving immunotherapy combined with other treatments before transplantation, enabling successful liver transplantation surgeries. Additionally, one patient received combination therapy with tislelizumab and lenvatinib before transplantation (Case 2), representing the first reported case utilizing this combination therapy as a bridging treatment before LT. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000746401,Targeted Therapy

Materials and Methods: We used nationwide data from the United States Veterans Health Administration to identify patients who had stone surgery between 2016 and 2018 and who were at higher risk for recurrence. Our cohort included 13,444 Veterans across 90 facilities. We examined the proportion of patients who had a post-operative urology visit or who received a prevention measure (24-hour urine test, serum parathyroid hormone measurement, or prescription of a stone-related medication) within 6 months of stone surgery. We calculated the median odds ratio to quantify facility-level variation in urology care after stone surgery, adjusting for patient- and facility-level characteristics. Results: Within 6 months of stone surgery, 94.2% Veterans had a urology visit, yet only 8.8% completed 24-hour urine testing, 8.4% had a parathyroid hormone measurement, and 31.0% were prescribed a stone-related medication. Implementation of prevention measures varied widely across facilities with the median odds ratio ranging between 1.18 for medication prescriptions and 1.77 for 24-hour urine testing. Conclusion: While most patients have a urology visit after stone surgery, stone prevention measures were implemented infrequently and inconsistently for patients at higher risk for recurrence, indicating an opportunity for quality improvement. © 2024 The Authors",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208024466,Variation (astronomy)

Current guidelines endorse completion of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessments (CGAs) in older adults prior to treatment election to objectively measure frailty, however, these are rarely performed in urologic practice due to inadequate resources. We hypothesized CGA implementation would be feasible and identify multifaceted vulnerabilities beyond standard risk assessments in a multidisciplinary BC clinic and developed a novel method to visualize “vulnerability phenotypes” to guide supportive interventions. Methods: Adults with BC were prospectively enrolled (June, 2020–July, 2021). Initially, patients underwent standard of care (SOC) risk assessment (N = 27). Subsequently, patients completed CGAs augmented with body composition assessments (N = 67). CGA completion time, rates, and patient-reported burden were assessed. Interdependence of CGA domains were quantified using Spearman correlation coefficients and compared decisional conflict and regret between arms. Vulnerability phenotypes were visualized using Spider Plots, generated in R. Clinical and survival associations with CGAs were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: 94 patients were enrolled with a median age of 72 years. Instrument completion in the CGA cohort was 79% to 100%. 91% of patients reported CGA completion was at most minimally burdensome. CGAs identified vulnerabilities including 31% vulnerable-to-moderately frail, 21% with mild-to-severe depression, 3% with mild-moderate dementia, and 40% at risk for malnutrition-malnourished. Frailty measures across instruments were weakly correlated (rho <0.4). In this heterogeneous cohort, vulnerability domains were not significantly associated with decisional conflict/regret, survival, nor complication rates after treatment. A novel Spider Plot tool is proposed to facilitate communication of the dominant vulnerability-driving individual risks. Conclusions: CGAs can be successfully incorporated into uro-oncology practice with low perceived burden, identifying key vulnerabilities with implications for clinical care. Weak correlations across instruments support the value of gathering information across discrete domains. We present a novel approach to visually characterize personalized vulnerability phenotypes. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004283444,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Standard treatments, including endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection and balloon retrograde transvenous obliteration, pose risks of arterial embolization in patients with a patent foramen ovale. This case highlights the use of EUS-guided coil embolization as an alternative approach. Methods: An 80-year-old man with cirrhosis, gastroesophageal varices, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease presented with hemodynamically significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopy revealed gastroesophageal varices with active stigmata of bleeding. A transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study confirmed a patent foramen ovale, increasing the risk of embolization with endoscopic cyanoacrylate or balloon retrograde transvenous obliteration. Given contraindications to a transjugular intravenous portosystemic shunt, EUS-guided coil embolization was performed. Results: Ten EUS-guided Nester coils were deployed until Doppler flow cessation was observed. Postprocedure endoscopy confirmed hemostasis, and hemoglobin levels stabilized. Follow-up endoscopy showed no active bleeding and shrinkage of gastric varices. The patient remained stable and was discharged 5 days postprocedure. Conclusions: EUS-guided coil embolization is a safe and effective alternative for managing gastric varices in patients with high arterial embolization risk. © 2025 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002665943,Gastric varices

The overproduction of a heterologous protein can impose various bottlenecks on these networks. Identifying and alleviating these bottlenecks can guide strain engineering efforts to enhance protein production. The methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii is used for its high capacity to produce recombinant proteins. Here, we use ribosome profiling to identify bottlenecks in protein secretion during heterologous expression of human serum albumin (HSA). Validation of this analysis showed that the knockout of non-essential genes whose gene products target the ER, through co- and post-translational mechanisms, and have high ribosome utilization can increase production of a heterologous protein, HSA. A triple knockout in co-translationally translocated carbohydrate and acetate transporter Gal2p, cell wall maintenance protein Ydr134cp, and the post-translationally translocated cell wall protein Aoa65896.1 increased HSA production by 35 %. This data-driven strain engineering approach uses cell-level information to identify gene targets for phenotype improvement. This specific case identifies hits and creates strains with improved HSA production, with Ribo-seq and bioinformatic analysis to identify non-essential ER targeted proteins that are high ribosome utilizers. © 2025 The Authors",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004345673,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to evaluate the safety of [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-I&T in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods: VIOLET was an investigator-initiated, single-centre, phase 1/2 trial, conducted at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Eligible patients were men aged 18 years or older with progressive mCRPC (histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate or unequivocal diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer with an elevated serum prostate specific antigen) previously treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and taxane chemotherapy (unless medically unsuitable), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2, and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positivity (maximum standardised uptake value ≥20 on PSMA PET-CT) without discordance on 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET-CT. Dose escalation (3 + 3 design) had three prespecified radioactivities (4·4 GBq, 5·5 GBq, and 7·4 GBq). Up to six cycles of [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-I&T were administered intravenously every 6 weeks, reduced by 0·4 GBq for each cycle. Primary endpoints of phase 1 were dose-limiting toxicities, the maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended phase 2 dose, and the primary objective of phase 2 was evaluation of adverse events as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. We present here an interim analysis, with follow-up ongoing and recruitment reopened for an additional dose level (9·5 GBq). The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05521412). Findings: Between Oct 14, 2022 and Feb 15, 2024, 30 eligible patients were enrolled. Median age was 69·0 years (IQR 66·0–74·8), screening PSA 26·9 ng/mL (10·1–70·0), PSMA mean standardised uptake value 8·2 (7·4–10·8), and 20 (67%) of 30 patients had received previous docetaxel. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. The maximum administered dose and recommended phase 2 dose was 7·4 GBq. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were limited to pain (one [3%] of 30; the only serious TRAE) and lymphopenia (one [3%] of 30). No grade 4 TRAEs or treatment-related deaths occurred. No dose reductions or treatment discontinuation occurred for toxicity. Interpretation: [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-I&T is safe at the maximum administered dose of 7·4 GBq.

We investigated whether the rates of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis are lower with hybrid closed-loop insulin therapy compared with sensor-augmented (open-loop) pump therapy in a large cohort of young people. Methods: In this population-based cohort study, we evaluated young people with type 1 diabetes from 250 diabetes centres in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Luxembourg participating in the Diabetes Prospective Follow-up (DPV) initiative. Included participants were aged 2–20 years, with diabetes duration of more than 1 year, and were treated between Jan 1, 2021, and Dec 31, 2023. The primary outcomes were the rates of severe hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis in people using closed-loop therapy versus open-loop therapy. Key secondary outcomes were differences in HbA1c levels, percentage of time in glucose range of 3·9–10·0 mmol/L, and glycaemic variability. To account for relevant confounders, we applied propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting considering several baseline characteristics. Findings: 13 922 young people (median age 13·2 years [IQR 10·0 to 16·0]; 51% male) in the DPV database met inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. 7088 used closed-loop therapy and 6834 used open-loop therapy, with a median observation time of 1·6 years [IQR 1·1 to 2·4]. Individuals using closed-loop therapy had a higher rate of ketoacidosis (1·74 per 100 patient-years) than those using open-loop therapy (0·96 per 100 patient-years; incidence rate ratio 1·81 [1·37 to 2·40], p<0·0001) and there was no significant difference between groups in the rate of severe hypoglycaemia (5·59 per 100 patient-years vs 6·63 per 100 patient-years; incidence rate ratio 0·84 [95% CI 0·69 to 1·03], p=0·089). Individuals using closed-loop therapy had a lower rate of hypoglycaemic coma (0·62 per 100 patient-years) compared with individuals using open-loop therapy (0·91 per 100 patient-years; incidence rate ratio 0·68 [95% CI 0·48 to 0·97], p=0·034). Those in the closed-loop therapy group also had a lower HbA1c level (7·34% vs 7·50%; difference –0·16% [95% CI –0·20 to –0·13], p=0·0007), higher percentage of time in target glucose range of 3·9–10·0 mmol/L (64% vs 52%, difference 12% [10 to 14], p<0·0001), and less glycaemic variability (coefficient of variation 35·4% vs 38·3%; difference –2·9% [–3·3 to –2·5], p<0·0001) than those in the open-loop therapy group. The rate of ketoacidosis was particularly high in young people with HbA1c of 8·5% or higher in the closed-loop therapy group (5·25 per 100 patient-years) compared with the open-loop therapy group (1·53 per 100 patient-years; incidence rate ratio 3·43 [95% CI 1·69 to 6·97], p<0·0001). Interpretation: Hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery has no significant effect on the rate of severe hypoglycaemia, and is associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, but is associated with a reduced risk of hypoglycaemic coma and improved glycaemia. These findings indicate the need for additional educational measures for the use of closed-loop insulin delivery.

Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HCL use during the first 6 months postpartum compared with standard care. Methods: In this prespecified extension to a multicentre, randomised controlled trial, pregnant women with type 1 diabetes at nine UK sites were followed up for 6 months postpartum. Eligible participants (AiDAPT participants recruited after the implementation of the postpartum protocol amendment approval, those still pregnant or within six months of delivery at the time of amendment implementation and still using HCL or continuous glucose monitoring [CGM] therapy) continued their randomly assigned treatment, either standard insulin therapy with CGM or HCL therapy (CamAPS FX system version 0.3.1, CamDiab, Cambridge, UK). Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio with stratification by clinical site using randomly permuted block sizes of 2 or 4. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in percentage time in range ([TIR] 3·9–10·0 mmol/L [70–180mg/dL]), measured during the periods of month 0 up to 3, months 3 to 6, and over 6 months postpartum. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ISRCTN56898625) and is complete. Findings: Of the 124 AiDAPT trial participants, 66 (53%) were ineligible for inclusion in the postpartum extension, and 57 participants consented to continue their treatment per original random allocation. The mean age was 31 years (SD 4), and all participants had early pregnancy HbA1c 59·4 mmol/mol (SD 10·5 [7·6% SD 1·0%]). In the 6 months postpartum, mean time with glucose levels within the target range was higher in the HCL group compared with the standard care group (72% [SD 12%] vs 54% [17%]), with an adjusted treatment difference of 15% (95% CI 7 to 22). Results for hyperglycaemia (>10·0 mmol/L) and mean CGM glucose also favoured HCL (–14% [95% CI –23% to –6%] and –1·3 mmol/L [–2·3 to –0·3], respectively). Hypoglycaemia rates were low, with no between-group differences (2·4% vs 2·6%). There were no treatment effect changes depending on postpartum period (0 up to 3 months vs 3 to 6 months) and no unanticipated safety problems. Interpretation: Participants in the HCL group maintained 70% TIR during the first 6 months postpartum, supporting continued use of HCL rather than standard insulin therapy for people with diabetes once they have given birth.

This study aimed to determine the incidence of type 2 diabetes over 33 481 person-years and identify its principal risk factors in middle-aged adults (ie, those aged 40–60 years) from four sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: Longitudinal data were available from 6553 participants aged 40–60 years at baseline from study centres in South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, and Burkina Faso. Sociodemographic, behavioural, clinical, and biochemical data were collected at baseline and after an interval of 5–6 years. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was determined at each timepoint and diabetes incidence was calculated. A two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis was used to identify baseline risk factors for incident diabetes. Findings: The overall incidence of type 2 diabetes was 14·6 (95% CI 13·4–16·0) cases per 1000 person-years. The incidence was highest in South Africa with 21·8 (19·5–24·4) cases per 1000 person-years, and lowest in west Africa with 5·5 (4·4–6·9) cases per 1000 person-years. Baseline glucose (adjusted odds ratio 1·37; 95% CI 1·16–1·42), being male (1·32; 1·12–1·54), family history of type 2 diabetes (1·22; 1·01–1·46), unemployment (1·19; 1·03–1·37), hypertension (1·21; 1·01–1·45), BMI (1·03; 1·02–1·04), and waist circumference (1·02; 1·01–1·03), were associated with a higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes, while adequate baseline physical activity (0·87; 0·76–1·00) was associated with lower risk. Interpretation: The high incidence of type 2 diabetes in this middle-aged sub-Saharan Africa population is influenced by several modifiable risk factors that should inform interventions to mitigate the disease burden.

We updated the systematic review and meta-analysis that informed the 2015 guidelines to inform new cutoffs for non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis for the 2024 WHO guidelines for chronic hepatitis B. Methods: We searched PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, and Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science) for studies published in any language between Jan 1, 2014, and Feb 15, 2023. We included all studies that reported cross-sectional data on the staging of fibrosis or cirrhosis with APRI, Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), and FibroScan compared with liver biopsy as the reference standard in people with chronic hepatitis B. We excluded studies in which the maximum interval between liver biopsy and non-invasive fibrosis test was more than 6 months; that reported on fewer than ten patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis; that were done exclusively in children; and did not report diagnostic accuracy across our prespecified ranges of test cutoffs. The results of this updated search were collated with the meta-analysis that informed the 2015 guidelines. Outcomes of interest were the sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive tests using defined index test cutoffs for detecting significant fibrosis (≥F2), advanced fibrosis (≥F3), and cirrhosis (F4) based on the METAVIR staging system. We performed meta-analyses using a bivariate random-effects model. Findings: Of 19 933 records identified by our search strategy, 195 were eligible for our systematic review and combined with the 69 studies from the previous meta-analysis to total 264. Two studies were at low risk of bias, 31 studies had unclear risk of bias, and 231 studies had a high risk of bias. Of these 264, 211 studies with 61 665 patients were used in the meta-analysis. For the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (≥F2), sensitivity and specificity were 72·9% (95% CI 70·2–75·5) and 64·7% (95% CI 61·0–68·2) for the APRI low cutoff (>0·3 to 0·7), 30·5% (23·7–38·3) and 92·3% (89·3–94·6) for the APRI high cutoff (>1·3 to 1·7), and 75·1% (72·2–77·7) and 79·3% (76·2–82·2) for FibroScan (>6·0 to 8·0 kPa), respectively. For the diagnosis of cirrhosis (F4), sensitivity and specificity were 59·4% (53·2–65·2) and 73·9% (70·1–77·4) for the APRI low cutoff (>0·8 to 1·2), 30·2% (24·2–36·9) and 88·2% (85·4–90·6) for the APRI high cutoff (>1·8 to 2·2), and 82·6% (77·8–86·5) and 89·0% (86·3–91·2) for FibroScan (>11·0 to 14·0 kPa), respectively. Using a hypothetical population of 1000 unselected patients with chronic hepatitis B with a 25% prevalence of significant fibrosis (≥F2), the APRI low cutoff for significant fibrosis (≥F2) would result in 262 (26·2%) false positives but only 68 (6·8%) false negatives. The FibroScan cutoff would result in 158 (15·8%) false positives and 63 (6·3%) false negatives. In a population with a 5% prevalence of cirrhosis (F4), the APRI low cutoff for cirrhosis (F4) would result in 247 (24·7%) false positives and 21 (2·1%) false negatives and the FibroScan cutoff would result in 105 (10·5%) false positives and nine (0·9%) false negatives. Interpretation: These findings have informed new thresholds of APRI and FibroScan for diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in the 2024 WHO guidelines on chronic hepatitis B, with an APRI score greater than 0·5 or a FibroScan value greater than 7·0 kPa considered to identify most adults with significant fibrosis (≥F2) and an APRI score greater than 1·0 or a FibroScan value greater than 12·5 kPa to identify most adults with cirrhosis (F4). These patients are a priority for antiviral treatment. Funding: WHO. © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the efficacy of pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (p-TIPS) in this setting. Methods: This open-label randomised trial was conducted at 17 tertiary centres in France. Patients with cirrhosis and acute fundal variceal bleeding (excluding type 1 gastro-oesophageal varices), who achieved initial haemostasis with endoscopic glue injection and vasoactive therapy, and remained stable for at least 12 h, were randomly assigned to receive either a covered p-TIPS within 72 h or to continue with on-demand glue obliteration sessions combined with NSBB. Randomisation was centralised, stratified by centre, and performed in blocks of four (1:1 ratio). The primary composite endpoint was all-cause mortality or clinically significant rebleeding within 1 year. Analyses were conducted in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. This completed study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03705078). Findings: Between Jan 3, 2019, and Feb 25, 2023, 292 patients were screened, of whom 105 were enrolled and randomly assigned. After excluding two patients who were randomly assigned by error and two who withdrew consent, 101 patients were included in the mITT population (mean age 58·2 years [SD 9·7], 81 [80%] male, 91 [90%] alcohol-related cirrhosis, mean MELD score 14·3 [SD 5·0]). Of these 101 patients, 47 were allocated to p-TIPS and 54 to glue obliteration and NSBB. The 1-year probability of being free from death or rebleeding was 77% (95% CI 62–87) in the p-TIPS group versus 37% (24–50) in the glue obliteration and NSBB group (hazard ratio 0·25 [95% CI 0·12–0·51]; p<0·0001). Rescue TIPS was required in 20 (37%) patients in the control group. Glue migration was reported in eight patients (three [6%] in the p-TIPS group and five [9%] in the control group). One case of cardiac decompensation occurred in the p-TIPS group. The 1-year cumulative incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was similar between groups (35% [95% CI 21–49] vs 32% [19–45]). Interpretation: In patients with cirrhosis and acute bleeding from fundal varices, p-TIPS significantly reduced the risk of rebleeding or death at 1 year and should be considered as first-line therapy.

The aim of this study was to examine these benefits in terms of years lived free from major non-communicable diseases in subgroups with varying levels of risk factors. Methods: Our analysis was based on a multicohort study of initially healthy European adults from the IPD-Work Consortium and initially healthy participants from the UK Biobank study. Self-reported leisure-time physical activity levels at baseline (1986–2010) were categorised as low (no or very little), intermediate (between low and recommended levels), and WHO-recommended (≥2·5 h of moderate or ≥1·25 h of vigorous physical activity per week). We divided the study population into 36 overlapping subgroups based on socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, and mental health at baseline, and assessed disease-free years between ages 40 years and 75 years for both the overall population and subgroups, accounting for coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Findings: 14 IPD-Work studies were assessed and six studies were excluded due to missing outcome data and unavailable data for pooling, resulting in the inclusion of eight studies with 124 909 participants. After the exclusion of 7685 participants due to prevalent diseases and 9265 due to missing data, the sample consisted of 107 959 initially healthy European adults (63 567 [58·9%] females and 44 392 [41·1%] males) from the IPD-Work consortium. For the UK Biobank sample, 9 238 453 million individuals were invited, 8 736 094 (94·6%) were non-respondents, and 502 359 participated in the baseline examination. After the exclusion of 73 460 participants, 428 899 participants had data on at least one measure of physical activity. 236 258 (55·1%) were female and 192 641 (44·9%) were male. During 1·6 million person-years at risk, 21 231 IPD-Work participants developed a non-communicable disease, while 101 319 UK Biobank participants developed a non-communicable disease over 4·8 million person-years at risk. Compared with individuals with low physical activity, those meeting the recommended physical activity levels during leisure-time gained an additional 1·1 (95% CI 1·0–1·2) to 2·0 (1·7–2·3) disease-free years, depending on sex and study. In males from the IPD-Work and UK Biobank cohorts, greater gains in disease-free years were observed in current smokers (2·4 [95% CI 2·1–2·8]) versus never smokers (0·7 [0·5–0·9]); those with low education (1·4 [1·1–1·7]) versus high education (0·8 [0·7–1·0]); low socioeconomic status (1·7 [1·5–2·0]) versus high socioeconomic status (0·9 [0·7–1·1]); and those with (1·6 [1·3–1·9]) versus without depressive symptoms (1·0 [0·9–1·1]; p value range <0·0001–0·0008). Similar differences were seen in women for smoking (2·3 [95% CI 1·9–2·7] vs 0·9 [0·7–1·1]), socioeconomic status (1·7 [1·4–2·0] vs 0·8 [0·5–1·0]), depressive symptoms (1·4 [1·1–1·7] vs 1·0 [0·9–1·1]), and for heavy drinkers compared with moderate drinkers (1·4 [1·1–1·6] vs 0·9 [0·7–1·1]; p value range <0·0001–0·010). No differences in physical activity-related health gains were observed between risk groups and non-risk groups by BMI, history of depression, and, in men, alcohol use (p value range 0·11–0·86). Interpretation: In addition to confirming the association between leisure-time physical activity and increased disease-free years across population subgroups, our findings show that these health benefits are often more pronounced among individuals with pre-existing health risks or disadvantaged backgrounds than in those with more favourable risk factor profiles. This suggests that enhancing population-wide physical activity initiatives could help reduce health disparities, while incorporating physical activity into targeted strategies addressing social disadvantage, unhealthy lifestyles, and depression might enhance their effectiveness.

Singh M.; Phillips K.; Wang J.; Subramanian A.; Eastwood K.-A.; Nirantharakumar K.; Crowe F.L.,"Trends in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases during pregnancy in the UK, 2000–21: a retrospective cohort study",2025,The Lancet Rheumatology,10.1016/S2665-9913(25)00039-6,"Background: Autoimmune diseases are increasingly prevalent worldwide and disproportionately affect women of reproductive age, including during pregnancy. Given the association between autoimmune diseases, comorbidities, and risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, we aimed to estimate the burden of autoimmune disease in pregnancy. Methods: This was a UK population-based retrospective cohort study using routinely collected data from two large databases (Clinical Practice Research Datalink Gold and Aurum) and associated pregnancy registers. Prevalence was calculated annually for 17 autoimmune diseases (Addison's disease, alopecia areata, ankylosing spondylitis, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's disease, SLE, systemic sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and vitiligo) in pregnancies among women of reproductive age (15–49 years) from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2021. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, describing the relationship between women's characteristics (age, ethnicity, deprivation, BMI, smoking status, and gravidity), comorbidities, and autoimmune diseases. Patient and public involvement and engagement representatives participated in formulating the research question. They also played key role in collaboration with clinicians and researchers to identify and consider the list of autoimmune diseases in the study, and played a key role in disseminating the results. Findings: 5 165 960 pregnancies in 2 831 472 women were included. In 2000–21, there were 185 208 pregnancies in 100 655 women who had a coded diagnosis of autoimmune disease. There was an increase in prevalence of the combination of 17 autoimmune diseases, from 6058 (3·5%) of 172 430 in 2000 to 8429 (4·7%) of 181 532 in 2021. Of the 17 autoimmune diseases studied, psoriasis had the highest prevalence throughout the study period. The prevalence of most of the autoimmune diseases increased from 2000 to 2021. The steepest rise was Hashimoto's thyroiditis, followed by coeliac disease, Grave's disease, and type 1 diabetes. Women in less deprived areas had higher odds of an autoimmune disease during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 1·10 [95% CI 1·07–1·14]), whereas minority ethnic groups had lower prevalence rates compared with White women (Black women 0·48 [0·45–0·51]; Asian women 0·81 [0·77–0·85]). Ex-smokers had significantly higher odds of autoimmune disease than non-smokers (1·20 [1·18–1·23]). When compared with women with a single pregnancy, the odds of having an autoimmune disease were significantly higher for women with five or more pregnancies (1·12 [1·10–1·15]). Women with metabolic and mental health conditions had significantly higher odds of having an autoimmune disease during pregnancy (type 2 diabetes, 1·41 [1·30–1·53]; hypertension, 1·07 [1·01–1·13]; anxiety, 1·15 [1·12–1·19]; depression, 1·17 [1·14–1·20]). Interpretation: The growing burden of autoimmune diseases in pregnancy calls for research into their impact on outcomes. Health policy should address gaps in specialised care to ensure individuals receive evidence-based care to prevent deterioration of the autoimmune disease and development of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Rafique M.G.; Laurent Q.; Dore M.D.; Fakih H.H.; Trinh T.; Rizzuto F.J.; Sleiman H.F.,Sequence-Defined DNA Polymers: New Tools for DNA Nanotechnology and Nucleic Acid Therapy,2025,Accounts of Chemical Research,10.1021/acs.accounts.4c00580,"Structural DNA nanotechnology offers a unique self-assembly toolbox to construct soft materials of arbitrary complexity, through bottom-up approaches including DNA origami, brick, wireframe, and tile-based assemblies. This toolbox can be expanded by incorporating interactions orthogonal to DNA base-pairing such as metal coordination, small molecule hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, fluorophilic interactions, or the hydrophobic effect. These interactions allow for hierarchical and long-range organization in DNA supramolecular assemblies through a DNA-minimal approach: the use of fewer unique DNA sequences to make complex structures. Here we describe our research group’s work to integrate these orthogonal interactions into DNA and its supramolecular assemblies. Using automated solid phase techniques, we synthesized sequence-defined DNA polymers (SDPs) featuring a wide range of functional groups, achieving high yields in the process. These SDPs can assemble into not only isotropic spherical morphologies─such as spherical nucleic acids (SNAs)─but also into anisotropic nanostructures such as 1D nanofibers and 2D nanosheets. Our structural and molecular modeling studies revealed new insights into intermolecular chain packing and intramolecular chain folding, influenced by phosphodiester positioning and SDP sequence. Using these new self-assembly paradigms, we created hierarchical, anisotropic assemblies and developed systems exhibiting polymorphism and chiroptical behavior dependent on the SDP sequence. We could also precisely control the size of our nanofiber assemblies via nucleation-growth supramolecular polymerization and create compartmentalized nanostructures capable of precise surface functionalization. The exquisite control over sequence, composition, and length allowed us to combine our SDPs with nanostructures including DNA wireframe assemblies such as prisms, nanotubes, and cubes to create hybrid, stimuli-responsive assemblies exhibiting emergent structural and functional modes. The spatial control of our assemblies enabled their use as nanoreactors for chemical transformations in several ways: via hybridization chain reaction within SNA coronas, through chemical conjugation within SNA cores, and through a molecular “printing” approach within wireframe assemblies for nanoscale information transfer and the creation of anisotropic “DNA-printed” polymer particles. We have also employed our SDP nanostructures toward biological and therapeutic applications. We demonstrated that our SNAs could serve as both extrinsic and intrinsic therapeutic platforms, with improved cellular internalization and biodistribution profiles, and excellent gene silencing activities. Using SDPs incorporating hydrophobic dendrons, high-affinity and highly specific oligonucleotide binding to human serum albumin was demonstrated. These structures showed an increased stability to nuclease degradation, reduced nonspecific cellular uptake, no toxicity even at high concentrations, and excellent biodistribution beyond the liver, resulting in unprecedented gene silencing activity in various tissues. Control over the sequence has thus presented us with a unique polymeric building block in the form of the SDP, which combines the chemical and structural diversity of polymers with the programmability of DNA. By linking these orthogonal assembly languages, we have discovered new self-assembly rules, created DNA-minimal nanostructures, and demonstrated their utility through a range of applications. Developing this work further will open new avenues in the fields of DNA nanomaterials, nucleic acid therapeutics, as well as block copolymer self-assembly. © 2025 American Chemical Society.",,Final,All Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214326910,DNA nanotechnology; DNA origami; Sequence (biology); Supramolecular Polymers

These membrane platforms play crucial roles in a variety of signaling pathways. Alterations in the lipid environment, such as those elicited by oxidative stress, can lead to important functional disruptions in membrane proteins. Cell membrane microarrays have emerged in the past decade as a powerful methodology for the study of both lipids and membrane proteins at large scales. Based on that technology and the importance of liquid-ordered subdomains, we have developed a new printed lipid raft technology with a preserved native protein structure and lipid environment. To validate this technology and evaluate its potential for different aims, raft membrane microarrays (RMMAs) containing two different cell types (astrocytes and neurons) and three different conditions (astrocytes in control situation, metabolic stress, and oxidative stress) were developed. To study differences in lipid profiles between raft domains, the MALDI-MS assay was performed on RMMAs. To evaluate the preservation of native protein activities (enzymatic activity and ligand binding) in the printed raft domains, differences in NADH oxidoreductase, GAPDH, cholinesterase activities, and sigma-1 and sigma-2 binding assays were performed. We demonstrate the performance of this new microarray technology, adapted to membrane subdomains, as valid to explore changes in lipid composition and protein activities in raft domains from brain cell lines under different stress conditions relevant for neuropathology. © 2024 The Authors.

Recent investigations have suggested that increased insight may be gained by monitoring alterations of redox state in response to exercise and hypoxia and to monitor redox trajectories in disease settings. However, conducting such studies is challenging due to the requirement for repeated venous blood sampling and intensive lab work. Droplet microfluidic sensors offer an alternative platform for developing a point-of-care testing approach using small sample volumes and automated systems to complement or ultimately replace laboratory testing. Here we developed a small, portable droplet microfluidic sensor that can measure total free thiol concentrations in 20 μL human plasma (or serum) samples, providing a reading in less than 10 min. This system features a novel method to enhance the mixing of reagent and analyte in droplets containing viscous biological fluids. The results in a range of real-world human plasma samples showed equivalence with current standard laboratory assays while reducing sample volume requirements 9-fold and fully automating the process. Micro hematocrit capillaries allowed testing of capillary blood samples collected by fingerprick lancing. The system was used to monitor total free thiols using fingerprick samples in healthy volunteers and revealed significant changes in total free thiols in response to food intake and exercise. This device has the potential to improve our ability to conduct physiological studies of total free thiol level changes and improve our understanding of redox physiology, which may ultimately be applied in redox medicine to improve patient care. © 2025 The Authors.

The 47.2 kDa lung cancer tumor marker neuron-specific enolase γ (NSEγ) was quantified in a clinically relevant concentration range of 6.25 to 100 ng/mL in NSE-depleted human serum using magnetic bead immunoprecipitation coupled to LC-high-resolution quadrupole-time-of-flight MS. The novelty of the described approach is in the combined setup of immunoaffinity extraction and the use of a full-length NSEγ calibrator and labeled NSEγ internal standard (IS) to reliably quantify the post-translationally acetylated form of this protein tumor marker in a top-down proteomics workflow. Isolation parameters and quantification using deconvolution and reconstructed extracted ion chromatograms were evaluated, and the development of a suitable liquid chromatography method was demonstrated. Various validation parameters were determined using both quantification methods, both showing acceptable performance. Additionally, deconvolution-based quantification enabled an accurate mass determination. The developed method was compared to a commercially available ECLIA and showed good correlation in sera of patients suspected of lung cancer. This assay may form the starting point for the development of a reference method for the standardization of immunoassays. © 2024 The Authors.

Conventional structural biology techniques provide static snapshots, whereas a comprehensive understanding requires an analysis of the dynamic conformations. In this study, we develop a transient cross-linking mass spectrometry method using a photo-cross-linker DCD. This cross-linker can be transiently activated to accomplish cross-linking, and with sample freezing, transient conformations are preserved, allowing temporal control and on-demand cross-linking. Its cross-linking site covers all amino acids, exhibiting diversity and providing rich structural information. Additionally, we develop a data-processing strategy by integrating a DCD-specific reporter ion and a defined ambiguous site annotation criterion, thereby ensuring the confidence in identification and cross-link site annotation. Thus, the developed transient cross-linking mass spectrometry, leveraging the distinctive features of DCD, has enabled us to analyze protein conformations and protein complexes with high resolution, take conformational snapshots, discern the coexistence of conformational intermediates, and decipher conformational fluctuations, shedding light on how proteins conformationally respond to biological signals and engage with interacting partners. Our results highlight DCD’s potential for probing protein conformational changes, facilitating the elucidation of their pivotal roles within biological systems. © 2025 The Authors.

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) can deliver the sensitivity and specificity needed for such studies at physiologically relevant conditions, however, direct detection of albumin is not typically feasible at such concentrations. Here we use a small-molecule reporter (pyrazine-2-carbonitrile, PCN) that can interact both with albumin and a SERS substrate to facilitate albumin quantification. The nanoparticle surface/PCN and albumin/PCN interactions are sufficiently balanced to yield the sensitivity and specificity needed for in vitro tissue studies. The major challenge in using SERS for such assays is that the spectra of analytes can differ from their nonresonant Raman spectra, due to distinct species forming at and near the surface of the nanoparticles. Specifically, the binding of PCN to gold nanoparticles, formation of Au-PCN complexes, as well as PCN itself, contribute to the SERS spectra. We elucidate the nature of these interactions through concentration dependence studies and computational methods. Ultimately, we show that understanding these different interactions is key to quantification of albumin, at physiologically relevant albumin concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 4.4 μM using SERS spectroscopy. These data compare well with the state-of-the-art spectroscopic method, i.e., the transport of fluorescently labeled albumin across cell layers. We anticipate that this assay will stimulate analysis in in vitro models, such as organ-on-a-chip models and flow systems. © 2025 The Authors.

The technique is based on electrospray ionization (ESI), which allows the generation of anions of nonvolatile compounds such as amino acids or large biomolecules. Electrons are photodetached from these anions. The distribution of forward and backward scattered photoelectrons is analyzed, leading to photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD), the observable of interest. The quantification of the concept is proven by blind measurements analyzing mixtures of unknown composition. The quantification of enantiomeric excess (ee) values is not only possible for signals originating from the molecular anion but also for the molecular dimer anion.

Kung L.-C.; Chu L.-K.,A Fluorescence-Based Temperature-Jump Apparatus for Illustrating Protein Dynamics on the Millisecond Time Scale,2025,Analytical Chemistry,10.1021/acs.analchem.4c06501,"A fluorescence-based temperature jump (T-jump) module was constructed to illustrate the large-domain motion of a given protein upon thermal stimulus on the millisecond time scale. The aqueous sample was readily heated by 5.0 °C in ca. 2 ms with a lasting high temperature plateau (>1 s) upon irradiation with the “optical Riemann sum” of the discrete infrared pulses of different energy sequences from a 1467 nm diode laser operated at 1k Hz. The temperature evolution was revealed by the time-evolved fluorescence intensity change of the dissolved tryptophan. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) were chosen as model proteins, and their fluorescence intensity evolutions were recorded at 36.6-39.9 °C upon T-jump from 35.0 °C, within the range of physiological temperatures. The observed protein dynamics of BSA was characterized with an apparent activation energy of 276 ± 23 kJ mol-1, whereas HSA did not manifest the dynamic component. In this measurement, only a tiny amount of sample, ca. 1 μL, was required due to the conjugation of the microspot objective, and the initial temperature was readily controlled by a homemade thermostatic pad. This millisecond-resolution technique is advantageous for illustrating the large-domain dynamics of the targeted protein, bridging the characterizations of the localized protein dynamics on nanosecond to microsecond time scales using the fast techniques and the steady-state protein conformational features by conventional methods, such as Fourier-transform infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies. © 2025 The Authors.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) involves measuring drug levels in the patient bloodstream to ensure optimal efficacy and safety, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (TI), assisting in dosage control and toxicity risk management. Amikacin (AK) and colistin (CS) are crucial antibiotics for treating multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria but they have side effects that require a precise TDM to try to minimize them. Current analytical techniques like immunoassays, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) are gold standards for the antibiotic analysis, but they may require transferring the human samples to centralized facilities, delaying crucial results and turnaround time. In contrast, plasmonic biosensors offer advantages for clinical diagnostics, enabling real-time drug detection with minimal sample volume and processing, being ideal for point-of-care applications. We have implemented plasmonic biosensors to quantify and rapidly monitor blood levels of amikacin and colistin. The biosensors provide high specificity and sensitivity, with limits of detection (LOD) of 0.92 ng/mL (1.57 nM) for amikacin and 9.11 pg/mL (7.88 pM) for colistin in blood serum. Statistics analyses demonstrated a strong correlation between the biosensor evaluation and the standard analytical methods (Spearman’s correlation coefficient of 0.9171 (p-value < 0.001) and 0.7435 (p-value = 0.04) for amikacin and colistin, respectively). Our plasmonic biosensors offer in addition, simplicity, portability, and label-free evaluation, with multiplexed capabilities. The rapid turnaround of results in under 20 min, coupled with minimal sample processing, enhances the feasibility of personalized TDM, supporting tailored treatment strategies that can improve patient outcomes. This work lays the foundation for creating an integrated point-of-care biosensor platform for effectively performing TDM of antibiotics and other drugs in real-time at the patient’s bedside in clinical settings. © 2025 The Authors.

It is also reported to be able to interact with metal ions in the human body such as Cu(II) as well as metal-binding sites in transport proteins such as serum albumin. Recent experimental studies described a ternary complex where Cu(II) is simultaneously coordinated to the C-peptide and bovine serum albumin (BSA) and provided ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra in which the absorption intensity in the 400–500 nm region depended on the order in which the species were added to the mixture. Our main goal in this study is to obtain structural insights into this ternary complex. We computed UV–vis absorption spectra for structural models of the ternary Cu(II)/C-peptide/BSA complex using time-dependent density functional theory, which can accurately reproduce experimental spectra for binary complexes of Cu(II) with the C-peptide and the metal-binding sites of BSA. A new energy penalty geometry optimization method tailored to searching for structures with high absorption at specific wavelengths is proposed. By applying this method, a model structure of a ternary complex characterized by absorption frequencies in close agreement with experiment (<0.05 eV) was found. Analysis of the electronic character of the excitations highlights the strong effect of the distance between Cu(II) and backbone ligands in this complex in modulating the absorption wavelength. © 2025 American Chemical Society",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012960851,Bovine serum albumin; Human serum albumin

Commercially available therapeutic lipidated GLP-1 analogues, semaglutide and liraglutide, have the great advantage of prolonged half-lives in vivo of hours and days instead of minutes as is the case for native GLP-1. A crucial factor in the development of novel lipidated therapeutic peptides is their physical stability, which greatly influences manufacturing and drug product development. This work provides a systematic study of the solubility, structure, oligomerization, and long-term stability of five different lipidated analogues of GLP-1, varying in the position of the lipidation site and the nature of lipid attachment. The lipidation was found to negatively impact the peptide solubility, in all cases, limiting it to a specific pH range. An increase in the α-helical secondary structure was observed upon lipidation, and the lipidated analogues were found to form larger and more stable oligomeric species compared to nonlipidated GLP-1. Importantly, the distributions and populations of oligomeric species formed were regulated by both the position and the nature of the lipidation. During the 6 days of sample aging, several lipidated analogues formed aggregates with variable morphologies ranging from elongated mature fibrils to amorphous structures. The kinetics of aggregation often showed multiple steps and did not follow a standard nucleation-propagation mechanism. A wide range of behaviors was observed, and while our observations indicate that the formation of a single stable oligomer results in the greatest physical stability, positioning the lipid group toward the N-terminus of the peptide results in extremely rapid amyloid formation. We believe that our study provides important findings for the development of long-acting lipidated analogues of peptide therapeutics. © 2025 The Authors.

Because of this, smaller injuries often go untreated. However, alternative, noninvasive routes of administration are currently unviable due to the presence of the blood-nerve barrier (BNB), which prevents passage of small molecules from the blood into the endoneurium and the nerve. This paper demonstrates that ligands on the surface of nanoparticles, called polymersomes, can enable delivery to the nerve through noninvasive intramuscular injections. Polymersomes made from polyethylene glycol (PEG)-b-polylactic acid (PLA) were conjugated with either apolipoprotein E (ApoE) or rabies virus glycoprotein-based peptide RVG29 (RVG) and loaded with near-infrared dye, AlexaFluor647. ApoE was used to target receptors upregulated in post-injury inflammation, while RVG targets neural-specific receptors. Untagged, ApoE-tagged, and RVG-tagged polymersomes were injected at 100 mM either intranerve (IN) or intramuscular (IM) into Sprague-Dawley rats post sciatic nerve injury. The addition of the ApoE and RVG tags enabled increased AlexaFluor647 fluorescence in the injury site at 1 h post IN injection compared to the untagged polymersome control. However, only the RVG-tagged polymersomes increased the AlexaFluor647 fluorescence after IM injection. Ex vivo analysis of sciatic nerves demonstrated that ApoE-tagged polymersomes enabled the greatest retention of AlexaFluor647 regardless of the injection route. This led us to conclude that using ApoE to target inflammation enabled the greatest retention of polymersome-delivered payloads while using RVG to target neural cells more specifically enabled the penetration of polymersome-delivered payloads. Observations were confirmed by calculating the area under the curve pharmacokinetic parameters and the use of a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. © 2025 American Chemical Society.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000530513,Polymersome

Hyaluronic acid was conjugated with a glycine-peptide to create a bioactive interface on PCL (static water contact angle, SCA(H2O): 98°). The scaffolds were fabricated using a melt extrusion 3D printing technique. The HA-glycine peptide conjugates were oxidized and immobilized on aminolyzed PCL via Schiff-base chemistry, introducing hydrophilicity (SCA(H2O): 21°), multiple functional groups, and a negative zeta potential (−12.04 mV at pH 7.4). A quartz crystal microbalance confirmed chemical conjugation and quantified the mass (8.5-10.3 mg m-2) of oxidized HA-glycine on PCL. The functionalized scaffolds showed enhanced swelling, improved mechanical properties (2-fold increase in strength, from 26 to 51 MPa), and maintained integrity during degradation.

Here, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with gold nanostars (NS) was used to monitor how biofilm components influence the binding and SERS signals of two antibiotics, levofloxacin (Levo) and ampicillin (Amp). The SERS signals of both antibiotics were reduced by approximately 70% (Levo) and 90% (Amp) in biofilm environments. Investigations of mixtures of model biofilm components: adenine (nucleic acids), alginate (polysaccharides) and albumin (proteins), revealed that their interactions with NS are governed by coupled equilibria. This gave surprising results, for example, alginate reduced the interference from adenine and albumin, so adding alginate increased the intensity of the antibiotic signals 4x. These findings highlight the importance of matrix component interactions in modulating detection sensitivity and show that these effects are critical in allowing clinically relevant detection levels to be achieved. © 2025 The Authors.

Here, polymeric arsenical scaffolds with varying As-functionalized acrylamide monomer (AsAm) composition are combined with PtII giving rise to hydrogels (P1-Pt−P4-Pt) with their properties being dependent on the AsAm content. The nature of the Pt−polymer interaction has been thoroughly investigated by 1H and 195Pt NMR spectroscopy as well as FT-IR, SEM, XPS, and potentiometric titration suggesting that cross-linking occurs primarily via coordination between oxygen atoms of the pendant arsenic acid group and PtII, while secondary noncovalent interactions are proposed to provide further structural integrity and stability. Importantly, the hydrogels demonstrate potential self-healing properties, while the nature of the cross-linking promotes deep penetration of water into the loosely cross-linked networks. Finally, preliminary qualitative antimicrobial evaluation conducted via disk diffusion assay indicates that P4-Pt is active against Gram-negative (uropathogenic Escherichia coli CFT073 and Escherichia coli K12MG1655) and Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus USA 300 JE2) bacterial strains.

Although nominal concentrations (Cnom) are typically used in an in vitro bioassay, freely dissolved concentrations (Cfree) are considered a more accurate dose metric because they account for chemical partitioning processes and are informative about MOA. We determined the Cfree of IL cations in AREc32 and AhR-CALUX assays using both mass balance model (MBM) prediction and experimental quantification. Partition coefficients between membrane lipid-water (Kmw), serum albumin-water (Kalbumin/w), and cell-water (Kcell/w) as well as potential confounding factors (binding to a test plate and micelle formation) were determined to improve the MBM prediction. IL cations showed a higher affinity for both cell lines than that predicted by the MBM based on Kmw and Kalbumin/w. Their affinity for the AhR-CALUX cells was more than 1 order of magnitude higher than for the AREc32, signifying cell line-specific affinity. The MBM with an experimental Kcell/w accurately predicted Cfree. Evaluating cytotoxicity based on Cfree eliminated the leveling off of toxicity observed for hydrophobic IL cations (side chain cutoff), suggesting that Cnom underestimates the effects of compounds with high affinity for the assay medium. Cell membrane concentrations calculated from Cfree using Kmw were compared to the critical membrane burden to identify whether IL cations act as baseline toxicants. The IL cations carrying 16 carbons in the chain in the AREc32 assay and most of the IL cations in the AhR-CALUX assay were classified as excess toxicants. However, since the reasons for the deviation of experimental Kcell/w from MBM prediction remain unexplained, it is uncertain whether the cell membrane concentrations can be well predicted from Kmw used in this study. Therefore, future studies should aim to uncover the underlying causes of differing cell affinities observed across cell lines and model predictions. © 2025 The Authors.

The thioflavin T (ThT) binding assay revealed that the complex [(η6-toluene)Os(NHCglu)Cl2] (where NHCglu is the N-heterocyclic carbene ligand 1-methyl-3-{2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-1-glucosyl}imidazol-2-ylidene), hence named Os-Tolu, was able to repress amyloid aggregation in a dose-dependent way. Conformational studies through circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies clearly indicated that this inhibitory effect occurred through the stabilization of α-helical structures of monomeric NPM1264−277, thus hampering self-recognition. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) studies evidenced, through the formation of coordination adducts, direct interactions of the amyloid peptide with the Os-glucoconjugate complex that, in turn, promote chemical modifications of the sequence further disfavoring the self-assembly process. Noticeably, the presence of Os-Tolu completely repressed the formation of amyloid fibers in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis and induced a slight rescue of cell viability, in contrast to its reduction caused by the amyloid model in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.

Picoplatin emerged as a promising alternative to circumvent GSH-induced tumor resistance by introducing a bulky 2-picoline ligand. Although clinical studies were encouraging, picoplatin did not receive approval. Interestingly, the anticancer potential of prodrugs based on picoplatin is widely underexplored, and even less so the respective tumor-targeting approaches. We synthesized two new “hybrid” picoplatin(II) derivatives with an oxalate or cyclobutane dicarboxylate leaving group and their corresponding platinum(IV) prodrugs with an albumin-targeting maleimide moiety or a succinimide as reference. Picoplatin(II) and its derivatives indeed reacted much slower with GSH compared to the respective analogs cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin. While PicoCarbo(IV) and PicoOxali(IV) were reduced slowly in the presence of ascorbic acid, picoplatin(IV) was extremely unstable. All three prodrugs were widely inactive in the MTT assays. The platinum(IV)-maleimide complexes rapidly bound to albumin with stable conjugates for >25 h. Albumin-binding resulted in elevated platinum plasma levels, prolonged blood circulation, and enhanced tumor accumulation of the prodrugs in mice bearing CT26 tumors. However, only maleimide-functionalized PicoCarbo(IV) and picoplatin(II) significantly inhibited tumor growth. One possible explanation is that for albumin-binding platinum(IV) prodrugs, the bulky 2-picoline moiety prevents sufficient activation/reduction to unlock their full anticancer potential. © 2025 The Authors.

However, their therapeutic use is limited by low stability due to further degradation. To address this, a native MUC7 fragment was modified using d-amino acids and the retro-inverso strategy. Given the role of metal ions in enhancing antimicrobial peptides, we analyzed the bioinorganic chemistry of these systems with Cu(II) and assessed their antimicrobial activity against fungal and bacterial strains. This study is the first to explore the correlation between metal binding mode, structure, stability, and antimicrobial activity of retro-inverso peptides as well as Cu(II) coordination in such systems. A combination of experimental techniques (potentiometry, mass spectrometry, UV-vis, circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and density functional theory calculations characterized their coordination chemistry. Our results demonstrate that the “standard” enantiomeric exchange and retro-inverso modifications of the MUC7 fragment have a minimal effect on the secondary structure and biological activity of the studied peptides and their Cu(II) complexes.

In order to clarify this phenomenon, we chose to study simple metal-peptide systems with Ala-to-Pro mutations, which excluded further amides from binding. A comparison of the metal-binding modes of Ac-AAAHAAA-NH2, Ac-AAPHAAA-NH2, and Ac-AAPHPAA-NH2 complexes with Cu(II), Zn(II), and Fe(II) is a simple and elegant way of showing that neither Zn(II) nor Fe(II) is able to deprotonate and bind to amide nitrogens. © 2025 The Authors.

On the other hand, the ruthenium(III) complexes generally show low solubility and stability in an aqueous environment but exhibit some toxicity associated with unspecific delivery. For these reasons, numerous ongoing studies deal with their encapsulation into various delivery systems to maximize their therapeutic efficacy. One of these systems can also be crystals of nontoxic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).

While proteins possess inherent thermodynamic stability, environmental factors can induce deviations from native folding pathways, leading to misfolding and aggregation, phenomena closely linked to solubility. Using the UNOPTIM program, which integrates the UNRES potential into the Cambridge energy landscape framework, we conducted single-ended transition state searches and employed discrete path sampling to compute kinetic transition networks starting from PDB structures. These kinetic transition networks consist of local energy minima and the transition states that connect them, which quantify the energy landscapes of the amyloid monomers. We defined clusters within each landscape using energy thresholds and selected their lowest-energy structures for the structural analysis. Applying graph convolutional networks, we identified solubility trends and correlated them with structural features. Our findings identify specific minima with low solubility, characteristic of aggregation-prone states, highlighting the key residues that drive reduced solubility. Notably, the exposure of the hydrophobic residue Phe19 to the solvent triggers a structural collapse by disrupting the neighboring helix. Additionally, we investigated selected minima to determine the first passage times between states, thereby elucidating the kinetics of these energy landscapes. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of Aβ monomers. By integration of multiple analytical techniques to explore the energy landscapes, our study investigates structural features associated with reduced solubility.

VAS2870 is a covalent inhibitor of mainly NOX2 and NOX5. It alkylates a conserved active-site cysteine, blocking productive substrate binding. To enhance potency and selectivity toward NOXs, we conducted some chemical modifications, leading to the discovery of compound 9a that preferentially inhibits NOX2 with an IC50 of 0.155 μM, and only upon its preactivation. We found that 9a, bearing a pargyline moiety, is also able to selectively inhibit MAOB over MAOA (465-fold) with an IC50 of 0.182 μM, being the first-in-class dual NOX2/MAOB covalent inhibitor. Tested in the BV2 microglia neuroinflammation model, 9a decreased ROS production and downregulated proinflammatory cytokines as iNOS, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression more efficiently than the single target inhibitors (rasagiline for MAOB and VAS2870 for NOXs) but also, more importantly, than their combination. © 2025 The Authors.

Upon light activation, TCI-NH efficiently favors superoxide (O2•-) and PS-centered radical formation instead of singlet oxygen (1O2) generation. Its high luminescence efficiency and selective localization in both the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria enable precise, image-guided PDT.

They have been identified in environmental matrices all over the world, proving that current treatment methods cannot eliminate them from water/wastewater. In this study, the degradation of favipiravir (FAV) and ecotoxicity changes in different water matrices were investigated using the UV, UV/H2O2, and UV/Co-doped ZnS quantum dots (QDs) photocatalytic processes. The effects of initial FAV concentration, water matrices, pH, H2O2 concentration, and catalyst amount on the FAV degradation rate were evaluated. Initial FAV concentrations (50, 100, and 150 μg/L) have a slight effect on the FAV degradation rate. The matrix composition significantly reduced the degradation rates and efficiencies for the UV, UV/H2O2, and UV/Co-doped ZnS QDs processes in the following order: wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent > tap water (TW) > distilled water (DW). The pH (4.0, 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0) had a remarkable effect on the degradation rate in all processes. The degradation rate enhanced from 86.3 to 98.1% with increasing pH from 4.0 to 9.0 due to increasing the ionization degree of FAV in the UV process. The maximum FAV degradation rate was obtained at pH 7.0 with removal efficiencies of 93.9 and 100% in UV/H2O2 and UV/Co-doped ZnS QDs processes, respectively. Transformation products of FAV were determined in UV and UV/Co-doped ZnS QDs processes. The toxicity to algae increased with increasing FAV concentrations from 50 to 150 μg/L in distilled water. Growth inhibition rates for 50, 100, and 150 μg/L FAV concentrations were 15.1, 33.3, and 36.3% at 96 h, respectively, without any treatment. After 60 min of the UV process, growth inhibition decreased below 0.5% regardless of concentration. Overall, the UV/Co-doped ZnS QDs process is effective in degrading FAV in all aqueous matrices; however, an initial treatment step is required to remove natural organic matter from actual matrices. © 2025 The Authors.

The first step involved all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) modeling of physicochemical characteristics yielding PARG molecule conformations, its contour length, and the cross-section area. It was also shown that PARG molecules, even in concentrated electrolyte solutions (100 mM NaCl), assume a largely elongated shape with an aspect ratio of 36. Using the parameters derived from MD, the PARG adsorption kinetics at the silica/electrolyte interface was calculated using the random sequential adsorption approach. These predictions were validated by optical reflectometry measurements. It was confirmed that the molecules irreversibly adsorbed in the side-on orientation and their coverage agreed with the elongated shape of the PARG molecule predicted from the MD modeling. These theoretical and experimental results were used for the interpretation of the quartz crystal microbalance measurements carried out under various pH conditions. A comprehensive analysis unveiled that the results stemming from the hydrodynamic theory postulating a lubrication-like (soft) contact of the macroion molecules with the sensor adequately reflect the adsorption kinetics. The range of validity of the intuitively used Sauerbrey model was also estimated. It was argued that acquired results can be exploited to control macroion adsorption at solid/liquid interfaces.

This study examines the effects of ILs on ubiquitin, a thermodynamically robust protein with a β-grasp structure. We found that IL-induced destabilization follows a consistent order with previous findings: [BMIM]+ > [BMPyr]+ > [EMIM]+ for cations and [BF4]− > [MeSO4]− > [Cl]− for anions. Through pH and ionic strength-dependent studies, we observed that hydrophobic interactions predominantly influence the stability of positively charged ubiquitin, with electrostatic interactions playing a secondary role. NMR studies identified residues impacted by [BMIM][BF4]; however, site-directed mutagenesis of these residues showed minimal changes in destabilization, suggesting a global effect. This led us to conduct a broader empirical analysis, incorporating solvent-accessible surface area evaluations, which confirmed that hydrophobic residues are the primary drivers of stability alterations in ubiquitin, with charged residues playing a minimal role. Additionally, single-molecule force spectroscopy results indicate that imidazolium ILs lower the unfolding barrier without altering the transition state structure, offering insights into protein folding dynamics. ILs appear to modulate the stability landscape of proteins by energetically and kinetically favoring the unfolded state over the folded state. These insights offer potential strategies for the selective tuning of protein stability, which could be exploited to modulate protein-protein or protein-substrate interactions in various applications of ILs. © 2025 American Chemical Society.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000436439,Hydrophobic effect; Modulation (music)

In this study, the 1-octanol/water partition coefficients, acid dissociation constants, phase-solubility diagrams with β-CD, and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectral changes induced by UVA1 (365 nm) irradiation were evaluated. β-CD at concentrations 50-100 times that of AVB most effectively protected the photostability of AVB. Additionally, an UVA1-insensitive species with a diketo tautomer, which has an UVC-absorbing band and the potential to cause photodegradation, was stored in the inclusion complex. Acetonitrile-water mixtures at various volume ratios were screened to mimic the internal cavity of β-CD for the AVB tautomeric species using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral integrals for the components. The results indicated that β-CD provides a hydrophobic environment similar to that of a 40-50% acetonitrile aqueous solution and enhances the photostability of AVB. However, excess β-CD induced a hyperchromic effect on the diketo tautomer. Aggregation of the AVB/β-CD inclusion complexes at β-CD concentrations of ≥2 mM enhances UVC band absorption. To avoid excess β-CD, a molar ratio of 50-100 of β-CD to AVB is recommended as the optimal composition. This study newly exhibited that the cavity of β-CD mitigates the reactivity of UVA1 toward AVB by inducing the diketo tautomer form of AVB within the cavity. © 2025 The Authors.

Plastron, the trapped air between a superhydrophobic surface and a wetting liquid, plays a pivotal role in biofluid repellency. A key challenge, however, is the often short-lived plastron stability in biofluids and the lack of knowledge surrounding it. Plastron stability refers to the duration for which a surface remains in the Cassie state before transitioning to the fully wetting Wenzel state. Here, a submersion test with real-time optical monitoring is used to determine the plastron lifetime of different superhydrophobic surfaces upon immersion in various biofluids. We find that biofluids of all types exhibit shorter plastron lifetimes compared to pure water, which is attributed to their lower surface tension and biomolecular adsorption through hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions. Proteins and glucose are identified as the major contributors to plastron dissipation in fetal bovine serum-based biofluids. Plastron minimizes the solid-liquid interface, reducing biomolecular adsorption, making its stability crucial for biofluid repellence. Thus, the effects of surface texture, feature size, Cassie solid fraction, Wenzel dimensionless roughness, and surface chemistry on plastron stability are investigated. Our key findings indicate that prolonged plastron stability and thus enhanced biofluid repellency are achieved through a combination of larger plastron volumes, increased Wenzel roughness degrees, greater Cassie solid fractions, and smaller feature sizes. We demonstrate that with optimized parameters, our surface design can maintain plastron stability and sustain a consistent solid-liquid area fraction for over 120 h in complex biofluids containing high levels of protein and glucose, underscoring a robust design for long-term use in biomedical and antifouling applications. This research is essential for advancing the design of superhydrophobic surfaces that effectively resist biofouling in diverse medical and engineering settings. © 2025 The Authors.

Exosomes (30-150 nm), are a subset of EVs playing key roles in intercellular communication. Exosomes show promise as cancer chemotherapeutic drug delivery vehicles given their low immunogenicity and cell-specific cytosolic delivery of their contents. However, inefficient drug loading limits their therapeutic application. To address this, methods for the fusion of EVs with therapeutic drug-loaded synthetic liposomes have been developed. While more efficient than passive incubation of EVs with liposomes, these risk either damage to EV membrane proteins or contamination of the EV-liposome hybrids with residual depletant molecules, which can cause side effects or hinder content delivery. Here, we present a new, weakly perturbative method, which uses acidic conditions (pH 5) to enhance the fusion of EVs and synthetic, neutral liposomes (NLs) compared to passive incubation in pH 7.4 at 37 °C. An adapted Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based lipid mixing assay confirms that fusion is enhanced with this method, albeit less efficiently than with depletant-induced fusion. This significant finding implies that lipid-only synthetic liposomes can fuse with EVs, creating EV-liposome hybrids under relevant temperature and pH conditions, without nonlipidic components, such as fusogenic amphipathic peptides, added to the synthetic liposomes. Remarkably, differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy show that this enhanced fusion corresponds with the clustering of mixtures of EVs and NLs, or EVs alone, in acidic but not neutral pH conditions. The findings support a hypothesis that content release from EVs in early to late endocytic environments may be a combination of protein-protein clustering interactions and a lipidic component. Further, this study provides a novel method for enhanced fusion of EVs and liposomes, which is expected to preserve EV membrane proteins and functionality toward the development of therapeutic hybrid drug delivery vehicles in nanomedicine applications. © 2025 American Chemical Society.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217799889,Cell fusion; Extracellular Vesicles

In the vast landscape of innovative materials developed to counteract artwork degradation, gels have emerged as ideal candidates for cleaning delicate and complex surfaces. More specifically, twin-chain networks (TCNs), i.e., sponge-like hydrogels obtained through spontaneous polymer-polymer phase separation and sustainable freeze-thawing, showed unprecedented cleaning performances on modern/contemporary iconic paintings, such as works by Jackson Pollock and Pablo Picasso. The key to their efficacy lies in the complex cleaning mechanism at the gel-substrate interface. Recent findings suggest that the pore size and connectivity, affecting the nanoscale tortuosity, play a crucial role in determining the gels’ uptake (cleaning) ability. Nonetheless, diffusion of soil through the gel networks is only part of the complex processes that control the removal of unwanted layers from painted surfaces. A deeper understanding of the cleaning mechanism requires studying the uptake of solid particulate matter: gel adhesion and surface roughness affect the cleaning performance of a gel. In this work, TCNs with modulated porosity, obtained by mixing poly(vinyl alcohol)s (PVAs) of different hydrolysis degrees and molecular weights, were characterized through different techniques (confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and rheology) to relate porosity and structural features to the surface roughness and diffusional properties of the gels.

The accuracy of microalbuminuria measurement depends on urine freshness as improper storage and slow processing can lead to protease digestion of albumin. Recently, graphene-based aptasensors have been shown to detect albumin in aged urine samples, suggesting that albumin fragments can still be recognized by these sensors. To date, nine urinary albumin fragments (F1-F9) have been reported. Meanwhile, the graphene quantum dot (GQD) has emerged as a promising material due to its noncytotoxicity, high biocompatibility, and intrinsic fluorescence properties. Its comparable size to aptamers makes it particularly attractive for albumin detection. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to reveal the binding modes of urinary albumin fragments (F1-F9) to the aptamer-bound GQD (GQDA) complex. The study compares the binding behavior of nonaggregated (N_AG) and preaggregated (AG) albumin fragments with GQDA. The results demonstrate that the spontaneous clustering of GQDA and albumin fragments occurs in all cases. However, aggregated fragments exhibit reduced aptamer accessibility due to geometric confinement and structural rigidity. Lysine-rich regions were found to play a crucial role in fragment-aptamer interactions, with F1 and F8 displaying the highest number of aptamer contacts. Notably, F8, the most stable fragment, showed the strongest interactions with aptamers, highlighting its potential as a urinary biomarker for CKD detection. The findings from this study provide valuable molecular insights into the interactions between urinary albumin fragments and GQDA, paving the way for the development of highly selective and sensitive CKD diagnostic platforms. © 2025 The Authors.

Understanding the interactions between NPs and proteins is crucial for mitigating toxicity concerns and advancing the safe use of NPs in the biomedical field. Important factors governing NPs-protein interactions include the size (curvature), surface charge, and surface state of NPs as well as coexisting ions in solvents. In this study, we focused on the effect of the NP size (curvature) on the protein secondary structure using silica NPs (SiNPs) with diameters of 10 nm, 100 nm, 1 μm, and 10 μm. The secondary structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) that interacted with SiNPs was analyzed via thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and circular dichroism (CD). Furthermore, the stirring time was varied to 1, 24, and 48 h, and the effect of the incubation time was investigated. ThT measurements showed that the β-sheet ratio of BSA was the highest when incubated with SiNPs of 10 nm diameter for 1 h. This result can be attributed to the characteristics of small SiNPs such as high curvature and large surface area per mass, facilitating more extensive interactions with BSA. Interestingly, the dependence of the ThT fluorescence intensity on the NP diameter did not show a linear pattern. This is potentially caused by a complex interplay of factors including changes in the curvature and the total surface area of SiNPs. Notably, ultrasmall SiNPs exhibited the potential to induce an abnormal protein conformation. The relationship between the SiNP size and protein secondary structure change presented in this study sheds light on critical factors for the safe and effective application of NPs in future biomedical applications. © 2025 The Authors.

SWIR emissive polymethine dyes are well-suited to this endeavor; however, advancing in vivo imaging utility with these dyes is primarily limited by hydrophobicity and/or nonspecific protein association.

The swift renal clearance and stealth behavior displayed in vivo also achieves improved noninvasive visualization of the lymphatic system.

Here we present a general approach for derivatizing free glycans with a novel linker MTZ (3-(methoxyamino)propylamine added to a bioorthogonal-functional tetrazine tag) that exploits click chemistry to generate multiple platforms of glycan coupling. This derivatization preserves glycan integrity, is reversible and quantifiable, and incorporates a bioorthogonal tetrazine tag for click coupling. A library of ABO(H) blood group MTZ-glycans was efficiently conjugated to avidin Luminex beads through a Biotin-PEG11-TCO (trans-cyclooctene) spacer, generating a multiplex array that was reproducibly interrogated in a high-throughput Luminex approach with multiple lectins and antibodies. We also rapidly profiled antiglycan IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies in multiple, serially diluted human serum samples, revealing unique repertoires of antiglycan responses in each sera. Glycans were efficiently coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) at a high density (∼19-24 glycans/BSA) to generate a neoglycoprotein library that was useful in microarray formats that provided results equivalent to those obtained from the Luminex approach.

Mitoxantrone (MTO) was chosen as a model drug, and loading/release profiles of mCNTs were evaluated. To synthesize BSA-coated mCNT, 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide were used as cross-linking agents. The success of the functionalization process was demonstrated through various analysis techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, and scanning electron microscopy. The saturation magnetization of mCNT-BSA was 15.6 emu/g, indicating its potential for magnetically targeted drug delivery systems. Finally, MTO was physically loaded on the BSA-coated mCNT (mCNT-BSA) and the results were compared to those of mCNT. mCNT-BSA showed less drug loading capacity but more release response than mCNT. Considering drug release and cytotoxicity test results, MTO-loaded mCNT-BSA nanoparticles have great potential for cancer treatment. © 2025 The Authors.

There is a crucial need for sensitive methods that collect as much information as possible about all plasma peptide forms. Statistical analysis of the delta mass distribution of peptide precursors from MS/MS spectra that were matched to 63,077 peptide sequences by X!TANDEM revealed Gaussian peaks representing heavy isotopes and hydrogen loss at integer delta mass values of −3, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4, and +5 Da. Human plasma samples were precipitated in acetonitrile, and the resulting proteins were collected over a quaternary amine resin, eluted with NaCl, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by nano liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) with an orbital ion trap (OIT). Fragment spectra (MS/MS) generated from the OIT data were fit to human fully tryptic peptides by X!TANDEM, which led to the identification of 3,888 protein gene symbols represented by three or more peptides (n ≥ 3). The peptide counts to plasma proteins from experimental MS/MS spectra were corrected against 29 blank LC-ESI-MS/MS spectra and 30 million random MS/MS control spectra to yield 2,784 true positive proteins (n ≥ 3; q ≤ 0.01). Peptides identified by fragmenting ions with Gaussian heavy isotopes and hydrogen loss that were matched to known plasma proteins, such as albumin (ALB), were shown to be true positives and agreed with the peptide sequences identified in the monoisotopic peak. Accepting the ions from the monoisotopic peak alone (±0.1 Da) yielded only 382 plasma proteins (n ≥ 3; type I error q ≤ 0.01; type II error ∼86%). In contrast, accepting all ions within ±0.1 Da around the hydrogen loss, monoisotopic, and heavy isotopic peaks led to the identification of 963 proteins (n ≥ 3; q ≤ 0.01; type II error ∼60%). Using the power of the OIT to resolve the Gaussian peaks from heavy isotopes and hydrogen loss resulted in the identification of three times more proteins with high confidence and a much lower type II error than analyzing peptides from the monoisotopic peak alone. The resolving power of the OIT may be exploited to increase observation frequencies and provide greater proteomic coverage and statistical power in comparative proteomics studies. © 2025 The Authors.

In pH 7.0 buffered aqueous solutions, the 4-quinolinium dyes absorb light that extends into the near-infrared range up to ∼950 nm. The unique direct strand breakage of pUC19 DNA that is sensitized by irradiating either dicarbocyanine with an 850 nm LED laser constitutes the first published example of DNA photocleavage upon single-photon chromophore excitation at a wavelength greater than 830 nm. Brominated dye 4, which is more stable than and achieves DNA strand scission in higher yield than its hydrogen-bearing counterpart 5, cleaves plasmid DNA under 830 and 905 nm laser illumination. The addition of increasing amounts of DNA to aqueous pH 7.0 solutions converted an aggregated form of dye 4 to a monomer with bathochromic absorption that overlaps all three laser emission wavelengths. No induced circular dichroism and fluorescence signals were detected when DNA was present, pointing to possible external binding of the dye to the DNA. Experiments employing radical-specific fluorescent probes and chemical additives showed that brominated dye 4 likely breaks DNA strands by photosensitizing hydroxyl radical production. Micromolar concentrations of the dye were relatively nontoxic to cultured Escherichia coli cells in the dark but dramatically reduced survival of the cells under 830 nm illumination. As NIR light wavelengths deeply penetrate biological tissues, we envisage the future use of carbocyanine dyes as a sensitizing agent in phototherapeutic applications. © 2025 The Authors.

Although promising for the adsorption of organic molecules, the low density of adsorption sites in these nanoparticles has been a significant challenge. In this study, an optimized factorial design with response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to produce small Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs) stabilized with tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was selected for immobilization on the surface of SPIONs to test adsorption capacity. The model was validated by correlating significant factors with experimental responses, enabling the prediction of the smallest nanoparticle size. We obtained superparamagnetic SPIONs (75.12 emu/g) with high surface area and an average diameter of 11.06 ± 0.84 nm, with stability improved by the adsorption of TEOS (−46.24 mV) and suitable for pH values from 2 to 10 and salt concentrations up to 1 M. The maximum adsorption capacity of the nanoparticles was 87.8 ± 1.79 mg of BSA per gram of nanoparticles. The nanomaterial synthesized here presents a favorable platform for anchoring protein molecules via silanol groups on its electrostatically charged surface.

The carbodiimide method used catechol group conjugation onto the Cs backbone using the catechol-containing compound hydrocaffeic acid. A degree of substitution of 2.98% was determined by spectroscopy in the chitosan-catechol (CsC) conjugate. DLS studies showed hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) close to 300 nm for PECs of Cs and CsC with ulvan, with positive zeta potential for both complexes. HA coating was confirmed by obtaining negative zeta potential. The HA coating reduced the Dh values of the materials by approximately 100 nm. This resulted in maintaining stability in water suspension for up to 8 weeks, yielding unimodal size distribution. ATR-FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of the polyelectrolytes in the PECs. FE-SEM studies demonstrated that HA-coated NPs exhibited smaller sizes than their uncoated counterparts. PECs with CsC maintained higher free radical scavenging activity than those with unmodified Cs, with the HA coating only reducing antioxidant activity by 16%.

Yamauchi M.; Tojo H.; Arakaki T.; Ishida T.,Improved Frontal Gel Filtration Chromatography to Examine the Interaction between Small Molecules and a Protein with Multiple Specific Binding Sites,2025,ACS Omega,10.1021/acsomega.4c07939,"Interaction between small molecules (ligands) and a protein is the basis of protein function and drug action. Therefore, it is essential to know the number and binding constants of specific binding sites that are most relevant to protein functions. These binding parameters can be estimated by the analysis of the average number of bound ligands per protein (r) as a function of free ligand concentration ([L]f). Frontal gel filtration chromatography (FGC) is a well-established method to obtain a fraction of free ligand from a protein-ligand mixture without any disturbance of the original binding equilibrium of the mixture. The ligand concentration of this fraction gives [L]f, and r is obtained as the ratio of the difference between the total ligand concentration and [L]f to the total protein concentration. The serious drawback of conventional FGC is large sample consumption to perform a single experiment. Here, we improved FGC using microbore columns packed with gel matrix (particle size 4 μm, pore size 12.5 nm) and an automated injection system to reduce sample consumption to 100 μL levels. Its performance was tested on the interaction of 5 vertebrate serum albumins with aromatic compounds of methyl orange, dabsyl amino acids, and S- and R-warfarin. A subtle chiral difference in the warfarin binding was clearly detected for human serum albumin. A large species difference in S-warfarin binding to albumin was also found. Further scale-down of FGC with a capillary column is suggested to be possible by simulation using the program developed in the present study, promising broader application of FGC to various binding systems. © 2025 The Authors.

Azhagesan A.; Chandrasekaran N.,Exposure of Polystyrene Micro- and Nanoplastics to Simulated Human Digestive Enzymatic Systems: Structural and Functional Implications,2025,ACS Omega,10.1021/acsomega.4c07974,"The current in vitro study explores the exposure of the emerging pollutants polystyrene micro- and nanoplastics (PS-MNPs) within the digestive system and their interaction with key digestive enzymes such as α-amylase, pepsin, and pancreatin. The present research aims to elucidate the potential health implications of digestive enzymes by PS-MNPs based on the previously estimated mean of ingested microplastics (MPs) (0.714 g/day). The study deepens our understanding of the environmental pollutants’ impact on human health by examining the interactions between polystyrene (PS) microplastics (PS MPs, 37-50 μm approx.) and PS nanoplastics (PS NPs, 100 nm) with digestive enzymes. The study analyzes the effects of micro- and nanosized plastics on enzyme activity using multiple spectroscopic techniques, revealing the molecular mechanisms of enzyme inhibition and structural changes caused by PS NPs, more than those by PS MPs. The fluorescence emission spectra indicated a static quenching mechanism across all the digestive enzymes at Kq = 3.638, 4.615, and 1.855 (∼× 1018 M-1·s-1), predominantly affecting tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp) residues. Resonance light scattering (RLS) spectra confirmed the formation of enzyme-PS NPs complexes, leading to aggregation. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry results showed a decrease in protein content and structural alterations in the enzymes, potentially affecting their function. The half inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of PS NPs for salivary α-amylase (180 μg/mL), pepsin (580 μg/mL), and pancreatic protease (314 μg/mL) indicate uncompetitive inhibition, and that of pancreatic α-amylase (592 μg/mL) indicates mixed reversible inhibition of digestive enzymes. The study highlights the potential health risks associated with PS NPs exposure and gives a broader understanding of the interplay between environmental plastic pollutants and human health. © 2025 The Authors.

Herein, in continuation of our efforts to improve the therapeutic efficacy of 4-aminoquinoline-pyrimidine (4-AQ-Py) based molecular hybrids, a series of 4-AQ-Py hybrids linked through diamine-piperazine (flexible and rigid) linkers was synthesized and assessed for in vitro antiplasmodial activity. In the in vitro assay, these hybrids exhibited excellent potency and selectivity index against both the chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive (D6) and CQ-resistant (W2) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Compound 7i was found to be the most potent (5-fold more active than CQ) against the D6 strain, while compound 7e displayed the most potency (53-fold more potent than CQ) against the W2 strain. Furthermore, nine compounds (7d, 7f-i, 7l, and 7o-q) showed better antiplasmodial activity than the reference drug artemisinin (ART) against the D6 strain, and compared to ART, seven compounds (7d-e, 7i-k, and 7p-q) demonstrated better activity against the W2 strain. All the synthesized hybrids were found noncytotoxic against the mammalian VERO cell lines. Two potent compounds, 7e and 7i, were evaluated for their in vivo antiplasmodial activity against P. berghei-infected mouse models.

While the inorganic polymer polyphosphate (polyP) is ubiquitous in living organisms and is also widely involved in mineralization regulations, its specific influence on the mineralization balance of teeth remains unclear. As a concept-and-proof study, the effects of polyP on the demineralization and remineralization of teeth are investigated on dental enamel (the highly mineralized outer covering tissue of teeth) from the perspective of mineralization balance. We found that a high concentration (containing 1.0-20 mM P element, comparable to and higher than the free phosphate ions in body fluids) of polyP has the capability to demineralize enamel in the aqueous solution, yet this effect is absent in the simulated biological environments including simulated body fluid and MEM (α-minimum essential medium) solutions. More importantly, polyP with a very low concentration (containing ≥5.0 μM P) is able to inhibit enamel mineralization significantly. This suggests that polyP could impact the mineralization balance of enamel by preferentially inhibiting the remineralization process, thereby disrupting the equilibrium necessary for maintaining enamel health. © 2025 The Authors.

Additionally, a biomarker model was constructed to simulate changes in pRB and TOPO-IIα expression. Methods: The population PBPK and biomarker models of ABE were developed using physicochemical, pharmacokinetics (PK), CDK4/6 occupancy, biomarker, and physiological properties. These models were then validated using four clinical plasma PK studies, two CSF PK studies, and one clinically observed biomarker expression change in patients. Results: The PBPK model showed good consistency with observed data, with most prediction-to-observation ratios falling within the range of 0.5 to 2.0 for AUC, Cmax, Cmin in plasma and CSF. Key factors affecting Cmin and CDK4/6 occupancy for total analytes (sum of ABE and metabolites) were identified as CYP3A4, ABCB1, ABCG2 expression, and plasma albumin levels. PBPK simulations suggested that the optimal dosing regimen for ABE in brain metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is either 150 or 200 mg twice daily (BID). Conclusions: The PBPK model successfully simulated the PK profiles and CDK4/6 occupancy for ABE and its three metabolites in plasma and CSD, and determined the optimal dosing in brain MBC.

The use of nanotechnology to deliver mAbs to intracellular domains has been highlighted as a strategy with high potential. Working toward this goal, we have recently developed and validated palmitoyl hyaluronate (HAC16)-based nanoassemblies (HANAs), a novel technology for the intracellular delivery of mAbs in Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Virus (KRAS)-mutated tumors, one of the most prevalent and a challenging intracellular oncoprotein. Despite their success, the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of these delivery vehicles are still unknown due to their chemical complexity, a challenge common to a large proportion of drug delivery nanomedicines. To support further development and clinical translation, we present an efficient radiolabeling approach with the positron emitter zirconium-89 (89Zr) for the in vivo evaluation of HANAs by whole-body PET imaging. Additionally, we assessed the impact of PEGylation and size modulation on the biodistribution profile of mAbs using 89Zr-radiolabeled PEGylated and non-PEGylated HANAs. Our PET imaging results demonstrated that HANAs significantly modify the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the 89Zr-mAb. Furthermore, we established that the biodistribution of HANAs can be conveniently modulated by introducing PEG polymers on the surface, facilitating customization for cancer applications.

In compounds P17 and P18, the 2-naphthyl-l-Ala moiety was replaced with a less lipophilic 3-styryl-l-Ala moiety while the cyclohexyl ring in P18 was replaced with a phenyl group. The first ever crystal structure of the PSMA/PSMA-617 complex reported here revealed a folded conformation of the PSMA-617 linker while for the PSMA/P17 and PSMA/P18 complexes, the extended orientations of the linkers revealed linker flexibility within the PSMA cavity, a change in binding that can be exploited for the structure-guided design of PSMA-targeting agents. Despite structural differences from PSMA-617, the analogs maintained high PSMA inhibition potency, cellular binding, and internalization. In vivo biodistribution studies revealed comparable tumor uptake across all three compounds with P18 displaying higher spleen accumulation, likely due to phenyl ring lipophilicity.

Although these diseases are irreversible, knowing the aggregation mechanism is useful in developing drugs that can arrest or decrease the aggregation rate. In this study, we are interested in investigating the effect of Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB G-250) on the aggregation of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) at pH 7.4. Various biophysical techniques have been used, such as turbidity, Rayleigh light scattering (RLS) kinetics, far-UV circular dichroism (CD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. The turbidity data indicated that CBB (≥0.1 mM) induces aggregation in HEWL at pH 7.4. The aggregation kinetics caused by CBB are quick without a lag phase and are dependent on the CBB concentration. The far-UV CD data revealed that the CBB-induced aggregated samples had lost their CD signals without exhibiting a shift in the spectrum position. Sodium chloride and ammonium sulfate show little effect on the CBB-induced aggregates, but alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol could reverse the aggregation. Overall, this study aims to better understand the mechanism underlying CBB-induced aggregation and keep in mind that CBB employed in laboratories can alter the protein structure. We report the aggregation of a natural protein due to coiled-coil formation induced by a dye at physiological pH and temperature conditions.

Recent studies suggest that inhibiting VHR could be beneficial in treating sepsis and septic shock. VHR belongs to the superfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), a large class of enzymes that are notoriously difficult to target with small molecules. Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) has emerged as an effective strategy for generating potent ligands, even for challenging drug targets. Here, we present a fluorine NMR-based discovery platform for identifying fragments that bind to VHR. This platform encompasses automated library assembly, mixture formation, quantitative material transfer, fluorine NMR screening, and biophysical hit confirmation. We demonstrate that this streamlined, integrated screening workflow produces validated hits with diverse chemical matter and tangible structure-activity relationships (SAR). Crystal structures yielded detailed information on the fragment-protein interactions and provide a basis for future structurally enabled ligand optimization. Notably, we discovered novel ligand binding sites on VHR, distant from the conserved active site, facilitating the generation of selective VHR modulators. This fragment discovery platform can be applied to other PTPs and holds significant potential for identifying potent and selective ligands. © 2025 The Authors.

These compounds have been extensively studied due to their unique physicochemical properties and biocompatibility. Leveraging these beneficial properties, this study aimed to create a multifunctional protective formulation by synthesizing nanoparticles from PHB and ectoine, which are acknowledged for their anti-ultraviolet B (UVB) and anti-irritation properties. The covalent bonding of PHB and ectoine was achieved using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), and the nanoparticles were produced through centrifugation. The synthesized nanoparticle (PHB-ectoine NPs) was physicochemically characterized and tested for anti-irritation and anti-UVB properties in vitro. The characterization revealed a homogeneous spherical shape with a distinct layered structure, primarily composed of carbon and oxygen. The PHB-ectoine NPs measured 527 ± 228 nm in size, had a zeta potential of −61.47 ± 0.64 mV, and exhibited notably higher anti-irritant and anti-UVB activities compared to PHB alone, by over 10 and 4 times, respectively. Furthermore, the addition of a rhamnolipid solution as a dispersant provided the nanofluid with antibacterial properties againstStaphylococcus aureus. These results indicate that the rhamnolipid-PHB-ectoine nanoformulation shows significant potential as a multifunctional skin protective agent with anti-irritation, anti-UVB, and antibacterial capabilities. © 2025 The Authors.

Before performing experiments in vivo, we performed FMO analysis based on TD-DFT/B3PW91-D3/6−311G++** calculations, displaying a combination of favorable reactivity indices for all compounds (2−25), including low Eg values, high softness, and balanced electronegativity and electrophilicity. Their diverse structural features for all compounds suggest that they may interact with different biological targets or have varying mechanisms of action. The in vivo evaluation of the anti-inflammatory analgesic and calcium channel-blocking effects was carried out in mice and rats, respectively. A carrageenan-induced paw edema model was adopted to measure the reduction in paw volume. An acetic acid-induced writhing test was conducted to evaluate the writhing response in mice. Additionally, isolated aortic ring preparations from rats were used to investigate the potential calcium channel-blocking effect against high K+-induced contraction in the organ bath assembly. In the series, seven derivatives 2, 7, 12, 22, 25, 8, and 18 exhibited potent activity, with 83.33−80.00% decreases in edema, which is closer to the value of the standard compound indomethacin, showing 86.95%. Similarly, the remaining derivatives exhibited significant to less activity, showing 76.92−47.36% decreases in edema. In the case of analgesic activity, all of the products significantly increased the pain threshold time, mainly, compounds 18, 23, and 10, which had the best analgesic effects of 18.92 ± 1.10, 18.91 ± 1.81, and 17.00 ± 1.28 s, respectively, when compared with indomethacin as the standard (20.00 ± 1.60) using the hot plate test. Likewise, in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, six compounds showed potent inhibitory effects from 76.82 to 63.29%, while in CCB activity against high K+ (80 mM) in aortic ring preparations, compound 7 showed the maximum vasorelaxant effect with an EC50 value of 2.24 μg/mL (1.0−3.48).

Commercial products available in the market for veterinary use consist of partially purified preparations of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). eCG is a heterodimeric glycoprotein and is thus extremely challenging to quantify through chromatography. Pharmaceutical companies usually carry out in vivo methods to measure the potency of finished products containing eCG. Considering the three Rs principle (refinement, replacement, and reduction), the aim of this study was to develop in vitro assays using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and cell culture techniques to predict the biological activity of products containing eCG. The experimental conditions established for the chromatographic method allowed an efficient separation between the eCG peaks and the excipients present in the formulation, with a consistent chromatographic profile between batches of eCG-products and the analytical standard (PMSG). In cell culture, stimulation of MA-10 cells with both PMSG and products containing eCG resulted in significant progesterone production in all tested concentrations and a similar profile between the products and control, indicating substantial biological activity. The data presented corroborate the potential use of the combination of the chromatographic profile and cell culture method for the successful quality control of commercial preparations containing eCG. Beyond the practical benefits of reduced time and cost, these approaches align with a growing recognition of the need to reduce the reliance on animal models for the quality control of products containing eCG. © 2025 The Authors.

Therefore, the retention of the entrapped gas is an important condition in bubble formulations, especially for MBs and NBs with lipid shells, and the stability of the lipid membrane is considered to be affected. We previously developed NBs, which are polyethylene glycol-modified liposomes entrapping an ultrasound contrast gas that can serve as nucleic acid carriers and ultrasound contrast agents. In particular, NBs containing cationic lipids were useful as systemic delivery tools that can load genes and nucleic acids on their surfaces. However, the gas retention of NBs containing cationic lipids were low, leaving room for improvement as ultrasound contrast agents. In this study, we attempted to prepare NBs containing anionic lipids to improve their stability in vivo, and found that they lasted longer in contrast time than previous NBs. In order to utilize anionic NBs, we evaluated their usefulness as systemic delivery tools for cationic-peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO). PMO has attracted attention as a therapeutic agent for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); however, its charge neutrality makes its delivery into muscle fibers challenging, especially more difficult to apply PMO to myocardial damage. We examined the systemic delivery of PMO to the heart using a combination of anionic NBs and ultrasound. Furthermore, we evaluated the usability of octaarginine (R8), a cationic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), in loading PMO onto the surface of NBs and verified the potential of PMO-loaded NBs as a therapy for cardiac dysfunction in muscular dystrophy. © 2025 The Authors.

However, despite their widespread use, limited studies have examined how organic solvents inhibit these sensors. This study investigates the enzymatic reactions and structure of the selected model enzyme, papain, a protease derived from Carica papaya, in the presence of various organic solvents. Enzyme activity was monitored through the hydrolysis of Nα-benzoyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA), with the resulting yellow product, p-nitroaniline, measured at a wavelength of 430 nm. The experiments incorporated a 10% (v/v) concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to ensure the solubility of BAPNA. Results showed that methanol and ethanol increased the Km value while causing little change in Vmax, which negatively impacted the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency. In contrast, acetonitrile (ACN) behaved as a reversible mixed-competitive inhibitor of papain, exhibiting lower millimolar IC50 values. Furthermore, an emission maximum shift to lower wavelengths with increasing concentrations of ACN suggested that the tryptophan residues within the enzyme structure were slightly more buried. Molecular dynamics simulations of the BAPNA-papain complex in cosolvent environments containing water, DMSO, and ACN indicated that ACN could act as a mixed-competitive inhibitor alongside BAPNA and that solvent polarity could influence the binding of BAPNA to papain. These findings provide valuable insights for the application of organic solvents in biosensor technologies. © 2025 The Authors.

NaOH, KOH, Ba(OH)2·8H2O, K2CO3, Et3N, SOCl2, HCl, HOAc, and Ac2O were utilized in different solvents and reaction conditions; however, all attempts failed to access the desired product in an efficient and productive way. A good success was achieved employing excess of piperidine, as base in refluxing ethanol. The reaction completed in 3 days; however, the product was obtained in 85% purity. In order to minimize the formation of side products, and taking in consideration a greener approach, such as shortening the extended reaction time and reducing excess production of organic wastes, the reaction was performed under controlled microwave reaction conditions.

Herein, GO particles were synthesized from graphite, and subsequent reduction was carried out to obtain RGO particles. To ensure a thorough assessment of particle size, functionalization, and purity, the particles were characterized by using UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Comprehensive characterization revealed that the transformation from GO (∼21.6% content of oxygen) to RGO (∼13.3% content of oxygen) results in an enrichment in the proportion of sp2 carbon. Additionally, rat cardiac myoblasts of the H9c2 cell line were subjected to Ang II to induce cellular hypertrophy, leading to cytoskeleton remodeling, increased cardiac myocyte surface area, extracellular matrix alterations, and collagen type 1a upregulation. To evaluate cytotoxicity, H9c2 cells were treated with RGO and GO suspensions at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10,000 μg/mL, and metabolic viability was assessed in both concentration- and time-dependent assays. GO and RGO reduced the viability of H9c2 cells; however, the metabolic viability assays showed that the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for GO and RGO were significantly lower in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, with GO exhibiting an IC50 of 12.6 ± 10.7 μg/mL and RGO exhibiting an IC50 of 86.3 ± 12.9 μg/mL, compared to control cells (676.0 ± 80.3 μg/mL for GO and 152.9 ± 40.1 μg/mL for RGO). These results demonstrate that under hypertrophic conditions, there is a significant increase of cytotoxicity for GO (50-fold increase) in comparison to RGO (1.7-fold increase). It was demonstrated that GO particles create a pro-oxidative environment that ultimately leads to mechanistic impairments and cell death. Vulnerable populations predisposed to cardiac damage may be at increased risk of experiencing toxicity caused by the use of GO particles in potential bioapplications. © 2025 The Authors.

This study uses bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a template protein, low critical cosolubility temperature (LCST)-type ionic liquids as temperature-sensitive functional monomers, imidazole ionic liquids, and acrylamides as auxiliary functional monomers to prepare MICs with specific recognition, temperature sensitivity, interpenetrating macroporous structure, and large specific surface area. The MICs prepared at freezing temperature have uniform macroporous structures and good mechanical properties, which is conducive to the improvement of the mass transfer and adsorption capacities. Due to the advantages, the MIC reaches the adsorption equilibrium within 125 min with a saturated adsorption capacity of 741.5 mg g-1 and an imprinting factor of 1.65. Their static and dynamic adsorption behaviors are more in line with the Langmuir model and the quasi-secondary kinetic model, respectively. In addition, the MIC has obvious temperature sensitivity, and the maximum adsorption amount is reached at 37 °C. The separation factor (relative to cytochrome c, bovine blood hemoglobin, and lysozyme) of the MICs for BSA is up to 1.39.

Against neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has been proven to be a unique AID treatment strategy by decreasing the effects of pathogenic autoantibody. Our previous study revealed that FcRn inhibition is beneficial in UC treatment through reducing colonic neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation via accelerating serum antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) clearance. In this study, we initially confirmed the specific impact of downregulating FcRn in preventing UC relapse by injecting rAAV, which is carrying Fcgrt-shRNA, in mice. Next, we investigated the inhibition effects and regulation mechanisms of baicalein (BCL) on FcRn and assessed its capacity to withstand UC recurrence using NCM460 cells and dextran sodium sulfate-induced mice models by determining the expression of FcRn and its related transcription factors. We also measured colonic NET-associated protein (NAP) expression and serum concentrations of IgG, ANCA, TNF-α, IL-1β, and c-reactive protein (CRP). UC inflammation severity was determined by using the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological score (HS). BCL treatment remarkably decreased the mRNA and protein contents of FcRn, p50, and p65 but did not impact STAT1 expression or the phosphorylation of IκB and STAT1. Long-term BCL administration inhibited colonic FcRn expression and reduced serum ANCA levels, colonic NAP expression, serum inflammation-related indexes (including TNF-α, IL-1β, and CRP), and DAI and HS scores in UC mice during inflammation relapse better than salazosulfapyridine.

Hence, this work developed and characterized polyethylene glycol-functionalized silk fibroin nanoparticles for oral delivery of cefotaxime (PEG/SFPs-CTX), with a focus on the in silico simulations and process greenness. The particles were formulated by the two methods of co-condensation and adsorption. Dependent on the processes, the particles possessed spherical shape, smooth/rough surfaces, nanosize (170-650 nm), negative charge (−23 to −30 mV), and drug entrapment efficiency of ∼50%. The system rapidly absorbed the drug within 30 min, followed second-order kinetics, and significantly controlled the drug release rate in the simulated gastrointestinal system, which could bypass the stomach acidic pH. Interestingly, in silico docking revealed that CTX mostly bound strongly and noncovalently with fibroin, particularly at glutamic acid, via hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and π-π interactions, while PEG enhanced the stability of the system. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the complex’s stability under physiological conditions.

In prior studies, radiofluorination of sultones (i.e., cyclic sulfonate esters) was shown to easily afford, by ring opening, [18F]fluorosulfocompounds as a new class of promising hydrophilic radiophamaceuticals. Herein, we first depict a further exploration of the 18F-radiochemistry of sultones, including a comparative study with acyclic sulfonate esters. Propane sultones were found to be highly reactive toward [18F]TBAF (tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride) under mild anhydrous conditions and far more reactive than acyclic analogues (mesylate and tosylate) and butane sultones. We then developed the 18F-labeling of protein (human serum albumin) and glycoprotein (recombinant human erythropoietin) according to a double ring opening strategy from a bispropane sultone involving radiofluorination followed by subsequent bioconjugation in aqueous buffer solution to the ϵ-amino group in lysine residues. Overall, the results highlight the distinction of propane sultones vs acyclic analogues for radiofluorination, and they confirm the viability of the bispropane sultone as a novel key precursor for the 18F-radiolabeling of biopolymers under biocompatible conditions.

Notable examples of such disorders include psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn’s disease. Research highlights the therapeutic potential of animal-derived peptides under these conditions. Advances in discovering promising drugs involve advanced bioinformatics techniques, such as molecular docking combined with in vitro studies, which have shown consistent results. This study aimed to explore and characterize peptides derived from the enzymatic hydrolysis of bullfrog skin proteins with the potential to modulate multiple inflammatory pathways, particularly through cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and IL-6 downregulation. Bullfrog skin was lyophilized, and peptides were extracted through enzymatic hydrolysis. Peptide fractionation was performed using solid-phase extraction, and mass spectrometry was performed on the target fraction. A molecular docking analysis was subsequently utilized to predict the interactions of the peptides with the COX active site. The peptide sequences were investigated for their potential to inhibit the COX enzymes through a colorimetric inhibition assay. The IL-6 expression was evaluated on the selected peptide sequence using a Murine Mini ABTS IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) development kit. Based on the results, the bullfrog skin hydrolysates, especially those obtained through trypsin digestion, exhibited a significant dose-dependent enhancement in the cell viability of RAW 264.7 macrophages. Notably, the F4 fraction, isolated by solid-phase extraction, demonstrated the most pronounced effect. Mass spectrometry analysis of the F4 fraction identified 71 low-molecular-weight peptide sequences corresponding to different bullfrog proteins. Four peptides (P1, P2, P3, and P4) were selected for synthesis based on molecular docking results, which predicted a high binding affinity and favorable interactions with the COX active site, especially for peptide GPSGPAGARGDK (P3). Despite the strong binding affinity of P3, biological proof-of-concept studies revealed that SGHPGAMGPVGPR (P1) exhibited the most significant results, effectively inhibiting total COX activity and downregulating IL-6 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages at a concentration of 1 mM. The P1 peptide exhibited structural stability and demonstrated a superior ability to modulate the inflammatory response. Although some discrepancies between molecular docking and in vitro results were observed, this study highlights the importance of integrative analyses in enhancing success rates for identifying viable therapeutic candidates. Overall, the findings indicate that peptide P1, identified within the F4 fraction, is a promising candidate for further optimization as a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, with potential applications in the development of biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. Further controlled studies are necessary to elucidate additional mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory properties and to refine its therapeutic potential. © 2025 The Authors.

Kalita S.; Danovich D.; Shaik S.,Origins of the Superiority of Oscillating Electric Fields for Disrupting Senile Plaques: Insights from the 7-Residue Fragment and the Full-length Aβ-42 Peptide,2025,Journal of the American Chemical Society,10.1021/jacs.4c14791,"Our recent molecular dynamics simulations of decomposing Alzheimer’s disease plaques, under oscillating- and static external electric fields (Os-EEFs and St-EEFs), revealed the superiority of Os-EEF for decomposing plaques consisting of the 7-residue peptide segment. This conclusion is now reinforced by studying the dimers of the short peptides and trimers of the full-length Aβ-42 peptide. Thus, the dispersed peptides obtained following St-EEF applications reformed the plaques once the St-EEF subsided. In contrast, plaques originating from the application of Os-EEF remained dispersed for long time scales. The present study provides insights into these results by modeling the decomposition modes that transpire under both field types. Additionally, this study provides insights into the frequency effects on the decomposition processes within the THz-MHz regions. The simulation shows that the Os-EEF in the lower frequency range (≤GHz) decomposes the plaque on a time scale of ∼50 ns, whereas the higher frequency Os-EEFs (≥THz) are less effective. As such, Os-EEFs with moderate-to-low frequencies (≤GHz) lead to an “explosion,” whereby the peptides fly distantly apart and inhibit plaque reformation. By contrast, St-EEFs form parallel peptide pairs, which are stabilized by the EEF due to the large dipole moment of the ensemble. Thus, St-EEF applications lead to sluggish and reversible plaque decomposition processes. We further conclude that the Os-EEF impact is maximal for short pulses, which prevents the EEF propensity to arrange the peptides in parallel pairs. The superiority of the Os-EEF over the St-EEF is maintained irrespective of the peptides’ length. A model is formulated that predicts the dependence of the decomposition time scale on the EEF. © 2025 The Authors.

Although specific fluorescent molecular imaging probes are commonly used for the real-time analysis of the localization and distribution of drug targets in cells, they are almost invariably composed of a linker connecting the pharmacophore with a large fluorophore. In this study, we have developed miniaturized fluorescent probes targeting MAGL by incorporating a highly fluorescent boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moiety into the inhibitor structure that interacts with the MAGL active site. These miniaturized fluorescent probes exhibit favorable drug-like properties such as high solubility and permeability, picomolar potency for MAGL across various species, and high cell selectivity and specificity. A range of translational investigations were conducted, including cell-free fluorescence polarization assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and confocal fluorescence microscopy of live cancer cells, live primary neurons, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids. Furthermore, the application of red-shifted analogs or 18F positron emission labeling illustrated the significant versatility and adaptability of the fluorescent ligands in various experimental contexts. © 2025 The Authors.

It is common among men with diabetes, often due to severe damage to blood vessels. Researchers found a need for better therapies for diabetic ED. They created a new humanized antibody, MT-100, which targets the Tie2 receptor. The Tie2 receptor is important for keeping blood vessels stable and protecting nerves. In their study, they tested MT-100 on diabetic mice. After injecting MT-100, the mice showed better erectile function due to improved blood vessel and nerve growth. MT-100 also helped cells survive and reduced oxidative stress, which is damage caused by harmful molecules. The study suggests MT-100 could be a promising treatment for diabetic ED by supporting blood vessel and nerve health. Future studies might look at MT-100 for other blood vessel diseases. This summary was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the author. © The Author(s) 2025.; Diabetes is an incurable, chronic disease that can lead to many complications, including angiopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and erectile dysfunction (ED). The angiopoietin-Tie2 signaling pathway plays a critical role in blood vessel development, formation, remodeling, and peripheral nerve regeneration. Therefore, strategies for activating the Tie2 signaling pathway have been developed as potential therapies for neurovascular diseases. Here, we developed a human Tie2-agonistic antibody (MT-100) that not only resists Ang-2 antagonism and activates Tie2 signaling but also regulates a novel target, sushi repeat-containing protein X-linked 2 (Srpx2). This regulation led to the survival of vascular and neuronal cells, a reduction in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of the PI3K/AKT/eNOS signaling pathway, increased expression of neurotrophic factors, and ultimately alleviation of ED in diabetic mice. Our findings not only provide conclusive evidence that MT-100 is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetic ED but also suggest it has substantial clinical applications for other complications associated with diabetes. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213720757,Angiopoietin; Angiopoietin receptor; Diabetic Neuropathy; Neurovascular bundle

Previous studies have demonstrated that RBP4 plays a role in cold-mediated adipose tissue browning and thermogenesis. However, the role of RBP4 in brown adipose tissue and its metabolic significance remain unclear. Here we generated and studied transgenic mice that express human RBP4 (hRBP4), specifically in brown adipocytes (UCP1-RBP4 mice), to better understand these uncertainties. When fed a chow diet, these mice presented significantly lower body weights and fat mass than their littermate controls. The UCP1-RBP4 mice also showed significant improvements in glucose clearance, enhanced energy expenditure and increased thermogenesis in response to a cold challenge. This was associated with increased lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in brown adipose tissue, which was attributed to the activation of canonical adrenergic signaling pathways. In addition, high-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that plasma RBP4 and retinol levels were elevated in the UCP1-RBP4 mice, whereas their hepatic retinol levels decreased in parallel with a chow diet. Steady-state brown fat levels of total retinol were significantly elevated in the UCP1-RBP4 mice, suggesting that their retinol uptake was increased in RBP4-expressing brown adipocytes when fed a chow diet. These findings reveal a critical role for RBP4 in canonical adrenergic signaling that promotes lipid mobilization and oxidation in brown adipocytes, where the harnessed energy is dissipated as heat by adaptive thermogenesis. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218937908,Thermogenin

Although TM4SF5 also promotes migration and invasion, it remains unclear how the metabolic context affects metastatic potential. Here we explored how TM4SF5 affects albumin uptake for HCC progression using TM4SF5 knockout or reintroduced hepatocyte and animal systems. Serum-deprived hepatocytes formed filopodia-like processes depending on TM4SF5 expression, which was altered by albumin replenishment for membranous PIP3-dependent macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis required nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (NCOA3) stabilized in the cytosol and PTEN inactivation via binding to TM4SF5WT. TM4SF5-mediated albumin uptake led to ATP-linked respiration and cellular migration. Tumor tissues from liver-orthotopically xenografted mice fed a high protein diet or human liver cancer tissues showed TM4SF5-dependent macropinocytosis and NCOA3-correlated metastatic features, unlike mice fed a normal chow diet or human nontumor regions. These observations indicate that serum albumin availability to TM4SF5-positive HCC could support multifocality and intrahepatic metastasis, which may provide insights into clinical observations of multiple small tumor nodules surrounded by areas with high serum albumin levels.

The main purpose was to compare, in subjects living with obesity (OB) and normal-weight subjects (NW), the characteristics of gustatory evoked potentials (GEP) for sucrose solution (10 g.100 mL−1) before and after a standard lunch. The secondary objective was to evaluate the correlations between GEP and the plasmatic levels of acylated ghrelin, leptin, insulin and serotonin. Methods: Each subject had 2 randomized sessions spaced by an interval of 2 days. During one session, subjects were fasting and during the other, subjects took a lunch low in sugar. In each session, subjects had a blood test before a first GEP recording followed by a second GEP recording either after a lunch (feeding session) or no lunch (fasting session). Results: Twenty-eight OB (BMI: 38.6 ± 9.0 kg.m−2) were matched to 22 NW (BMI: 22.3 ± 2.2 kg.m−2). GEP latencies were prolonged in OB regardless the sessions and the time before and after lunch, compared with NW (in Cz at the morning: 170 ± 33 ms vs 138 ± 25 ms respectively; p < 0.001). The increase in latency observed in NW after lunch was not observed in OB. Negative or positive correlations were noted in all participants between GEP latencies and ghrelin, leptin, insulin plasmatic levels (P1Cz, r = −0.38, r = 0.33, r = 0.37 respectively, p < 0.0001).

We examined how body composition, measured from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and common measures of adiposity (e.g., body mass index (BMI)), are related to hormone concentrations in men from the UK Biobank study. Methods: Up to 16,237 men with available body composition data (including visceral, subcutaneous, and liver fat, muscle fat infiltration (MFI), lean tissue, and common adiposity measures) and serum hormone measurements (insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and calculated free testosterone) were included. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were used to determine the geometric mean hormone and SHBG concentrations across categories of each exposure. Results: Common measurements of adiposity were highly correlated with MRI measures of central and total adiposity (r = 0.76–0.91), although correlations with ectopic fat (liver fat and MFI) were lower (r = 0.43–0.54). Most adiposity measurements showed an inverse U- or J-shaped association with circulating IGF-I and free testosterone; however, MFI was linearly inversely associated, and lean tissue volume was positively associated with both IGF-I and free testosterone concentrations. All body composition measures were inversely associated with total testosterone and SHBG concentrations (relative geometric mean difference between Q5 vs. Q1: 20–30%). Conclusion: Our results show that common adiposity and most MRI measures of adiposity relate similarly to serum hormone concentrations; however, associations with ectopic fat (particularly MFI) and lean tissue were different. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207024096,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: In a retrospective cohort study using UK Biobank data, participants recalled childhood maltreatment. Linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the associations with body mass index (BMI), obesity, and T2D, adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Decomposition analysis was used to examine the extent to which T2D excess risk was attributed to BMI. Results: Of the 153,601 participants who completed the childhood maltreatment questions, one-third reported some form of maltreatment. Prevalence of adult obesity and incidence of T2D were higher with the number of reported childhood maltreatment types. People who reported ≥3 types of childhood maltreatment were at higher risk of obesity (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.47–1.63) and incident T2D (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.52–1.80). Excess T2D risk among those reporting maltreatment could be reduced by 39% if their BMI was comparable to participants who had not been maltreated, assuming causality. Conclusions: People who recalled maltreatment in childhood are at higher risk of T2D in adulthood, partly due to obesity. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207309960,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: Clinical measures included serum glucose, insulin, adipokines, blood pressure and anthropometric measures. MS was determined using the Harmonized criteria. The final sample included 2087 adults. Results: After adjusting for age, sex, and fat mass, L/A ratio, unlike HOMA-IR, was significantly associated with MS across all sites (p < 0.001). Within sites, L/A ratio was only associated with MS and HOMA-IR in the US (p < 0.001) and South Africa (p < 0.01), respectively. Leptin was associated with MS in South Africa only (p < 0.05) but was significantly associated with HOMA-IR across all five sites and within the US (p < 0.05). Similarly, adiponectin was associated with HOMA-IR in South Africa (p < 0.05) and with MS across all five sites (p < 0.001) and within each site separately, except Ghana. Conclusions: Our study suggests that individuals of the African diaspora in different geographical locations may differ in the determinants of MS.

Methods: Skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue samples of 10 controls and 38 people with obesity (50% also with type 2 diabetes) undergoing bariatric surgery were collected. miRNA expression profiles were analyzed using Next-Generation Sequencing and subsequently validated using RT-PCR. Results: Approximately 69% of miRNAs showed similar expression in both tissues, however, 55 miRNAs were preferentially expressed in visceral adipose tissue and 53 in skeletal muscle. miR-122b-5p was uniquely identified in skeletal muscle, while miR-1-3p and miR-206 were upregulated in skeletal muscle. Conversely, miR-224-5p and miR-335-3p exhibited upregulation in visceral adipose tissue. Notably, distinctions related to the presence of type 2 diabetes were observed solely in the expression of miR-1-3p and miR-206 in visceral adipose tissue. Conclusions: This is the first study unveiling distinct miRNA expression profiles in paired samples of visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in humans. The identification of obesity-specific miRNAs in these tissues opens up promising avenues for research into potential biomarkers for obesity diagnosis and treatment. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209564192,Muscle tissue

Moreover, Fas expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) correlates positively with body mass index (BMI) in humans. However, molecular pathways involved in the inhibitory effect of Fas on energy metabolism remain incompletely understood. Herein, we report that protein levels of the tumor suppressor p53 were reduced in primary white adipocytes of adipocyte-specific Fas-knockout mice. Moreover, Fas ligand (FasL) treatment increased p53 concentrations in cultured adipocytes and decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption in control but not in p53-depleted cells, indicating that Fas activation reduces energy expenditure in a p53-dependent manner. In line, in differentiated human mesenchymal stem cells and WAT derived from different anatomical depots, FAS expression was positively associated with p53. Furthermore, p53 expression in human subcutaneous and visceral WAT correlated positively with BMI, whereas its expression in visceral WAT was inversely associated with insulin sensitivity (as assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp). Taken together, our data suggest that Fas regulates p53 expression in adipocytes, and may thereby affect body weight gain and insulin sensitivity. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211181329,Fas ligand

Participants were assigned to a Pathogenic Variant or No Pathogenic Variant group and completed a 10-timepoint 180-min oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and abdominal MRI. Results: Compared to the No Pathogenic Variant group, the Pathogenic Variant group demonstrated significantly greater glucose concentrations (AUCtot: 24.7 ± 1.22 g/dL × 180 min vs. 21.9 ± 1.41 g/dL × 180 min; p = 0.001), insulin levels (AUCtot: 57.4 ± 11.5 mU/mL × 180 min vs. 35.5 ± 8.90 mU/mL × 180 min; p = 0.002), and lower insulin sensitivity (WBISI: 1.01 ± 0.137 vs. 1.85 ± 0.036; p = 0.0008) during the OGTT.

This study aims to explore the role and regulatory mechanism of tricellulin in the development of salivary gland hypofunction in Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). Employing a multifaceted approach involving patient biopsies, non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice as a SS model, salivary gland acinar cell-specific tricellulin conditional knockout (TricCKO) mice, and IFN-γ-stimulated salivary gland epithelial cells, we investigated the role of tricellulin in SS-related hyposalivation. Our data revealed diminished levels of tricellulin in salivary glands of SS patients. Similarly, NOD mice displayed a reduction in tricellulin expression from the onset of the disease, concomitant with hyposecretion and an increase in salivary albumin content. Consistent with these findings, TricCKO mice exhibited both hyposecretion and leakage of macromolecular tracers when compared to control animals. Mechanistically, the JAK/STAT1/miR-145 axis was identified as mediating the IFN-γ-induced downregulation of tricellulin. Treatment with AT1001, a TJ sealer, ameliorated epithelial barrier dysfunction, restored tricellulin expression, and consequently alleviated hyposalivation in NOD mice. Importantly, treatment with miR-145 antagomir to specifically recover the expression of tricellulin in NOD mice significantly alleviated hyposalivation and macromolecular leakage. Collectively, we identified that tricellulin deficiency in salivary glands contributed to hyposalivation in SS. Our findings highlight tricellulin as a potential therapeutic target for hyposecretion, particularly in the context of reinforcing epithelial barrier function through preventing leakage of macromolecules in salivary glands. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000397008,NOD mice

The physical and demographic characteristics of the 40 patients with hypertension were collected with sociodemographic form. Waist/hip circumference was measured with tape measure and epicardial adipose tissue thickness with echocardiography device. Physical activity levels and sedentary time were recorded via IPAQ-7. Physical performance was determined using the 30-s sit-and-stand test. There was a moderate negative correlation between epicardial adipose tissue thickness and IPAQ-7 score (rho: −0.568 p < 0.001) and a high negative correlation between epicardial adipose tissue thickness and sit-and-stand test score (rho: −0.794 p < 0.001).

So far, it remains unknown whether expression of these antigens on MC is of prognostic significance in SM. We performed a retrospective multi-center study of patients with SM using the data set of the registry of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis, including 5034 patients with various MC disorders. The percentage of CD2-, CD25+ and/or CD30+ MC was considerably lower in patients with indolent SM compared to patients with advanced SM, including aggressive SM and MC leukemia. Whereas CD25 and CD30 expression in MC could not be associated with prognosis, we found that lack of CD2 expression in MC is associated with a significantly reduced overall survival (OS) in patients with SM (p < 0.0001). Lack of CD2 was also associated with the presence of extramedullary involvement affecting the spleen, liver, and/or lymph nodes (odds ratio 2.63 compared to SM with CD2+ MC). Together, lack of CD2 expression in MC is a prognostic marker and indicator of reduced OS and extramedullary disease expansion in patients with SM.

Chromosomal alterations are frequent in MDS, with interstitial deletion of chromosome 5q (del(5q)) being the most common. Lenalidomide is the current first-line treatment for del(5q) MDS and its efficacy relies on degradation of CK1α which is encoded by the CSNK1A1 gene located in the commonly deleted region (CDR) of chromosome 5q. However, lenalidomide-resistance is common, often secondary to loss-of-function mutations in TP53 or RUNX1. The CDR in del(5q) harbors several genes, including noncoding miRNAs, the loss of which contribute to disease phenotypes. miR-143 and miR-145 are located within the del(5q) CDR, but precise understanding of their role in human hematopoiesis and in the pathogenesis of del(5q) MDS is lacking. Here we provide evidence that deficiency of miR-143 and miR-145 plays a role in clonal expansion of del(5q) MDS. We show that insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a direct target of both miR-143 and miR-145. Our data demonstrate that IGF-1R inhibition reduces proliferation and viability of del(5q) cells in vitro and in vivo, and that lenalidomide-resistant del(5q) MDS cells depleted of either TP53 or RUNX1 are sensitive to IGF-1R inhibition. Resistant del(5q) MDS-L cells, as well as primary MDS marrow cells, are also sensitive to targeting of IGF-1R-related dependencies in del(5q) MDS, which include the Abl and MAPK signaling pathways. This work thus provides potential new therapeutic avenues for lenalidomide-resistant del(5q) MDS. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218900540,Haploinsufficiency; Hematology; Neoplasm
Tomsa D.; Liu Y.; Stefanson A.; Ren X.; Sokoro A.A.H.; Komenda P.; Tangri N.; Zahedi R.P.; Rigatto C.; Lin F.,A passive flow microreactor for urine creatinine test,2025,Microsystems and Nanoengineering,10.1038/s41378-025-00880-z,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) significantly affects people’s health and quality of life and presents a high economic burden worldwide. There are well-established biomarkers for CKD diagnosis. However, the existing routine standard tests are lab-based and governed by strict regulations. Creatinine is commonly measured as a filtration biomarker in blood to determine estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), as well as a normalization factor to calculate urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (uACR) for CKD evaluation. In this study, we developed a passive flow microreactor for colorimetric urine creatinine measurement (uCR-Chip), which is highly amenable to integration with our previously developed microfluidic urine albumin assay. The combination of the 2-phase pressure compensation (2-PPC) technique and microfluidic channel network design accurately controls the fluidic mixing ratio and chemical reaction. Together with an optimized observation window (OW) design, a uniform and stable detection signal was achieved within 7 min. The color signal was measured by a simple USB microscope-based platform to quantify creatinine concentration in the sample. The combination of the custom in-house photomask production techniques and dry-film photoresist-based lithography enabled rapid iterative design optimization and precise chip fabrication. The developed assay achieved a dynamic linear detection range up to 40 mM and a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 0.521 mM, meeting the clinical precision requirements (comparable to existing point-of-care (PoC) systems). The microreactor was validated using creatinine standards spiked into commercial artificial urine that mimics physiological matrix. Our results showed acceptable recovery rate and low matrix effect, especially for the low creatinine concentration range in comparison to a commercial PoC uACR test. Altogether, the developed uCR-Chip offers a viable PoC test for CKD assessment and provides a potential platform technology to measure various disease biomarkers.

Over time, various strategies and platforms have been introduced to improve CD4+ cell enumeration, aiming to enhance the performance of diagnostic devices and bring the service closer to patients. These advancements are particularly critical for low-resource settings and point-of-care applications, where the excellent performance of flow cytometry is hindered by its unsuitability in such environments. This work presents an innovative electrochemical microfluidic device that, with further development, could be applied for HIV management in low resource settings. The setup integrates an electrochemical sensor within a PDMS microfluidic structure, allowing for on-chip electrode functionalization and cell detection. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the biosensor demonstrates a linear detection range from 1.25 × 105 to 2 × 106 cells/mL, with a detection limit of 1.41 × 105 cells/mL for CD4+ cells isolated from blood samples, aligning with clinical ranges for both healthy and HIV+ patients. The biosensor shows specificity towards CD4+ cells with negligible response to monocytes, neutrophils, and bovine serum albumin. Its integration with a microfluidic chip for sensor fabrication and cell detection, compact size, minimal manual handling, ease of fabrication, electrochemical detection capability, and potential for multiplexing together with the detection range make the device particularly advantageous for use in low-resource settings, standing out among other devices described in the literature. This study also investigates the integration of a microfluidic Dean Flow Fractionation (DFF) chip for cell separation.

Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) functions as a part of complex opioid system and supports both homeostatic and hedonic control of eating behavior. Thirteen patients with AN and thirteen healthy controls (HC) were included in this study. We measured (1) MOR availability with [11C]carfentanil positron emission tomography (PET), (2) brain glucose uptake (BGU) with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and (3) blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal with functional magnetic resonance imaging. All subjects underwent a screening visit consisting of physical examination, anthropometric measurements, fasting blood samples, an oral glucose tolerance test, psychiatric assessment, and an inquiry regarding medical history. Body fat mass (%) was measured and M value was calculated. MOR availability from caudate and putamen was higher in patients with AN and those from nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and thalamus showed the higher trend in patients with AN. There was no area where MOR availability was lower in patients with AN. BGU was not different between AN and HC. MOR availability and BGU were negatively correlated in caudate, NAcc and thalamus and showed the trend of negative association in putamen. In conclusion, AN is associated with higher MOR availability in the brain regions implicated in reward processing, while BGU remains unaltered. Therefore, the endogenous opioid system might be one of the key components underlying AN. This better understanding of AN could support the development of new treatments for AN. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217179415,Anorexia nervosa; μ-opioid receptor

The aim of our design was to evaluate the effects of rs2282679 genetic variant of CG gene on 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, weight loss and metabolic parameters after a robotic sleeve gastrectomy in premenopausal females with obesity. Methods: 76 participants were enrolled. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, biochemical evaluation and anthropometric parameters were registered before surgery and after 3, 6 and 12 months follow up. Genotype of rs2282679 CG gene was evaluated. Results: The improvements in anthropometric parameters, blood pressure and lipid profile were similar in both genotypes (TT vs TG + GG). Basal insulin levels and HOMA-IR were greater in G allele carriers than non-carriers (Delta: 6.7 ± 1.2 mUI/L; p = 0.01) and (Delta: 1.3 ± 0.1 units; p = 0.02). 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were lower in G allele carriers than non-carriers (Delta: 8.1 ± 1.1 ng/dl; p = 0.03). The levels of insulin and HOMA-IR remained greater in G allele carriers than non-carriers throughout all the visits. The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D remained lower in G allele carriers than non-G allele. The average level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D at 12 months in non-G allele carriers were above 30 ng/dl (36.0 ± 3.1 ng/dl) and the level in G allele carriers were below (24.9 ± 4.9 ng/dl). Conclusions: rs 2282679 (GC) was related with low 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels and insulin resistance. In addition, the presence of G allele produced a decrease in the improvement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and insulin resistance after weight loss during 12 months. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189357944,Sleeve gastrectomy

However, the potential metabolic factors, including insulin resistance, remain unclear. This study longitudinally investigated factors associated with changes in body weight. Subjects: A cohort of 707 adults without diabetes were investigated at the 4-year follow-up visit. The habitual intake of energy and macronutrients during the past 12 months was assessed using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire for the local population. Homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used as a surrogate measure of insulin resistance. Additionally, PNPLA3 was genotyped. Results: Eighty-seven participants were weight gainers (G; cutoff value = 5 kg), and 620 were non-gainers (NG). Initial anthropometric (G vs. NG: age, 44 ± 13 vs 51 ± 13 years, P < 0.001; body mass index, 27.8 ± 6.5 vs 28.1 ± 5.1 kg/m2, P = ns; body weight, 76.7 ± 22.1 vs 74.2 ± 14.7 kg, P = ns; final body weight, 86.3 ± 23.7 vs 72.9 ± 14.2 kg, P < 0.001) and diet characteristics, as well as insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR values, were similar in both groups. Four years later, G showed significantly increased EI, insulin concentrations, and HOMA-IR values. G had a higher prevalence of the PNPLA3 CG and GG alleles than NG (P < 0.05). The presence of G was independently associated with age (OR = 1.031), EI change (OR = 2.257), and unfavorable alleles of PNPLA3 gene (OR = 1.700). Final body mass index, waist circumference, and EI were independently associated with final HOMA-IR (P < 0.001). Conclusions: EI is associated with body weight gain, and genetic factors may influence the energy balance. Insulin resistance is a consequence of weight gain, suggesting a possible intracellular protective mechanism against substrate overflow.

Carrageenan is composed of sulfated or unsulfated galactose residues linked in alternating alpha-1,3 and beta-1,4 bonds and resembles the endogenous sulfated glycosaminoglycans. However, carrageenan has unusual alpha-1,3-galactosidic bonds, which are not innate to human cells and are implicated in immune responses. Exposure to carrageenan predictably causes inflammation, and carrageenan impairs glucose tolerance and contributes to insulin resistance. When cultured human L-cells were deprived overnight of glucose and serum and then exposed to high glucose, 10% FBS, and λ-carrageenan (1 µg/ml) for 10 minutes, 1 h, and 24 h, mRNA expression of proglucagon and secretion of GLP-1 were significantly reduced, compared to control cells not exposed to carrageenan. mRNA expression of proglucagon by mouse L-cells (STC-1) was also significantly reduced and supports the findings in the human cells. Exposure of co-cultured human intestinal epithelial cells (LS174T) to the spent media of the carrageenan-treated L-cells led to a decline in mRNA expression of GLUT-2 at 24 h. These findings suggest that ingestion of carrageenan-containing processed foods may impair the production of GLP-1, counteract the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists and induce secondary effects on intestinal epithelial cells. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193507586,Carrageenan; Enteroendocrine cell; Proglucagon

We aimed to evaluate the effects of forced acute lifestyle changes on NAFLD evolution. Methods: 187 NAFLD patients were followed two years pre- and two years during the lockdown social restrictions in three Italian medical centers. For each patient, biochemical, clinical, non-invasive liver fibrosis, nutritional, and body composition data were collected. Results: An increase in fats and carbohydrate intake associated with impaired weekly physical activity during the lockdown was demonstrated as well as an increase in body mass index and waist-hip-ratio (p < 0.0001 for all). Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, and transaminases worsened during the lockdown (glucose: p = 0.0007; p < 0.0001 for the others). Moreover, NAFLD fibrosis score, liver stiffness, and controlled attenuation parameter were also impaired during the same period (p < 0.0001 for all). The bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) evidenced an increase of fat mass (FM), and a reduction of free fat mass (FFM) and body cell mass (BCM) (p < 0.0001 for all). The lockdown overall hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Milan-out HCC occurrence revealed Hazard Ratio (HR): 2.398, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):1.16–5, p = 0.02, and HR:5.931, CI:2–17.6, p = 0.008 respectively. A liver disease stage and comorbidities independent association between both the assessed outcomes and body composition analysis in terms of mean values and variation (T1–T2 Δ) was demonstrated. Conclusions: The acute lifestyle changes impacted NAFLD evolution via body composition modifications negatively influencing the HCC occurrence.

Thus, we investigated the effects of insulin resistance (IR), and blood glucose fluctuations on cognitive function under laboratory and free-living conditions, using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Subjects/methods: Baseline assessments included neuropsychological tests and blood analysis. Individuals were classified as either insulin-sensitive (<2) or insulin-resistant (≥2), based on their Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) values. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using a percutaneous sensor was performed for 1 week. Using multiple linear regression, we examined the effects of HOMA-IR and CGM metrics on cognitive domains. Working memory (WM) performance, which was assessed using EMA, 4 times a day for 3 consecutive days, was matched to short-term pre-task CGM metrics. Multilevel analysis was used to map the within-day associations of HOMA-IR, short-term CGM metrics, and WM. Results: Analyses included 110 individuals (mean age 48.7 ± 14.3 years, 59% female, n = 53 insulin-resistant). IR was associated with lower global cognitive function (b = −0.267, P = 0.027), and WM (b = −0.316; P = 0.029), but not with executive function (b = −0.216; P = 0.154) during baseline. EMA showed that higher HOMA-IR was associated with lower within-day WM performance (β = −0.20, 95% CI −0.40 to −0.00). CGM metrics were not associated with cognitive performance. Conclusions: The results confirm the association between IR and decrements in global cognitive functioning and WM, while no effects of CGM metrics were observed, making IR a crucial time point for intervention. Targeting underlying mechanisms (e.g., inflammation) in addition to glycemia could be promising to minimize adverse cognitive effects. Registered under https://drks.de/register/de identifier no.

Several recent works have suggested cis-vaccenic acid (cVA) in plasma lipid compartments, especially in plasma phospholipids (PL) or erythrocyte membranes, could be associated with markers of insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular health. Nevertheless, not all the results of research work testify to these beneficial effects of cVA. Therefore, we decided to investigate the relations of proportion of cVA in plasma PL to markers of insulin resistance in hyperlipidemic men. Subjects: In 231 men (median age 50) with newly diagnosed hyperlipidemia, we analyzed basic clinical parameters together with FA composition of plasma PL and stratified them according to the content of cVA into upper quartile (Q4) and lower quartile (Q1) groups. We examined also small control group of 50 healthy men. Results: The individuals in Q4 differed from Q1 by lower plasma insulin (p < 0.05), HOMA-IR values (p < 0.01), and apolipoprotein B concentrations (p < 0.001), but by the higher total level of nonesterified FA (p < 0.01). Both groups had similar age, anthropometrical, and other lipid parameters. In plasma PL, the Q4 group had lower content of the sum of n-6 polyunsaturated FA, due to decrease of γ-linolenic and dihomo-γ-linolenic acids, whereas the content of monounsaturated FA (mainly oleic and palmitoleic) was in Q4 higher. Conclusions: Our results support hypothesis that plasma PL cVA could be associated with insulin sensitivity in men with hyperlipidemia.

Methods: In this secondary analysis, we used data from the MARCH trial, which was designed to compare the efficacy of acarbose or metformin monotherapy as the initial therapy in Chinese patients newly diagnosed with T2DM. Dietary data were obtained using a 24-h dietary recall method to evaluate the intakes of dietary fiber from different sources as well as the carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio. Results: A total of 551 newly-diagnosed patients with T2DM complete dietary records (286 in the acarbose group and 265 in the metformin group) were included. Higher intake of total fiber and whole grain fiber was positively associated with better β‐cell function, insulin sensitivity and postprandial glycemic control under acarbose treatment. Higher intake of legume fiber was associated with better glycemic control under both acarbose and metformin treatment but with better weight loss only under metformin treatment. A high-carbohydrate–low-fiber diet was associated with worse glycemic control and lower HDL-C under acarbose treatment but with higher insulin sensitivity and better weight loss under metformin treatment. Conclusions: The notable effects of various dietary fibers when combined with different oral glucose-lowering medications should be considered to maximize therapeutic benefit. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205527095,Acarbose

Methods: An acute, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial was carried out on T2DM patients. The subjects were randomly assigned to groups consuming placebo black tea powder or BTID (identically packaged) followed by a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Afterwards, individuals who initially consumed BTID were given the placebo and those who initially consumed the placebo were given BTID. Results: A total of 35 patients were included in the study, and 32 completed the study. Compared to placebo, BTID significantly reduced the change in glycaemia at 30 min, 1, 2, and 3 h during the MMTT. In the analysis of PG fluctuations at 2 h during the MMTT, the proportion of patients with minor PG fluctuations (< 2.8 mmol/L) in the BTID group was 53.1%, significantly higher than the 28.1% in the placebo group. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk of significant PG fluctuations decreased by 65.5% after consuming BTID, with a corresponding odds ratio of 0.345 (P = 0.044, 95% CI 0.122–0.974). In addition, the areas under the curve for PG and insulin secretion after BTID administration were significantly smaller than that for placebo. Conclusions: Compared to placebo, BTID significantly reduced the change in PG levels during the MMTT and decreased the risk of large PG fluctuations by 65.5%. These effects were associated to a significant reduction in postprandial insulin secretion and may help to improved insulin sensitivity and a lower β-cell burden. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211162389,Crossover study

Meng W.; Li L.,ZHX2 inhibits diabetes-induced liver injury and ferroptosis by epigenetic silence of YTHDF2,2025,Nutrition and Diabetes,10.1038/s41387-025-00355-0,"Objective: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The transcription factor zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases, yet its precise role and underlying mechanism in DM-induced hepatic injury remain poorly elucidated. Methods: To investigate this, we used a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) administration to create a DM model in mice, while high glucose (HG) exposure was used to simulate DM in vitro. Through various experiments such as luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, RNA immunoprecipitation, and rescue experiments, we aimed to uncover the mechanisms involving ZHX2. Results: Our findings revealed that ZHX2 was lower and YTHDF2 was higher in the livers of DM mice and HG-induced Huh7 cells. ZHX2 overexpression rescued DM-induced liver injury. ZHX2 overexpression also reversed DM-induced hepatic ferroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, YTHDF2 recognized m6A-modified ZHX2 mRNA and promoted its degradation. In turn, ZHX2 inhibited the transcription of YTHDF2 by binding to its promoter region. Knockdown of ZHX2 led to increased ferroptosis in Huh7 cells through activating YTHDF2-induced GPX4 and SLC7A11 degradation. Conclusion: These findings highlight the involvement of the ZHX2-YTHDF2-ferroptosis pathway in DM-induced liver injury and suggest that targeting this pathway may hold therapeutic potential for improving such injuries.

Although polyols affect glycometabolism, little is known about the association between fasting serum polyol levels of participants with habitual diet and the risk of prediabetes progressing to type 2 diabetes. Methods: In this nested case-control study, 180 participants who developed from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes (progressors), and 180 matched controls (non-progressors) with prediabetes during a 3.5-year follow-up were enrolled. The baseline levels of serum polyols in the fasting state were quantified using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to assess the effects of the differential polyol levels on the risk of incident diabetes from prediabetes. Results: The baseline fasting xylitol levels, but not sorbitol or erythritol levels, were higher in non-progressors than in progressors (P < 0.001). Non-progressors, in comparison with progressors, had significantly higher proportions within the third tertile of xylitol levels (71/180 non-progressors [39.4%] vs. 49/180 progressors [27.2%]). After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratio of risk for incident diabetes in the highest tertile of xylitol levels was 0.338 (95% confidence interval 0.182–0.628), when compared with those in the lowest tertile. In addition, the association between xylitol levels and incident diabetes was persistent in those with fasting hyperglycemia and both fasting and 2h-post-glucose-load hyperglycemia, but not in the isolated 2h-post-glucose-load hyperglycemia. Conclusions: Elevated baseline fasting serum xylitol levels are associated with a lower risk of prediabetes progressing to diabetes. This association was particularly evident in those with fasting hyperglycemia. These findings suggest that fasting serum xylitol levels may serve as an important predictor and protective factor against the development of diabetes. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218196601,Impaired fasting glucose; Prediabetes
Deng Y.; Luo Y.; Shen Y.; Zhao Y.; Cao W.; Cao J.; Xu L.; Kong L.,"Associations between hypovitaminosis D, adiposity indices and insulin resistance in adolescents: mediation analyses from NHANES 2011–2018",2025,Nutrition and Diabetes,10.1038/s41387-025-00358-x,"Background: As all kown, both hypovitaminosis D and insulin resistance (IR) have been linked to adiposity. However, the extent of adiposity’s mediating influence on the hypovitaminosis D-IR relationship among adolescents remains to be elucidated. Additionally, the intricate effects of obesity and blood lipid profiles on IR are not yet fully understood. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of NHANES data from 2011 to 2018, examining the correlation between adiposity indices such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Fat Mass Index (FMI, defined as the ratio of fat mass to height squared), hypovitaminosis D, and IR. We employed the XGBoost algorithm to identify key factors significantly influencing IR, thereby deepening our insight into the link between adiposity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, we applied mediation analysis to precisely assess the mediating role of adiposity indices in the relationship between hypovitaminosis D and IR. Results: Our study revealing significant correlations between adiposity indices, hypovitaminosis D, and IR after variable adjustment. Notably, subgroup analysis indicated a pronounced hypovitaminosis D -adiposity association in female adolescents, which was not observed in males. The XGBoost algorithm pinpointed obesity and blood lipid indicators significantly affecting IR, with total fat mass, triglyceride, cholesterol, BMI, and FMI ranked by descending importance. Mediation analysis disclosed that adiposity indices mediate a substantial portion of the hypovitaminosis D -IR relationship, with FMI (43.84%, p < 0.001) and BMI (40.87%, p < 0.001) showing significant mediating effects. Conclusion: The study confirmed significant correlations between adiposity indices, hypovitaminosis D, and IR in adolescents, with gender-specific differences in the hypovitaminosis D -adiposity link. Cholesterol was found to have a more substantial influence on IR than BMI and FMI. Furthermore, FMI was identified as a more potent mediator of the hypovitaminosis D-IR relationship compared to BMI, highlighting its importance in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in adolescents. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218041934,Hypovitaminosis

To comprehensively explore the neural mechanisms underlying it, we aimed to explore the sequence that episodic memory-related behavioral and brain-imaging biomarkers appear abnormal in the progression of T2D. Methods: We enrolled 62 healthy controls and 110 patients with T2D. The California Verbal Learning Test, Montreal cognitive assessment, and Stroop color word test was used to assess the episodic memory, general cognitive function, and executive function. Principal component analysis was applied to extract behavioral biomarkers. Imaging biomarkers included structural and functional MRI features of the entorhinal cortex-hippocampus and hippocampus-anterior cingulate cortex pathways. We used a novel discriminative event-based model to determine the sequence that memory-related biomarkers appear abnormal and estimate the stage of memory decline. Results: T2D patients exhibited poorer memory, general cognitive function, and executive function compared to healthy controls after controlling age, sex, and education level. In the progression of T2D, functional interaction between brain regions showed abnormalities first, followed by memory tests, the cerebral spontaneous neural activity, and finally the gray matter volume. Besides, abnormalities appeared earlier in the entorhinal cortex than in the anterior cingulate cortex. Later stage of memory decline was distributed in older patients with T2D and was associated with higher systolic blood pressure, postprandial blood glucose, and low-density lipoprotein. Conclusions: In T2D, behavioral and brain imaging biomarkers of episodic memory appear abnormal in a specific sequence, and the stage of memory decline was closely associated with old age and vascular risk factors.

Methods: We employed weighted multivariable-adjusted logistic regression to assess the relationship between ApoB and DN risk, utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey spanning 2007–2016. Then, we used restricted cubic splines (RCS) to flexibly model and visualize the relation of predicted ApoB levels with DN risk. Subsequently, a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study using genome-wide association study summary statistics was performed. The primary Inverse Variance Weighted method, along with supplementary MR approaches, was employed to verify the causal link between ApoB and DN. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to confirm the robustness of the results. Results: Our observational study enrolled 2242 participants with diabetes mellitus from NHANES. The multivariable logistic regression model indicated that elevated ApoB levels (>1.2 g/L), compared to low levels (<0.8 g/L), were significantly associated with DN risk (P < 0.05). The RCS model revealed a positive linear association with the risk of DN when ApoB levels exceeded 1.12 g/L (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07–1.57, P = 0.008). However, the MR IVW method did not reveal a direct causal effect of DN on ApoB (OR: 0.976; 95% CI: 0.950–1.004; P = 0.095), nor a direct causal effect of ApoB on DN (OR: 0.837; 95% CI: 0.950–1.078; P = 0.428). Conclusion: The evidence from observational studies indicates a positive correlation between ApoB levels exceeding 1.12 g/L and the onset of DN. However, the causal effects of ApoB on DN and vice versa were not supported by the MR analysis. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005414919,Association (psychology); Mendelian Randomization

Methods: In this 8-week randomized controlled clinical trial, 90 patients with T2DM who were experiencing mild to moderate depression were included. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (i) acupuncture combined with an anti-inflammatory diet, (ii) an anti-inflammatory diet alone, and (iii) standard treatment. The combination therapy group received acupuncture therapy twice a week. Mental health outcomes, biochemical parameters, dietary intake, and anthropometric indices were assessed at baseline and the end of the trial. Results: Of the 90 diabetic patients, 83 completed the intervention. Acupuncture therapy combined with diet resulted in an ~20% reduction in depression and anxiety, 4.28 and 0.82% reduction in waist circumference (WC) and HbA1C levels, respectively at the end of the trial. This combination therapy also significantly decreased WC (p = 0.04) and HbA1c levels (p = 0.008), while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (p = 0.02) compared to diet alone. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that acupuncture, in conjunction with an anti-inflammatory diet, may be more effective in enhancing mental health, reducing HbA1C levels, and decreasing abdominal obesity compared to an anti-inflammatory diet alone in patients with T2DM experiencing mild-to-moderate depression after 8 weeks. However, further clinical trials with larger sample sizes and extended durations are recommended to confirm the efficacy of this adjunctive therapy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003964643,Depression

This study reports T1D burden among adolescents and young adults aged 10–24-year-old age group at global, regional, and national levels. Methods: Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, we described the burden of T1D in the 10–24-year-old age group. We further analyzed these trends by age, sex, and the Social Development Index. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to assess temporal trends. Results: T1D incidence among adolescents and young adults increased from 7·78 per 100,000 population (95% UI, 5·27–10·60) in 1990 to 11·07 per 100,000 population (95% UI, 7·42–15·34) in 2019. T1D mortality increased from 5701·19 (95% UI, 4642·70–6444·08) in 1990 to 6,123·04 (95% UI, 5321·82–6887·08) in 2019, representing a 7·40% increase in mortality. The European region had the highest T1D incidence in 2019. Middle-SDI countries exhibited the largest increase in T1D incidence between 1990 and 2019. Conclusion: T1D is a growing health concern globally, and T1D burden more heavily affects countries with low SDI. Specific measures and effective collaboration among countries with different SDIs are required to improve diabetes care in adolescents. Impact: We assessed trends in T1D incidence and burden among youth in the 10–24-year-old age group by evaluating data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Our results demonstrated that global T1D incidence in this age group increased over the past 30 years, with the European region having the highest T1D incidence.

This review aims to elucidate the intricate association between EAT and childhood T1D. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, two pediatric groups were involved children with type 1 diabetes, and healthy children. Epicardial fat thickness was measured appropriately, and the study documented HbA1c levels and time to diabetes diagnosis for comprehensive analysis. Results: Encompassing 51 children with T1D and 69 healthy controls, revealed that children with type 1 diabetes had a mean HbA1c level of 9.4 ± 0.2, and a mean insulin dose of 0.94 units/kg/day. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) values were significantly higher in the Type 1 DM group. It has been shown that epicardial fat thickness may have a specific and sensitive value in type 1 diabetics. Discussion: The increased presence of epicardial fat tissue in children with type 1 diabetes is highlighted, prompting the consideration of various mechanisms. However, the complexity of this relationship underscores the need for further studies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors. Ongoing research in this area is crucial for advancing our knowledge and potential therapeutic interventions. Impacts: Cardiac complications are one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in people with type 1 diabetes. Being able to detect cardiological complications of diabetes at an early stage contributes to morbidity. We found that epicardial fat tissue thickness was thicker in children with type 1 diabetes than in healthy children. Epicardial fat tissue thickness may be associated with poor control in children with type 1 diabetes and maybe a guide in terms of cardiac risks. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196069716,Epicardial Fat; Epicardial adipose tissue

It is not known, however, whether PA effects cognitive development. This longitudinal case-control cohort study aimed: (1) To investigate whether a history of PA leads to measurable changes in adulthood cognitive performance, and (2) to assess whether findings characteristic of PA girls predict adulthood cognitive performance. Methods: Twenty-seven girls with PA and 27 age-matched control girls were examined and followed from mid-childhood (mean age 7.2 years) until early adult age (18.5 years). Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition scores were used as main outcome measure. Results: Allostatic load (AL) scores, which compile multisystem variables to reflect the overall wear and tear of the body from increased and prolonged stress, were higher in the PA group in both prepuberty and adulthood, but there were no differences in WAIS-IV results between the groups (full-scale IQ 92.7 vs. 97.5, p 0.376; no differences in separate indexes). Childhood androgen levels, glucose metabolism biomarkers, and AL scores failed to predict adulthood cognitive performance outcomes. Conclusion: The study suggests that PA does not predispose to adverse adulthood outcomes of cognitive development. Impact: The study suggests that a history of premature adrenarche (PA) does not affect cognitive performance in adult age. Childhood androgen levels and biomarkers of glucose metabolism failed to predict adulthood cognitive outcomes in this study. Allostatic load scores were elevated in the PA group both in childhood and adulthood but did not predict adulthood cognitive outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197727221,Adrenarche; Cognitive skill

Systematic review has shown increased milk quantity with relaxation interventions. We hypothesised that a self-directed audio relaxation and lactation-specific visualisation would increase milk quantity after a very premature birth. Methods: Unmasked, randomised, controlled trial, recruiting 132 participants in four United Kingdom neonatal units. Eligible women had given birth to one or two infants between 23+0 and 31+6 weeks of gestation. The intervention was a 12-min voice recording including breathing exercises, muscle relaxation and lactation-specific visualisation. Primary outcome was the highest 24-h breastmilk weight expressed on any of day 4, day 14 or day 21 after birth. Results: Mean birth gestation was 27.8 weeks (SD 2.4), with 26% of participants giving birth under 26 weeks (34/132). Adjusted mean difference in primary outcome was 73.9 g (95% CI −61.7 to 209.5, p = 0.28). Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index adjusted mean difference was −1.9 (−8.2 to 4.3, p = 0.54). The majority of relaxation group participants felt the intervention was relaxing (32/42, 76%). Conclusions: There was no beneficial effect of this relaxation intervention on milk quantity. Mothers of very premature infants may value relaxation interventions but they are unlikely to have a large effect on milk quantity. Impact: This randomised trial did not show a beneficial effect of a self-directed audio relaxation and visualisation on mothers’ own milk quantity expressed after very preterm birth. Mothers of very and extremely preterm infants may value relaxation interventions, but they are unlikely to have a large effect on milk quantity. Prior systematic review of mixed populations has shown an increase in mothers’ own milk quantity with relaxation interventions. Combining this study with existing meta-analysis could result in a new hypothesis that the lower the gestation at birth, the smaller the impact of relaxation on milk quantity. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205078985,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Zhang Z.; Li Y.; Yang C.; Li Y.,Association between BNP and all-cause mortality in critically ill children: a cohort study,2025,Pediatric Research,10.1038/s41390-024-03666-7,"Background: There is evidence that a high level of BNP is associated with poorer outcomes in patients with cardiac diseases, but few data are available concerning BNP and all-cause mortality in pediatric population. Methods: Using the 2010–2018 pediatric intensive care database, we conducted a retrospective study on patients aged 28 days to 18 years, analyzing post-admission BNP measurements. Through two-piecewise regression to identify inflection points, and multivariable logistic regression, we investigated BNP’s association with all-cause mortality. We also developed a multivariable-adjusted restricted cubic spline model to explore BNP’s non-linear correlation with mortality. Results: In a study of 3220 patients, the overall all-cause mortality rate was 6.7%, with rates across BNP quartiles (Q1–Q4) significantly differing, highlighting a notable increase in mortality at higher BNP levels (P < 0.001). Specifically, patients with BNP ≥ 10,170 pg/ml had an adjusted mortality odds ratio (OR) of 2.017 (95% CI 1.265–3.217; P = 0.0032). Analysis confirmed a non-linear relationship between BNP levels and mortality, with log2 BNP associated with increased risk (OR1.28, 95% CI 1.19–1.38; P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses further revealed that very high BNP levels, especially in infants, with lactate ≥2.0 mmol/L, or CKMB ≥ 45 μ/L. Conclusions: BNP level was associated with all-cause mortality, especially for the patients with BNP ≥ 10,170 pg/ml. Impact: This study explored the non-linear association between BNP levels and all-cause mortality in the PICU, finding a significant association among patients with BNP levels above 10,170 pg/ml. The study revealed that higher BNP levels are associated with increased mortality in critically ill children, including those with non-cardiac diseases. This research provides new data on a Southern Chinese population, previously unstudied, enriching the existing body of knowledge. While most studies have focused on adult cardiac patients, this research highlights the importance of BNP as a prognostic tool in the PICU, including non-cardiac cases, adding to the literature. This study furnishes novel clinical evidence supporting the monitoring of BNP concentrations within the PICU, aiding in prognostic predictions and the development of tailored treatment plans for patients. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207167121,Quartile; Risk of mortality

However, the efficacy and safety of azvudine versus Paxlovid are poorly established. This study included 40,876 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from eleven hospitals in Henan and Xinjiang Provinces, China. Clinical outcomes were compared between the two drugs via Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox regression models. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo experiments were used to evaluate the antitumor effects and safety of both drugs. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate the tumor immune landscape after azvudine treatment. After propensity score matching, 2404 azvudine and 1202 Paxlovid recipients from Henan Province were included. Cox regression revealed that azvudine was related to an 18% lower risk of all-cause death than Paxlovid (95% CI: 0.676–0.987), was not obviously different in composite disease progression. The robustness of the findings was verified by the Xinjiang cohort and three sensitivity analyses. Fewer adverse events were observed in the azvudine group. Subgroup analysis revealed that azvudine provided greater benefits for patients with malignant tumors, significantly reducing both all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.20−0.54) and composite disease progression (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.33−0.88). Furthermore, azvudine can suppress the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by regulating CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells in vivo. These findings suggest that azvudine therapy is not inferior to Paxlovid in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and has fewer adverse effects. Notably, azvudine may offer greater clinical benefit for patients with HCC. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216057174,2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Ritonavir

In the phase 2 NeoSAC trial, patients with early TNBC received six cycles of apatinib, sintilimab, nab-paclitaxel, and carboplatin followed by surgery. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) rate. Specimens collected pre-neoadjuvant therapy and post-surgery were retained for comprehensive analysis of predictive biomarkers and the impact on the tumor microenvironment. Among 34 enrolled patients, 24 achieved pCR (70.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 53.0-85.3), and 79.4% (95% CI, 65.1-93.7) had residual cancer burden 0-I. Imaging evaluation showed 21 complete responses (61.8%) and 13 partial responses (38.2%). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were leukopenia (47%), neutropenia (36%), and thrombocytopenia (24%). The 36-month disease-free survival rate stood at 94.1% with a median follow-up of 39.1 months. Notably, baseline high ImmuneScore, immune cell infiltration, and enrichment of interferon-related pathways correlated with pCR. Comparison of pre-neoadjuvant and post-surgery data revealed that the pCR group treated with this novel regimen exhibited an upregulation of distinct immune cell subsets, thereby activating the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, higher oxeiptosis scores were associated with an increased likelihood of achieving pCR. Following neoadjuvant therapy, the pCR group showed a decrease in oxeiptosis score, whereas the non-pCR group exhibited an increase. Our study suggests that apatinib, sintilimab combined with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy showed a promising clinical activity and manageable safety profile in early TNBC and merits further study.

Herein, we successfully engineer photodynamic gel-bombs (DCM@OPR) capable of penetrating deeply into tumor tissues utilizing the photodynamic-triggered explosive energy and receptor-mediated transcytosis, significantly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of breast cancer. The photodynamic gel-bombs were fabricated by loading powerful components of chlorin e6 and MnO2 nanoparticles, as well as Doxorubicin, into a crosslinked Ca2+-gel. Upon exposure to laser irradiation, the obtained photodynamic gel-bombs are capable of generating explosive energy, resulting in their fragmentation into numerous nanofragments. The photodynamic-triggered explosive energy subsequently drives these nanofragments to deeply penetrate into tumor tissues through gap leakage among tumor cells. In addition, the photodynamic-triggered explosive energy also promotes the escape of those therapeutic components (including chlorin e6, MnO2 nanoparticles, and doxorubicin) and nanofragments from lysosomes. In the subsequent stages, these nanofragments also exhibit excellent transcytosis capacity, facilitating deep penetration into tumor tissues. As expected, the enhanced penetration and accumulation of therapeutic components into tumor tissues can be achieved, significantly enhancing the anti-proliferation capacity against breast cancer. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000340530,Chlorin; Penetration (warfare); Transcytosis

This prospective, single-arm, phase II TREND trial assessed the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and epirubicin/cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment for TNBC (ChiCTR2000035262). The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR), with the secondary endpoints including safety assessment and objective response rate (ORR). ScRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, TCR-seq, cyTOF and WES were performed on pre-treatment and post-treatment samples. Among 53 total enrolled patients, 44 completed the combined neoadjuvant therapy, and 30 of 44 patients (68.18%) achieved pCR. Additionally, 14 out of 44 patients had a complete response (31.82%), with an ORR of 93.18%. The most commonly observed treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were alopecia, nausea and liver injury with 6 cases classified as grade 3 or higher adverse events. Immune response-related pathways, including TNF signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, were enriched in pCR group. Pre-treatment model was identified and construct to predict response to immunotherapy. CDKN1A+ CD8 T lymphocytes were enriched in pCR group after neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Dynamic change of immune-related pathways at an early stage during the neoadjuvant immunotherapy may be associated with the treatment efficacy. In conclusion, neoadjuvant treatment of tislelizumab with nab-paclitaxel and anthracycline-based chemotherapy showed promising clinical activity and was well-tolerated among TNBC patients, without high incidence of TRAEs. These findings provide evidence supporting neoadjuvant tislelizumab with chemotherapy as an effective rational approach for treating TNBC. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006421367,Clinical endpoint; Epirubicin; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Triple-negative breast cancer

Here, we investigate the dynamics changes of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor microenvironment by profiling 132,115 single-cell transcriptomes derived from 51 tissues, including healthy pancreatic tissue, non-metastatic PDAC primary tumors, metastatic primary tumors, and patient-matched liver metastases. The cellular proportion, bio-functional, and interaction between each cell type are carefully characterized. Aberrant copy number variations (CNVs) indicating malignant intensity are identified at chromosomes 7 and 20 of epithelial cells during tumor development. A bio-functional transition of predominant genes from physiology to pancreatic oncogenesis and metastasis is observed. Combinatorial analysis of epithelial cells and immunocytes indicates a gradient loss of immune surveillance during the malignant transformation. By dissecting cellular interaction, we unravel an incremental tumor cell-triggered apoptosis of DCs through molecular pair ANXA1-FPR1/3. Consequently, the activation and infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are dampened progressively. Remarkably, we unveil a novel subtype of stress-response NK cells (strNK), which are characterized by robust proliferation, diminished cytolytic capabilities, and negative immune regulation. Notably, the presence of strNK cells is associated with poor prognosis of PDAC patients, implying a potential pro-tumor function. Taken together, our results not only shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying step-wise evasion of immune surveillance during PDAC tumor development, but also provide a potential strategy for holding back malignant transition by reinforcing DCs’ function. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007553120,Malignant Transformation

Therefore, identifying molecular stemness targets that are involved in tumor growth is crucial for effective treatment. Here, we performed an extensive in vitro and in vivo molecular and functional characterization, revealing the pivotal role of the lysine methyltransferase SET and MYND Domain Containing 3 (SMYD3) in colorectal cancer stem cell (CRC-SC) biology. Specifically, we showed that SMYD3 interacts with and methylates c-MYC at K158 and K163, thereby modulating its transcriptional activity, which is implicated in stemness and colorectal malignancy. Our in vitro data suggest that SMYD3 pharmacological inhibition or its stable genetic ablation affects the clonogenic and self-renewal potential of patient-derived CRC-SCs and organoids by altering their molecular signature. Moreover, we found that SMYD3 stable knock-out or pharmacological inhibition drastically reduces CRC tumorigenicity in vivo and CRC-SC metastatic potential. Overall, our findings identify SMYD3 as a promising therapeutic target acting directly on c-MYC, with potential implications for countering CRC-SC proliferation and metastatic dissemination. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010022600,Clonogenic assay; Targeted Therapy

Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy has shown promise in DLC treatment, but the optimal dosing strategies and dose-dependent therapeutic mechanisms in humans remain unclear, limiting its clinical application. We conducted sequential Phase Ia/Ib trials using a single-arm, dose-escalation design to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MSC therapy in DLC patients while also exploring its immunomodulatory effects and gathering preliminary therapeutic signals. In Phase Ia, four dose cohorts received a single dose of MSCs: 5.0 × 10⁷, 1.0 × 10⁸, 1.5 × 10⁸, and 2.0 × 10⁸ cells. Patients were followed up on Days 3, 7, 14, and 28. Multiomics analyses, including single-cell RNA sequencing and cytometry by time of flight, were conducted to perform exploratory mechanistic analyses investigating immune cell dynamics and dose-dependent responses. Building on these findings, Phase Ib included two dose cohorts, each of which received three doses of MSCs administered one week apart: 1.0 × 10⁸ and 2.0 × 10⁸ cells per dose. Patients were followed up on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28 to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of multiple-dose regimens. The trials were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05227846 and NCT05984303). MSC therapy demonstrated good safety and tolerability in both Phase Ia and Phase Ib trials, with no severe adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, or serious unexpected adverse reactions observed up to Day 28. Multi-omics analyses revealed that higher MSC doses elicited stronger immunomodulatory effects, particularly by modulating monocyte subsets. In particular, myxovirus resistance 1 positive (MX1+) monocytes, a key monocyte population, exhibited dose-dependent changes and were identified as a mediator of MSC-induced immunomodulation. These effects were sustained for up to seven days post-treatment but diminished by Day 14. Preliminary clinical signals included improvements in Child–Pugh scores, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores, liver function markers, and quality-of-life metrics, particularly in the higher-dose and multiple-dose groups. This study demonstrates the safety and tolerability of MSC therapy in patients with DLC and provides the first human-based evidence on the dose‒effect relationship and optimal administration regimens. The identification of MX1+ monocytes as a critical mediator highlights the potential of MSC therapy to modulate immune dysfunction in DLC. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing MSC therapy and informing the design of future efficacy-focused clinical trials. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011936830,Tolerability
Juszczak M.; Shem K.,Treatment of obesity in spinal cord injury with tirzepatide: a case report,2025,Spinal Cord Series and Cases,10.1038/s41394-025-00699-w,"Introduction: Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) experience alterations in metabolism that result in increased central obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia placing them at elevated risk for developing cardiometabolic disease (CMD). Increased exercise and dietary modifications are the primary interventions for preventing CMD. However, people with SCI face unique challenges that prevent them from increasing their physical activity and easily modifying their nutritional intake. Tirzepatide is a medication that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be used in conjunction with lifestyle changes to treat obesity in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Case presentation: A male in his 40’s with C6 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale B SCI 15 years prior with a body mass index of 32 presented to his primary care provider for treatment of obesity. He previously worked with multiple dietitians and increased his physical activity to lose weight. Despite these interventions, he was unable to reduce his weight. He was started on tirzepatide. After 3 months of treatment, he lost 31 pounds and saw improvements in his lipid profile. The only adverse effect reported was heartburn. Discussion: The metabolic dysfunction associated with SCI and barriers to adequate exercise for weight loss place individuals with SCI at increased risk for obesity and developing CMD. Tirzepatide may be an effective adjunct therapy to lifestyle interventions to help prevent CMD in those with SCI. Further research is indicated to examine the long-term efficacy, benefits, and adverse effects that may be associated with tirzepatide. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219601681,Dyslipidemia

However, in the metabolically more susceptible Asian populations, it is not clear whether the genetic burden of glycaemic dysregulation influences early-life neurodevelopment. In a multi-ethnic Asian prospective cohort study in Singapore (Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO)), we constructed child and parental polygenic risk scores (PRS) for glycaemic dysregulation based on the largest genome-wide association studies of type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose among Asians. We found that child PRS for HOMA-IR was associated with a lower perceptual reasoning score at ~7 years (β = −0. 141, p-value = 0.024, 95% CI −0. 264 to −0. 018) and a lower WIAT-III mean score at ~9 years (β = −0.222, p-value = 0.001, 95% CI −0.357 to −0.087). This association were consistent in direction among boys and girls. These inverse associations were not influenced by parental PRS and were likely mediated via insulin resistance rather than mediators such as birth weight and childhood body mass index. Higher paternal PRS for HOMA-IR was suggestively associated with lower child perceptual reasoning at ~7 years (β = −0.172, p-value = 0.002, 95% CI −0.280 to −0.064). Replication analysis in a European cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort, showed that higher child PRS for fasting glucose was associated with lower verbal IQ score while higher maternal PRS for insulin resistance was associated with lower performance IQ score in their children at ~8.5 years. In summary, our findings suggest that higher child PRS for HOMA-IR was associated with lower cognitive scores in both Asian and European replication cohorts. Differential findings between cohorts may be attributed to genetic and environmental factors. Further investigation of the functions of the genetic structure and ancestry-specific PRS and a more comprehensive investigation of behavioural mediators may help to understand these findings better. © 2024, The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181507134,Longitudinal Study

However, the causality of these associations and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. We utilized a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal effects of blood OCN levels on AD and to assess the potential involvement of glucose and lipid metabolism. Independent instrumental variables strongly associated (P < 5E-08) with blood OCN levels were obtained from three independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the human blood proteome (N = 3301 to 35,892). Two distinct summary statistics datasets on AD from the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP, N = 63,926) and a recent study including familial-proxy AD patients (FPAD, N = 472,868) were used. Summary-level data for fasting glucose (FG), 2h-glucose post-challenge, fasting insulin, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides were incorporated to evaluate the potential role of glucose and lipid metabolism in mediating the impact of OCN on AD risk. Our findings consistently demonstrate a significantly negative correlation between genetically determined blood OCN levels and the risk of AD (IGAP: odds ratio [OR, 95%CI] = 0.83[0.72–0.96], P = 0.013; FPAD: OR = 0.81 [0.70–0.93], P = 0.002). Similar estimates with the same trend direction were obtained using other statistical approaches. Furthermore, employing multivariable MR analysis, we found that the causal relationship between OCN levels and AD was disappeared after adjustment of FG and TC (IGAP: OR = 0.97[0.80–1.17], P = 0.753; FPAD: OR = 0.98 [0.84–1.15], P = 0.831). There were no apparent instances of horizontal pleiotropy, and leave-one-out analysis showed good stability of the estimates. Our study provides evidence supporting a protective effect of blood OCN levels on AD, which is primarily mediated through regulating FG and TC levels. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying physio-pathological mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193738047,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to compare associations of a multimarker panel of biomarkers of inflammation with depressive symptoms and its symptom clusters between people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This cross-sectional study combined data from five studies including 1260 participants (n = 706 T1D, n = 454 T2D). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Serum levels of 92 biomarkers of inflammation were quantified with proximity extension assay technology. After quality control, 76 biomarkers of inflammation remained for statistical analysis. Associations between biomarkers and depressive symptom scores and clusters (cognitive-affective, somatic, anhedonia) were estimated with multivariable linear regression models. Nine biomarkers were positively associated with depressive symptoms in the total sample (CCL11/eotaxin, CCL25, CDCP1, FGF-21, IL-8, IL-10RB, IL-18, MMP-10, TNFRSF9; all p < 0.05) without interaction by diabetes type. Associations differed for eight biomarkers (pinteraction < 0.05). TNFβ was inversely associated with depressive symptoms in T1D, whereas three biomarkers (GDNF, IL-18R1, LIF-R) were positively associated with depressive symptoms in T2D. For the remaining four biomarkers (CD6, CD244, FGF-5, IFNγ) associations were not significant in either subgroup. Biomarker associations were more pronounced with somatic and anhedonia than with cognitive-affective symptoms. These results indicate that different proinflammatory pathways may contribute to depression in T1D and T2D and that there may be a symptom specificity in the link between subclinical inflammation and depression. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215354094,Anhedonia; Depression

To investigate the biological connections between the eye and brain, we integrated bulk and single-cell multiomic profiles with GWAS summary statistics for eight neuropsychiatric and five ocular diseases. Our analysis uncovered five latent factors explaining 61.7% of the genetic variance across these 13 diseases, revealing diverse correlational patterns among them. We identified 45 pleiotropic loci with 91 candidate genes that contribute to disease risk. By integrating GWAS and single-cell profiles, we implicated excitatory neurons and microglia as key contributors in the eye-brain connections. Polygenic enrichment analysis further identified 15 pleiotropic regulons in excitatory neurons and 16 in microglia that were linked to comorbid conditions. Functionally, excitatory neuron-specific regulons were involved in axon guidance and synaptic activity, while microglia-specific regulons were associated with immune response and cell activation. In sum, these findings underscore the genetic link between psychiatric disorders and ocular diseases. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217001070,Regulon

We aimed to examine the associations of biological aging with suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) and to explore possible moderators of the associations. A total of 124,529 middle and older participants from the UK Biobank were included. Phenotypic age (PhenoAge) indicating biological aging was calculated based on chronological age and nine clinical biomarkers. The residuals of PhenoAge regressed on chronological age were utilized to quantify biological aging, termed PhenoAge acceleration (PAA). Approximately one-third of baseline participants completed mental health follow-up questionnaires including suicide-related information. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to estimate the associations. 2718 (2.2%) SA and 5207 (4.4%) SI cases were documented. Compared with participants in the lowest quartile of PAA, those in the highest quartile had a 21.8% [odds ratio (OR) = 1.218; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.087–1.198) and 12.5% (OR = 1.125, 95% CI: 1.035–1.224) higher odds of SA and SI, respectively. Biologically older participants (PAA > 0) were more likely to report SA (OR = 1.104, 95% CI: 1.018–1.198) and SI (OR = 1.064, 95% CI: 1.003–1.129). Gender, age, socioeconomic status (SES), physical activity, and somatic and psychiatric disorders could modify the associations (P for interaction <0.05). Our findings indicated that PAA-measured aging might be positively associated with SA/SI. Interventions aimed at slowing aging might contribute to suicide prevention, especially among males, young adults, low SES, the physically inactive, and vulnerable populations. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008710477,Depression; Quartile

It is postulated that the nanotopography of the TNTs provide cells with a biomimetic environment, allowing HGFs to form more focal adhesion (FA) attachment sites at the tubule edges. Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on MEDLINE, DOSS, EMBASE and Google Scholar from January 2012 to January 2022. The identified studies were screened based on titles and abstracts for inclusion criteria. The relevant studies underwent data extraction. The risk of bias was assessed through the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) tool. Results: This systematic review included four studies evaluating cell proliferation, protein expression, gene expression and cell morphology of HGFs evocative of stronger and mature soft tissue attachment. A significant increase in the cell proliferation at TNTs compared to cp-Ti, at day 7 for three studies and at day 14, for one study was evident. In addition, a significant increase in the type 1 collagen protein expression at TNTs compared to cp-Ti, at day 6 for one study and day 7 for two studies. Enhanced cellular extensions from HGFs attached onto TNTs, compared to cp-Ti was observed in all four studies. All the primary effects evaluated suggest the formation of better interlaced fibers giving a stronger adhesion than the parallel ones which is the most relevant outcome of this research. Conclusion: HGFs showed enhanced contact guidance onto TNTs but a true biological attachment was not confirmed. This review involved invitro studies which lack methodological rigor to compare among studies, lack information and have small sample sizes limiting effectiveness of parametric tests. The results may be unpredictable when translated to in-vivo studies mainly affected by confounding factors. Further research is needed to determine the precise mechanism of mechanical attachment between the soft tissue and the transmucosal surfaces. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008458856,Nanotopography; Titanium Dioxide

We postulated that metabolically active tumors may compete with the brain for glucose uptake and evaluated glucose uptake in the brain and liver in patients with multiple myeloma in various states of response and relapse. The ratio of brain to liver glucose activity (B2LR) mirrors disease activity in myeloma, predicts the presence of extramedullary disease and is also predictive of a short response to chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy.

However, appropriate intensities of conditioning regimens are still unclear, especially for middle-aged patients. To compare outcomes after RIC and MAC regimens, we analyzed AML patients aged 16 years or older in the Japanese registry database, who underwent single cord unit CBT between 2010-2019. Median ages of the RIC group (n = 1353) and the MAC group (n = 2101) were 59 and 51 years (P < 0.001), respectively. 5-year overall survival (OS) after MAC was superior to that of RIC (38.3% vs 27.7%, P < 0.001) with lower incidence of relapse (33.9% vs 37.4%, P = 0.029) and better neutrophil engraftment (84.7% vs 75.9%, P < 0.001). Detailed subgroup analysis revealed that age at transplantation is the most important factor affecting 5-year OS in RIC and MAC. This analysis identified a threshold of 55 years, beyond which the superiority of MAC disappeared, irrespective of other factors such as disease status or performance status. In conclusion, RIC may be preferable for patients aged 56 or older in CBT for AML due to higher potential toxicities. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217168173,Cord blood; Cumulative incidence

Recent preclinical data indicate that acute GVHD causes a loss of intestinal neuroendocrine L-cells leading to reduced levels of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). GLP-2 substitution improved GVHD severity and increased Paneth cells and intestinal stem cells in mice. This motivated us to treat patients with refractory intestinal aGHVD using the GLP-2-analogon teduglutide. In this retrospective multicenter survey, 17 patients received teduglutide as salvage-therapy for SR-intestinal aGVHD. The best response (CR or PR) at any time point during and after treatment was 64.7% (11/17) including 41.2% (7/17) CR and 23.5% (4/17) PR. At a median follow-up of 28 weeks after teduglutide 10/17 patients are alive. Most patients experienced an increase of the albumin serum level within 2 months after the first teduglutide dose, including patients who clinically did not respond to teduglutide treatment.

The precise nature of these regulatory factors and their roles at bridging the bone, bone marrow adipose tissue, extramedullary body fat and whole-body energy homeostasis are being explored. In this study, we report that KIAA1199, a secreted factor produced from bone and bone marrow, previously described as an inhibitor of bone formation, also plays a role at promoting adipogenesis. KIAA1199-deficient mice exhibit reduced bone marrow adipose tissue, subcutaneous and visceral fat tissue mass, blood cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and glycerol, as well as improved insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, liver and fat. Moreover, these mice are protected from the detrimental effects of high-fat diet feeding, with decreased obesity, lower blood glucose and glucose tolerance, as well as decreased adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. In human studies, plasma levels of KIAA1199 or its expression levels in adipose tissue are positively correlated with insulin resistance and blood levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, glycerol, fasting glucose and HOMA-IR. Mechanistically, KIAA1199 mediates its effects on adipogenesis through modulating osteopontin-integrin and AKT / ERK signaling.

There are few large-scale studies that estimate irAE prevalence. This paper presents a systematic review that reports the prevalence of irAE by cancer type and ICI. Methods: A systematic review was undertaken in MEDLINE OVID, EMBASE and Web of Science databases from 2017–2021. A total of 293 studies were identified for analysis and, of these, event rate was calculated for 272 studies, which involved 58,291 patients with irAE among 305,879 total patients on ICI. Event rate was calculated by irAE and ICI type. Results: Mean event rate for general irAE occurrence across any grade was 40.0% (37.3–42.7%) and high grade was 19.7% (15.8–23.7%). Mean event rates for six specific types of irAE are reported. Mean event rate for ICI monotherapy was 30.5% (28.1–32.9%), 45.7% (29.6–61.7%) for ICI combination therapy, and 30.0% (25.3–34.6%) for both ICI monotherapy and combination therapy. Conclusion: This systematic review characterises irAE prevalence across current research that examines irAE risk factors across cancers and ICI. The findings confirms that irAE occurrence is very common in the real-world setting, both high grade and irAE across any grade. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208125878,Immune checkpoint

Methods: Using linked data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and national cancer registry we compared blood test use and abnormal results from the 24-months pre-diagnosis in 10,575 cancer patients (any site), and 52,875 matched-controls aged ≥30 presenting, with abdominal pain or bloating to primary care. Results: Cancer patients had two-fold increased odds of having a blood test (odds ratio(OR):1.51–2.29) and 2-3-fold increased odds of having an abnormal blood test result (OR:2.42–3.30) in the year pre-diagnosis compared to controls. Raised inflammatory markers were the most common abnormality (74–79% of tested cases). Rates of blood test use and abnormal results progressively increased from 7 months pre-diagnosis in cancer patients, with relatively small corresponding increases in symptomatic controls. In cancer patients, the largest increases from baseline were raised platelets in males with abdominal pain (increased 33-fold), raised white blood cell count in males with abdominal bloating (increased 37-fold) and low albumin in females with either symptom (increased 22–41 fold). Conclusions: Common blood test abnormalities are early signals of cancer in some individuals with non-specific abdominal symptoms and could support expedited cancer diagnosis.

Notably, MASLD prevalence is lower in premenopausal women than in men, suggesting a potential protective role of estrogens in mitigating disease onset and progression. In this study, we utilized preclinical in vitro models—immortalized cell lines and hepatocyte-like cells derived from human embryonic stem cells—exposed to clinically relevant steatotic-inducing agents. These exposures led to lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and mitochondrial dysfunction, along with decreased expression of markers associated with hepatocyte functionality and differentiation. Estrogen treatment in steatotic-induced liver cells resulted in reduced ROS levels and LD content while preserving mitochondrial integrity, mediated by the upregulation of mitochondrial thioredoxin 2 (TRX2), an antioxidant system regulated by the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, disruption of TRX2, either pharmacologically using auranofin or through genetic interference, was sufficient to counteract the protective effects of estrogens, highlighting a potential mechanism through which estrogens may prevent or slow MASLD progression. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731665,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In this investigation, we evaluated the hypothesis that hyperglycemic conditions augment the pro-inflammatory immune response in the kidney by promoting podocyte-specific expression of the stress response protein regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1). In support of the hypothesis, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes increased REDD1 protein abundance in the kidney concomitant with renal immune cell infiltration. In diabetic mice, administration of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin was followed by reductions in blood glucose concentration, renal REDD1 protein abundance, and immune cell infiltration. In contrast with diabetic REDD1+/+ mice, diabetic REDD1−/− mice did not exhibit albuminuria, increased pro-inflammatory factors, or renal macrophage infiltration. In cultured human podocytes, exposure to hyperglycemic conditions promoted REDD1-dependent activation of NF-κB signaling. REDD1 deletion in podocytes attenuated both the increase in chemokine expression and macrophage chemotaxis under hyperglycemic conditions. Notably, podocyte-specific REDD1 deletion prevented the pro-inflammatory immune cell infiltration in the kidneys of diabetic mice. Furthermore, exposure of podocytes to hyperglycemic conditions promoted REDD1-dependent pyroptotic cell death, evidenced by an NLRP3-mediated increase in caspase-1 activity and LDH release. REDD1 expression in podocytes was also required for an increase in pyroptosis markers in the glomeruli of diabetic mice. The data support that podocyte-specific REDD1 is necessary for chronic NF-κB activation in the context of diabetes and raises the prospect that therapies targeting podocyte-specific REDD1 may be helpful in DN. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218107972,Pyroptosis

There are conflicting reports on whether inhibition of eIF2α dephosphorylation by PP1 holoenzyme with the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15 A is the mechanism of action of Sephin1. In the present study, we found that Sephin1 significantly suppressed renal tubular cell death in an animal model of ER stress administered with tunicamycin. CHOP, which plays a central role in the ER stress-induced cell death pathway, requires nuclear translocation to act as a transcription factor to increase the expression of cell death-related genes. Sephin1 markedly suppressed this nuclear translocation of CHOP. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the cell death suppressive effect of Sephin1, we used human renal tubular epithelial cells under ER stress with tunicamycin. Sephin1 reduced intracellular CHOP levels by promoting CHOP phosphorylation at Ser30, which led to protein degradation in UPS. Phosphorylated CHOP is generated by Thr172-phosphorylated activated AMPK, and Sephin1 increased phosphorylated AMPK. Phosphorylated AMPK is inactivated by PP2A through dephosphorylation of its Thr172, and Sephin1 inhibits the formation of the PP2A holoenzyme with the PP2A subunit B isoform delta. These results indicate that inhibition of PP2A holoenzyme formation is the molecular target of Sephin1 in this experimental system. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219120362,Dephosphorylation; Tunicamycin

The neutrophil-associated inflammatory microenvironment contributes to the activation of tumor cells. In this study, we report a role of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) promote tumor progression of LUAD by crosstalk between neutrophils and tumor cells. Mechanistically, in co-culture with tumor cells, downregulation of TPM2 on tumor cells increases neutrophil elastase (ELANE) levels in neutrophils regulated by p38/ MAPK signaling activation, and ELANE promotes tumor cell progression through the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, downregulation of TPM2 activates ELANE of neutrophils to facilitate ERK1/2 activation, thus enhancing IL1β and IL8 secretion for chemoattraction of more neutrophils to tumor microenvironment. The new studies identify an accomplice role for the interaction between TPM2 and ELANE in promoting LUAD progression and provide potential strategies in the prevention and/or treatment of LUAD and other cancers. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002975445,Crosstalk; Interleukin 8; Neutrophil elastase; Tumor progression

Unfortunately, current clinical treatment options offer limited efficacy, highlighting the necessity for uncovering novel therapeutic strategies. Here, monotherapy and combination library screening were employed, and identified that the efficacy of obatoclax, a pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitor, was improved significantly when combined with ER-stress inducers, including tunicamycin. Combinatorial knockdown of anti-apoptotic proteins confirmed that the loss of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL synergistically enhanced apoptosis under ER stress conditions. Although ER stress inducers triggered the stress response in GBM cells, obatoclax co-treatment enhanced this response by upregulating ATF-4 and CHOP, which promoted apoptosis along with increased caspase 3/7 activity and cleavage of PARP. ATF-4 knockdown significantly decreased the apoptosis induced by obatoclax and tunicamycin co-treatment and reduced the expression of CHOP and BIM. Under ER stress responses, GBM cells exerted an autophagy response to recover from the stress condition; however, obatoclax co-treatment disrupted the autophagy responses, particularly by disrupting autophagic cargo degradation. Our findings suggest that targeting Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, coupled with ER-stress induction, could be a promising strategy for the treatment of GBM, highlighting the potential for combination therapies involving pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitors to overcome current limitations in the treatment of GBM. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011372911,Integrated stress response; Tunicamycin

However, developing hydrogel nanofiber-based nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) with tailored drug release profiles to synergistically promote angiogenesis and axonal regeneration remains a significant challenge. In this study, novel polydopamine (PDA)-modified gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel nanofibers are developed as an efficient drug delivery platform for sustained release of Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein-2 (SFRP2). This platform aims to promote neurite outgrowth, facilitate nerve function recovery, and enhance angiogenesis through Wnt signaling pathways. Results indicate that PDA coating significantly improves the hydrophilicity and mechanical properties of GelMA hydrogel nanofibers, which were fabricated using a combination of electrospinning and photo-crosslinking technology. This modification enables SFRP2 loading for sustained release through π-π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding. In vitro experiments demonstrate that SFRP2-loaded hydrogel nanofibers effectively enhance the adhesion, proliferation, viability, and migration of Mouse Schwann Cells (MSCs), while also promoting tube formation and ameliorating the inflammatory microenvironment of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, the SFRP2-loaded hydrogel nanofibers are confirmed to exert their functions for angiogenesis and peripheral nerve regeneration via the calcium-dependent calcineurin/NFATc3 signaling pathway. Finally, the hydrogel nanofiber-based NGCs are applied in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury, and results demonstrate that the SFRP2 ~ PDA@GelMA conduit significantly enhances angiogenesis, promotes peripheral nerve repair, and facilitates target muscle restoration and functional recovery, thus presents a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with peripheral nerve injuries. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009980307,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Moreover, we devised a cost-effective synthetic route for its production. In this study, we demonstrate that the blue benzoquinone exhibits antibacterial activity against additional pathogens, including the priority pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii. Notably, the compound effectively killed clinical strains of A. baumannii resistant to multiple antibiotics, including carbapenem and colistin. Furthermore, A. baumannii did not develop resistance to the benzoquinone even after multiple growth cycles under sub-inhibitory concentrations, unlike the tested antibiotics.

Method: Objective nutritional screening tools including geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, were evaluated in patients with GC at our institution. Malnutrition was diagnosed according to the GLIM criteria. The diagnostic value of GNRI, PNI, and COUNT scores in identifying GLIM-defined malnutrition was assessed by conducting Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. The Kappa coefficient (k) was used to assess agreement between three objective nutritional screening tools and GLIM criteria. Results: A total of 316 patients were enrolled in this study, and malnutrition was diagnosed in 151 (47.8%) patients based on the GLIM criteria. The GNRI demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.805, 95% CI: 0.758–0.852) for detecting GLIM-defined malnutrition, while the PNI and COUNT score showed poor diagnostic accuracy with AUCs of 0.699 (95% CI: 0.641–0.757) and 0.665 (95% CI: 0.605–0.725) respectively. Among these objective nutritional screening tools, the GNRI-based malnutrition risk assessment demonstrated the highest specificity (80.0%), accuracy (72.8%), PPV (74.8%), NPV (71.4%), and consistency (k = 0.452) with GLIM-defined malnutrition. Conclusions: Compared to PNI and COUNT scores, GNRI demonstrated superior performance as an objective nutritional screening tool for identifying GLIM-defined malnutrition in GC patients. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205223146,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, the optimal caloric intake target during the acute phase of AE remains unclear. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the impact of caloric intake on short-term clinical outcomes in AE patients, specifically focusing on the improvement in Clinical Assessment Scale for Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE) scores, to provide recommendations for nutritional support during the acute phase. Methods: A retrospective study analyzed clinical data from 128 adult AE patients requiring nutritional support, admitted to West China Hospital, Sichuan University, from January 2020 to January 2024. Patients were categorized into low-calorie intake (below 70% of requirements), standard-calorie intake (70–100% of requirements), and high-calorie intake (above 100% of requirements) groups. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to quantify the associations. Results: Higher caloric intake was significantly associated with improved CASE scores (β = 8.58, SE = 3.75, 95% CI = 1.14 to 16.03, p = 0.02). Low caloric intake negatively impacted the improvement of CASE scores (p = 0.049), particularly in seizures and speech problems. The low-calorie intake group had significantly longer hospital stays and nutrition therapy durations (45.79 ± 30.98 days, p < 0.01; 40.39 ± 31.92 days, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Adequate caloric intake has a significant positive impact on the short-term clinical outcomes of AE patients, suggesting that meeting or exceeding caloric requirements may promote neurological recovery in AE patients. Future prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and further optimize nutritional support strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208259894,Caloric theory

In this study, we evaluate the effect of individually tailored dietary counseling on frailty status among home care clients with PEM or its risk aged 75 or older with a follow-up of six months. Methods: This intervention study is part of the non-randomized population-based Nutrition, Oral Health and Medication (NutOrMed) study in Finland. The frailty was assessed using the abbreviated Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (aCGA) and included 15 questions from three different domains: cognitive status (MMSE), functional status (ADL, IADL) and depression (GDS-15). The study population consisted of persons with PEM or its risk (intervention group n = 90, control group n = 55). PEM or its risk was defined by MNA score <24 and/or plasma albumin <35 g/l. Registered nutritionist gave individually tailored nutritional counseling for participants at the baseline and nutritional treatment included conventional food items. Results: The mean age was 83.9 in the intervention and 84.3 in the control group. At the baseline frailty prevalence was 74.4% (n = 67) and after six-month 61.1% (n = 55) in the intervention group and, respectively 74.5% (n = 41) and 80.0% (n = 44) in the control group. The intervention decreased significantly (p < 0.001) the prevalence of frailty in the intervention group, while it increased in the control group. Conclusions: Individually tailored nutritional counseling reduces the prevalence of frailty among vulnerable home care clients with PEM or its risk. In the nutritional treatment of frailty, adequate intake of protein and energy should be a cornerstone of treatment. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210022211,Depression

We aimed to explore the associations between myosteatosis, as assessed by computed tomography (CT), with demographic parameters, body composition metrics, muscle strength, metabolic parameters and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Subjects/Methods: We enrolled 216 patients (age 60.3 ± 10.6 years, 63% men) with CKD stages 3–5. Abdominal CT scans at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) were used to assess body composition. Abdominal obesity was determined by abdominal adipose tissue (AT), sarcopenia by low skeletal muscle area (SMA) and low handgrip strength. Myosteatosis was evaluated by two parameters using CT scans at L3: mean muscle attenuation and percentage of intermuscular adipose tissue (%IMAT) within SMA. We evaluated the correlation between parameters of myosteatosis with demographic, clinical and metabolic variables. To determine independent predictors of myosteatosis, a multiple linear regression model was fitted. Mortality risk was evaluated with Cox-regression analysis. Results: Both parameters of myosteatosis were independently associated with age, metabolic syndrome, abdominal AT and SMA in the multiple linear regression analysis (adjusted R2 for multiple linear regression: muscle attenuation model 0.535, P < 0.001; %IMAT model 0.462, P < 0.001). Moreover, higher %IMAT and lower attenuation were associated with a higher mortality risk.

We aimed at investigating to which extent women with GDM adhered to dietary recommendations and to which extent an impact was observed on the glycaemic control compared to women without GDM. Subjects/methods: Women with overweight/obesity (n = 349) were recruited in early pregnancy. GDM was diagnosed with a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test in mid-or-early pregnancy (median 25.9 and 14.7 gestational weeks). Dietary assessments included an index of dietary quality (good ≥ 10 and poor < 10/15 scores) and 3-day food-diaries with nutrient intake calculated and dietary patterns identified. Glucose and insulin concentrations were analysed from blood samples collected in late pregnancy (after GDM diagnosis). Results: Women with GDM (n = 98) followed more often a healthier dietary pattern (62.2%) than women without GDM (49.0%, p < 0.05), but no difference in good dietary quality was seen (53% vs. 59.8%, p = 0.071). While the majority of women with GDM adhered to some recommendations, 51% to carbohydrate, 54.1% to total fat and 69.4% to sucrose, only 16.3% adhered to the protein and 4.1% to the fibre intake recommendations. Women with GDM had lower adherence to protein, total fat and fibre recommendations but higher adherence to that of sucrose than women without GDM (p < 0.05). A good dietary quality was associated with lower insulin and HOMA2-IR values (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Adherence to dietary recommendations, particularly fibre and protein intake, is unsatisfactory in women with GDM. Overall dietary quality is related to better control of glucose metabolism proposing a target for dietary counselling. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000291556,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: Patients aged 30–80 years from the Guangzhou Diabetic Eye Study were categorized into non-HTN, stage 1-HTN, and stage 2-HTN groups based on BP criteria. Macular and parapapillary CT were measured using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Mixed linear regression models analysed CT decline rates over a median 2.1-year follow-up, adjusting for confounders. Results: 803 diabetes patients were included. Both stage 1-HTN and stage 2-HTN groups showed significantly thinner macular and parapapillary CT compared to non-HTN (all P < 0.05). Stage 2-HTN correlated with reduced macular CT thinning (coef = −11.29 μm/year; 95% CI, −22.36 to −0.22; P = 0.046) after adjustment, but not in the parapapillary area (coef = −4.07 μm/year; 95% CI, −12.89 to 4.74; P = 0.365). Subgroup analyses indicated faster macular CT decline in stage 2-HTN among those <65 years old (coef = −20.31 μm/year; 95% CI, −35.67 to −4.95; P = 0.10), males (coef = −14.1 μm/year; 95% CI, −32.54 to −4.33; P = 0.004), BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (coef = −10.24 μm/year; 95% CI, −26.86 to −6.38; P = 0.007), HbA1c > 6.5% (coef = −8.91 μm/year; 95% CI, −13.49 to −4.68; P = 0.001), and diabetes duration <10 years (coef = −12.78 μm/year; 95% CI, −27.48 to −1.91; P = 0.008). Conclusion: Stage 2-HTN is associated with accelerated macular CT loss in diabetic patients, suggesting macular CT measurements could potentially serve as early indicators of systemic hypertension.

It is also critical for type 1 diabetes (T1D) autoimmunity, which has a peak incidence between 1 and 2 years of age. Here, we investigated age-related longitudinal gene expression changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children aged 3 months to 3 years who had an increased genetic risk for T1D, aiming to delineate gene expression trajectories and identify patterns potentially linked to the development of islet autoimmunity. We found 2 432 genes (12.5% of analyzed genes) to exhibit significant temporal dynamics in the first 3 years of life. These genes were grouped into six major clusters each demonstrating distinct expression trajectories of consistent increase or decrease with age, as well as U-shaped, and inverted U-shaped age-related patterns. Notably, genes in clusters with U-shaped expression trajectories, which mirrored the incidence of islet autoantibodies, were enriched for T1D susceptibility genes, particularly within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region. This study underscores the dynamic nature of gene expression in early childhood and its potential connection to T1D risk. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000475955,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

After propensity score matching, the long and acute COVID cohorts included 2839 men with an average age of 54.5±16.7 and 55.1±17.1 years respectively (p = 0.21). Men with long COVID were more likely to develop ED or be prescribed PDE5i (3.63%) when compared to men with only acute COVID infections (2.61%) [RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.04, 1.87]. There was no statistically significant risk of developing ED or being prescribed PDE5i for individuals who received vasopressors [RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.77,1.10] or were hospitalized [RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.82,1.06]. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194848283,2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Coronavirus

NAFLD is recognized as a disease with systemic involvement. Erectile dysfunction is a prevalent condition among men. The study examined the relationship between NAFLD, assessed via U.S. Fatty Liver Index (USFLI), and erectile dysfunction. The study used cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2001 and 2004 to examine the health of those over 20 years of age, collecting details on their erectile dysfunction, USFLI, and several other essential variables. A USFLI score equal to or exceeding 30 was chosen to diagnose NAFLD, while a USFLI score below 10 was utilized to exclude the presence of fatty liver. There were 3763 participants, with 29.1% (1095/3763) who experienced erectile dysfunction. After accounting for all potential covariates, USFLI was positively associated with erectile dysfunction (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02 ~ 1.03; P < 0.001). Compared with individuals with Q1 (USFLI < 10), the adjusted odds ratio values for USFLI and erectile dysfunction in Q2 (10 ≤ USFLI < 30) and Q3 (USFLI ≥ 30, NAFLD) were 1.84 (95% CI: 1.46 ~ 2.32, p < 0.001) and 2.18 (95% CI: 1.66 ~ 2.87, p < 0.001), respectively. The association USFLI and erectile dysfunction exhibited an L-shaped curve (nonlinear, P = 0.014). The odds ratio value of developing erectile dysfunction was 1.03 (95% CI: 1.021 ~ 1.04, P < 0.001) in participants with USFLI < 50.18. This study identified a positive correlation between USFLI and erectile dysfunction within the adult American population. Our findings imply that NAFLD might constitute an independent risk factor for erectile dysfunction. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193918930,Cross-sectional study

To address this issue, we identify and modulate red fluorescent protein-like fluorophores to bind Squash, a highly folded fluorogenic RNA. One of these fluorophores, DFQL-1T, exhibits photostable NIR fluorescence when bound to Squash, enabling RNA visualization in living mammalian cells and mice. With Squash:DFQL-1T complexes, we generate RNA-based sensors for detecting non-coding RNAs and small molecule targets in living mammalian cells and in mice.

Yet, their potential as drug targets for brain disorders remains underexplored. The fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14)/voltage-gated Na+ channel 1.6 (Nav1.6) complex regulates excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a central hub of reward circuitry that controls motivated behaviors. Here, we identified compound 1028 (IUPAC: ethyl 3-(2-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-1H-indol-1-yl)acetamido)benzoate), a brain-permeable small molecule that targets FGF14R117, a critical residue located within a druggable pocket at the FGF14/Nav1.6 PPI interface. We found that 1028 modulates FGF14/Nav1.6 complex assembly and depolarizes the voltage-dependence of Nav1.6 channel inactivation with nanomolar potency by modulating the intramolecular interaction between the III-IV linker and C-terminal domain of the Nav1.6 channel. Consistent with the compound’s effects on Nav1.6 channel inactivation, 1028 enhances MSN excitability ex vivo and accumbal neuron firing rate in vivo in murine models. Systemic administration of 1028 maintains behavioral motivation preferentially during motivationally deficient conditions in murine models. These behavioral effects were abrogated by in vivo gene silencing of Fgf14 in the NAc and were accompanied by a selective reduction in accumbal dopamine levels during reward consumption in murine models. These findings underscore the potential to selectively regulate complex behaviors associated with neuropsychiatric disorders through targeting of PPIs in neurons. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213993873,Medium spiny neuron; NAV1

By analyzing the lactylomes and proteomes of mouse myocardium during ischemia-reperfusion injury using mass spectrometry, we show that both Serpina3k protein expression and its lactylation at lysine 351 are increased upon reperfusion. Both Serpina3k and its human homolog, SERPINA3, are abundantly expressed in cardiac fibroblasts, but not in cardiomyocytes. Biochemically, lactylation of Serpina3k enhances protein stability. Using Serpina3k knockout mice and mice overexpressing its lactylation-deficient mutant, we find that Serpina3k protects from cardiac injury in a lysine 351 lactylation-dependent manner. Mechanistically, ischemia-reperfusion-stimulated fibroblasts secrete Serpina3k/SERPINA3, and protect cardiomyocytes from reperfusion-induced apoptosis in a paracrine fashion, partially through the activation of cardioprotective reperfusion injury salvage kinase and survivor activating factor enhancement pathways. Our results demonstrate the pivotal role of protein lactylation in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, which may hold therapeutic value. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217273055,Myocardial Reperfusion Injury

However, the therapeutic efficacy is suboptimal without achieving a complete tumor regression, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we discover a subpopulation of cancer cells with upregulated CD133 and programmed death-ligand 1 in mouse melanoma, resistant to the phagocytosis by the transferred macrophages. Compared to the CD133-PD-L1- cancer cells, the CD133+PD-L1+ cancer cells express higher transforming growth factor-β signaling molecules to foster a resistant tumor niche, that restricts the trafficking of the transferred macrophages by stiffened extracellular matrix, and inhibits their cell-killing capability by immunosuppressive factors. The CD133+PD-L1+ cancer cells exhibit tumorigenic potential. The CD133+PD-L1+ cells are further identified in the clinically metastatic melanoma. Hyperthermia reverses the resistance of CD133+PD-L1+ cancer cells through upregulating the ‘eat me’ signal calreticulin, significantly improving the efficacy of adoptive macrophage therapy.

Following Plasmodium acquisition by Anopheles gambiae, mosquito gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (mosGILT) plays a critical role in its subsequent sporogony in the mosquito. A critical location for this development is the midgut, a tissue we show expresses mosGILT. Using membrane-feeding and murine infection models, we demonstrate that antibodies against mosGILT reduce the number of P. falciparum and P. berghei oocysts in the midgut and the infection prevalence of both species in the mosquito. mosGILT antibodies act in the mosquito midgut, specifically impacting the Plasmodium oocyst stage. Targeting mosGILT can therefore interfere with the Plasmodium life cycle in the mosquito and potentially serve as a transmission-blocking vaccine. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215356222,Anopheles gambiae; Plasmodium (life cycle)

However, the specific consequences of each histone PTM remain largely unclear, primarily due to the lack of methods for selectively and rapidly introducing a desired histone PTM in living cells without genetic engineering. Here, we report the development of a cell-permeable histone acetylation catalyst, BAHA-LANA-PEG-CPP44, which selectively enters leukemia cells, binds to chromatin, and acetylates H2BK120 of endogenous histones in a short reaction time. Time-course analyses of this in-cell catalytic reaction revealed that H2BK120 acetylation attenuates the chromatin binding of negative elongation factor E (NELFE), an onco-transcription factor. This H2BK120 acetylation-mediated removal of NELFE from chromatin reshapes transcription, slows leukemia cell viability, and reduces their tumorigenic potential in mice. Therefore, this histone acetylation catalyst provides a unique tool for elucidating the time-resolved consequences of histone PTMs and may offer a modality for cancer chemotherapy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217001671,Epigenome; Transcription

The interaction between NP surfaces and plasma-resident biomolecules results in the formation of a biomolecular corona, which varies patient-to-patient and as a function of disease state. This study investigates how the progression of acute systemic inflammatory disease influences NP corona compositions and the corresponding effects on innate immune cell interactions, phenotypes, and cytokine responses. NP coronas alter cell associations in a disease-dependent manner, induce differential co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecule expression, and influence cytokine release. Integrated multi-omics analysis of proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and cytokine datasets highlight a set of differentially enriched TLR4 ligands that correlate with dynamic NP corona-mediated immune activation. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout studies validate that NP coronas mediate this response through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling. Our findings illuminate the personalized nature of corona formation under a dynamic inflammatory condition and its impact on NP-mediated immune activation profiles and inflammation, suggesting that disease progression-related alterations in plasma composition can manifest in the corona to cause unintended toxicity and altered therapeutic efficacy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216608290,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

It remains elusive how macrophages detach these surface-bound particles during phagocytosis. We show that, rather than binding directly to these particles, macrophages form unique β2 integrin-mediated adhesion structures at the cell-substrate interfaces, specifically encircling the surface-bound particles. These circular adhesion structures that we named phagocytic adhesion rings (PARs) serve as strongholds to support local ring-shaped actin structures constricting into the particle-substrate cleavages, thereby pinching off the particles from the substrate. During this process, integrins in PARs sustain tensions due to the reaction force of actin polymerization against the particles. Such tensions are critical for phagocytic efficiency of surface-bound particles. PARs were formed in all tested macrophages (mouse, human and fish) and micron-sized particles (microbeads and E. coli), demonstrating their conserved role in the phagocytosis. This study reveals a mechanism of PAR-mediated phagocytosis, specialized for the detachment and internalization of surface-bound particles. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216999525,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We also observe an age-related decrease in hepatic glutathione (GSH) activity through noninvasive photoacoustic imaging. Using these probes, we perform longitudinal studies in aged mice treated with ATN-224, a Cu chelator, and demonstrate that this treatment improves Cu homeostasis and preserves ALDH1A1 activity.

Historically, vacuole-like ultrastructures in epididymal epithelial cells were observed via transmission electron microscopy but were undefined. Here, we utilize volume electron microscopy (vEM) to generate 3D reconstructions of epididymal epithelial cells and identify these vacuoles as intercellular organelle reservoirs (IORs) in the lateral intercellular space (LIS), which contains protein aggregates, autophagosomes, lysosome-related organelles and mitochondrial residues. Immunolabelling of organelle markers such as P62, LC3, LAMP1 and TOMM20 confirm these findings. The IOR size or number varies across four epididymal regions and decreases with age. Rab27a mutant mice exhibit reduced IORs in the caput epididymis and a subfertility phenotype, suggesting the involvement of Rab27a in the formation of IORs. Furthermore, we observe the presence of IORs between intestinal epithelial cells besides epididymis. Amino acid transporters at IOR edges suggest dynamic protein recycling.

IHBD formation is closely linked to developmental specification of biliary epithelial cells (BECs) starting as early as E13.5, but mechanisms regulating differential IHBD morphology remain poorly understood. Here, we show that duct and ductule development has distinct genetic requirements, with Sox9 required to form the developmental precursors to peripheral ductules in adult livers. By optimizing large-volume IHBD imaging, we find that IHBDs emerge as a homogeneous webbed structure by E15.5 and undergo morphological maturation through 2 weeks of age. Developmental knockout of Sox9 leads to decreased postnatal branching morphogenesis, resulting in adult IHBDs with normal ducts but significantly fewer ductules. In the absence of Sox9, BECs fail to mature and exhibit elevated TGF-β signaling and Activin A. Exogenous Activin A is sufficient to induce developmental gene expression and morphological defects in wild-type BEC organoids, while early postnatal inhibition of Activin A in vivo rescues IHBD morphogenesis in the absence of Sox9. Our data demonstrate that proper IHBD architecture relies on inhibition of Activin A by Sox9 to promote ductule morphogenesis, defining regulatory mechanisms underlying morphological heterogeneity. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218456575,SOX9

In this study, we demonstrate that the ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6) is primarily localized in podocytes of the glomeruli and is upregulated in two different models of diabetic mice. Podocyte-specific CerS6 knockout ameliorates glomerular injury and inflammatory responses in male diabetic mice and in male mice with adriamycin-induced nephropathy. In contrast, podocyte-specific overexpression of CerS6 sufficiently induces proteinuria. Mechanistically, CerS6-derived ceramide (d18:1/16:0) can bind to the mitochondrial channel protein VDAC1 at Glu59 residue, initiating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage, activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, and ultimately promoting an immune-inflammatory response in the kidney. Importantly, CERS6 expression is increased in podocytes from kidney biopsies of patients with DKD and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and the expression level of CERS6 is correlated negatively with glomerular filtration rate and positively with proteinuria. Thus, our findings suggest that targeting CerS6 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for proteinuric kidney diseases. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218472188,Sphingolipid

Unilateral hippocampal stroke resulted in atypical wandering behavior coincident with ipsilesional terminal spreading depolarization (sustained increase in GCaMP6f fluorescence). Ischemia induced seizures that propagated to the contralesional hippocampus triggering a transient spreading depolarization, predominantly in females.

Here we show that extracellular vesicles engineered to express Signal Regulatory Protein Alpha (SIRP-EVs), produced via a scalable 3D bioreactor process with high yield and purity, exhibit significant therapeutic potential by targeting damaged cells and promoting tissue repair. SIRP-EVs block CD47, a crucial inhibitory signal on necroptotic cells, to enhance macrophage-mediated clearance of dying hepatocytes. They also deliver regenerative cargo from mesenchymal stem cells, reprogramming macrophages to support liver regeneration. In male animal models, SIRP-EVs significantly reduce liver injury markers and improve survival, demonstrating their dual-function therapeutic efficacy. By integrating the resolution of necroptosis with regenerative macrophage reprogramming, SIRP-EVs represent a promising platform for restoring liver function.

Previous unbiased proteomic studies indicate a potential association between cardiac diseases and the progesterone receptor membrane-bound component-2 (PGRMC2); however, the role of PGRMC2 in the heart remains unknown. In this study, we use a heart-specific knockout (KO) mouse model (MyH6•Pgrmc2flox/flox) in which the Pgrmc2 gene was selectively deleted in cardiomyocytes. Here we show that PGRMC2 serves as a mediator of steroid hormones for rapid calcium signaling in cardiomyocytes to maintain cardiac contraction, sufficient stroke volume, and adequate cardiac output by regulating the cardiac pressure-volume relationship. The KO hearts from male and female mice exhibit an impairment in pressure-volume relationship. Under hypoxic conditions, this pressure-volume dysregulation progresses to congestive left and right ventricular failure in the KO hearts.

Using a safe, placenta-permeable inducer, this system facilitates specific, rapid, and efficient cell ablation. The system’s temporal control allows precise adjustment of disease severity, generating reproducible models ranging from congenital kidney deficiency to severe chronic kidney disease. Cells with low expression levels of inducible caspase 9 and those in solid organs are less susceptible to apoptosis. However, this limitation can be overcome by inhibiting the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, thereby expanding the system’s applicability.

While IL-1 is important to combat C. albicans infections, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using global and conditional Il1r1 knockouts in mice, here we show that IL-1R signaling in non-hematopoietic cells in the kidney and brain is crucial for a protective response. In the kidney, endothelial IL-1R contributes to fungal clearance independent of neutrophil recruitment, while IL-1R in hematopoietic cells is dispensable. IL-1R signaling indirectly recruits neutrophils and monocytes in the brain by regulating chemokines and adhesion molecules. Single-nucleus-RNA-sequencing data implicates excessive metabolic activity and oxidative phosphorylation across all cell types in the kidney of Il1r1-deficient mice within a few hours upon infection, with associated, localized hypoxia at infection foci.

Here, we report a covalently reactive hemostat based on blood-imbibing and -crosslinking microparticles. Once contacting blood, the microparticles automatically mix with blood via imbibition and covalently crosslink with blood proteins and the tissue matrix before natural coagulation operates, rapidly forming a fortified clot with enhanced mechanical strength and tissue adhesion. In contrast to commercial hemostats, the microparticles achieve rapid hemostasis (within 30 seconds) and less blood loss (approximately 35 mg and 1 g in the rat and coagulopathic pig models, respectively), while effectively preventing blood-pressure-elevation-induced rebleeding in a rabbit model.

Mutations in the CEBPA gene, which are typically biallelic, result in the production of a shorter isoform known as p30. Both the canonical 42-kDa isoform (p42) and the AML-associated p30 isoform bind chromatin and activate transcription, but the specific transcriptional programs controlled by each protein and how they are linked to a selective advantage in AML is not well understood. Here, we show that cells expressing the AML-associated p30 have reduced baseline inflammatory gene expression and display altered dynamics of transcriptional induction in response to LPS, consequently impacting cytokine secretion. This confers p30-expressing cells an increased resistance to the adverse effects of prolonged exposure to inflammatory signals. Mechanistically, we show that these differences primarily arise from the differential regulation of AP-1 family proteins. In addition, we find that the impaired function of the AP-1 member ATF4 in p30-expressing cells alters their response to ER stress.

Interestingly, Ant2−/− naïve T cells exhibit enhanced activation, proliferation and effector functions compared to wild-type controls. Metabolic profiling reveals that these T cells adopt an activated-like metabolic program with increased mitobiogenesis and anabolism. Lastly, pharmacological inhibition of ANT in wild-type T cells recapitulates the Ant2−/− phenotype and improves adoptive T cell therapy of cancer in mouse models. Our findings thus suggest that Ant2-deficient T cells bypass the typical metabolic reprogramming required for activation, leading to enhanced T cell function and highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting ANT for immune modulation. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004432202,Reprogramming

The challenge, however, is to achieve delivery across the selective epithelial cell barrier. Here we report on a subunit vaccine platform, in which the antigen is genetically fused to albumin to facilitate FcRn-mediated transport across the mucosal barrier in the presence of adjuvant. Intranasal delivery in conventional and transgenic mouse models induces both systemic and mucosal antigen-specific antibody responses that protect against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A. When benchmarked against an intramuscularly administered mRNA vaccine or an intranasally administered antigen fused to an alternative carrier of similar size, only the albumin-based intranasal vaccine yields robust mucosal IgA antibody responses. Our results thus suggest that this needle-free, albumin-based vaccine platform may be suited for vaccination against respiratory pathogens. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003980796,Mucosal Immunity

However, most of these materials are excited exclusively by ultraviolet (UV) light, which poses risks to living organisms. Herein, six donor–acceptor-type compounds incorporating triazine groups are designed as guests within doped systems. White-light excitable phosphorescent guests enable doped materials to show efficient afterglow under white-light excitation. By leveraging the ability of white-light to penetrate biological tissues, a bioimaging mode in which the materials are first concentrated within the organism and then excited was developed, yielding superior imaging effects compared with the traditional method in which materials are first excited and then concentrated. Furthermore, these materials are applied in imaging diagnosis of atherosclerosis plaques (male Apoe−/− mice) and intestinal diseases (female BALB/c-nude mice), as well as in navigation for in situ liver tumor surgery (female BALB/c-nude mice), achieving excellent imaging outcomes.

We test our transcriptome mining pipeline towards the diversification of moroidins, which are plant ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally-modified peptides (RiPPs) biosynthesized from copper-dependent peptide cyclases. Moroidins are bicyclic compounds with a conserved stephanotic acid scaffold, which becomes cytotoxic to non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma cells with an additional C-terminal macrocycle. We discover moroidin analogs with second ring structures diversified at the crosslink and the non-crosslinked residues including a moroidin analog from water chickweed, which exhibits higher cytotoxicity against lung adenocarcinoma cells than moroidin.

Using single-cell sequencing, we identify several immune cells that were up to 100-fold expanded in the kidney vasculature, including macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), and B cells. Regeneration after AKI is characterized by sustained remodeling of the renal microvascular interface. Homeostatic microvascular C1q+ macrophages withdraw from the vascular barrier which is subsequently repopulated by new subsets, including CD11c+F480+ and CD11c+F480− cells. These newly arrived macrophages exhibit enhanced phagocytic activity toward circulating bacteria and secretion of tumor necrosis factor, pointing to maladaptive repair mechanisms after AKI.

Second, we append a lipid chain to a lysine side chain in a fashion designed to anchor the peptide to the cell membrane as the ligand is bound to the receptor and hence increase its dwell time on the receptor.

Yet, the mechanism underlying HIRI remains unclear. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) facilitates the conversion of nicotinamide into N1-methylnicotinamide (1-MNA) and plays crucial roles in various pathophysiological processes. In this study, we find a decrease in hepatic NNMT expression and serum 1-MNA levels during HIRI. Both NNMT overexpression and exogenous 1-MNA treatment alleviate HIRI in male mice HIRI models and primary hepatocytes H/R models. Mechanistically, NNMT/1-MNA plays key roles in inflammation, apoptosis, and vascular injury during HIRI through the AKT/FOXO1/ANGPT2/JNK axis. Hepatic-specific depletion of NNMT leads to increased ANGPT2 expression and exacerbates HIRI, effects that can be mitigated by ANGPT2 knockdown.

The most potent modifiers exhibit an uncommon dual mode of action, wherein nucleation is suppressed by altering prenucleation clusters and crystal surface growth is impeded irreversibly by inducing lattice strain.

Nevertheless, its inherent limitations necessitate innovative solutions. One promising strategy is to develop reagents with enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency under long-wavelength laser irradiation. Carbon nanomaterials, known for their broad absorption spectra, are currently hindered by single-wavelength lasers in clinical treatments. In this study, we address this limitation by coating mesoporous carbon nanomaterials (MCNs) with a lanthanide oxysulfide up-conversion material (Y2O2S:Yb3+,Er3+), converting 980 nm light into visible light.

To obtain the iron required for growth, many bacterial pathogens encode transporters capable of extracting the iron-containing cofactor heme directly from host proteins. Pathogenic E. coli and Shigella spp. produce the outer membrane transporter ChuA, which binds host hemoglobin and extracts its heme cofactor, before importing heme into the cell. Heme extraction by ChuA is a dynamic process, with the transporter capable of rapidly extracting heme from hemoglobin in the absence of an external energy source, without forming a stable ChuA-hemoglobin complex. In this work, we utilise a combination of structural modelling, Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and phenotypic analysis to understand the mechanistic detail of this process. Based on this understanding we utilise artificial intelligence-based protein design to create binders capable of inhibiting E. coli growth by blocking hemoglobin binding to ChuA. By screening a limited number of these designs, we identify several binders that inhibit E. coli growth at low nanomolar concentrations, without experimental optimisation.

Here, we unexpectedly discover that, unlike chimpanzee and other primates, a critical embryonic development, immune homeostasis, and general cell-death regulator protein called Fas Ligand (FasL) contains a Pro153-Ser153 evolutionary substitution in humans. The latter renders human FasL preferentially susceptible to cleavage by plasmin, an overly elevated protease in solid tumors. Since FasL-mediated killing of tumor cells by activated T-lymphocytes and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) is critical for therapeutic efficacy, we find that elevated plasmin levels in certain ovarian tumors interfere with the T-lymphocyte-expressed FasL death signaling. Either targeted inhibition or blocking plasmin accessibility to membrane FasL rescues the FasL cell-death function of activated T-lymphocytes in response to immune-checkpoint receptor targeting antibodies. These findings of evolutionary significance highlight that elevated plasmin in metastatic tumors potentially contributes to differential outcomes of T-cell-based immunotherapies in solid tumors. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009739279,Fas ligand

However, its benefits remain ambiguous. We postulate that the use of red blood cells (RBCs) and associated secondary hemolysis may in fact cause renal injury, offsetting potential advantages. During 48-hour normothermic perfusion of seven human donor kidneys, we observed progressive hemolysis, leading to iron accumulation in perfusate and tissue. Untargeted lipidomic profiling revealed significant increases in oxidized phospholipid species in perfused kidneys, pointing towards iron-dependent cell death known as ferroptosis. Next, in twelve additional perfusions, we assessed strategies to mitigate hemolysis-driven injury. Dialysis-based free hemoglobin removal reduced lipid peroxidation, but a ferroptosis gene signature persisted. In contrast, cell-free perfusion at subnormothermia negated iron accumulation, the ferroptosis gene signature, phospholipid peroxidation, and acute kidney injury.

Modulating these condensates offers a promising way to durably inhibit disease-driving proteins that lack enzymatic activity and thus elude traditional drug targeting. However, many such proteins remain beyond the reach of current condensate-modulating strategies. Here we show an alternative approach: by destabilizing target proteins, we directly induce their liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), causing them to form condensates. Using this strategy, we develop a small molecule RQ that forces β-catenin (an oncogenic protein in liver cancer) into cytoplasmic condensates. This sequestration prevents β-catenin from entering the nucleus and activating cancer-promoting genes. In nanoparticle form (albumin-bound Abroquinone), RQ is selectively taken up by β-catenin-driven liver cancer cells and kills them while sparing normal cells. This approach suppresses β-catenin-driven tumor growth and overcomes immune evasion, demonstrating a promising paradigm for targeting previously untargetable proteins by inducing their phase separation. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009742094,Liquid liquid; Liquid phase; Separation (statistics)

Excursions from normality include diagnostic markers and causes of disease. Rapid and persistent changes in the levels and functions of circulating blood components can reflect the functions of multiple endocytic lectin receptors. The majority of non-albumin blood proteins are post-translationally modified with sialylated N-glycans bearing cryptic ligands of various endocytic lectin receptors. During time in circulation, these cryptic ligands are progressively unmasked thereby contributing to glycoprotein half-life and abundance. The relationships between distinct lectin receptors and their endogenous ligand repertoires are not easily established. Herein we apply a glycosidic linkage enrichment strategy to identify accumulating mannosylated plasma glycoproteins linked to the absence of the endocytic Mrc1 (MMR, CD206) mannose-binding lectin receptor. We find that Mrc1 controls the abundance of over two hundred circulating endogenous mannosylated proteins in healthy mice at steady state, including glycoproteins linked to inflammation, age-associated organ dysfunction, and elevated mortality in sepsis. Increased circulating Mrc1 levels previously ascribed to proteolysis during sepsis are proportional to mannosylated protein accumulation in the blood.

Recent deep learning methods show great potential in this field but also encounter substantial challenges. These include generating reliable confidence estimates for predictions, enhancing robustness when handling novel, unseen DTIs, and mitigating the tendency toward overconfident and incorrect predictions. To solve these problems, we propose EviDTI, a novel approach utilizing evidential deep learning (EDL) for uncertainty quantification in neural network-based DTI prediction. EviDTI integrates multiple data dimensions, including drug 2D topological graphs and 3D spatial structures, and target sequence features. Through EDL, EviDTI provides uncertainty estimates for its predictions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of EviDTI against 11 baseline models. In addition, our study shows that EviDTI can calibrate prediction errors. More importantly, well-calibrated uncertainty information enhances the efficiency of drug discovery by prioritizing DTIs with higher confident predictions for experimental validation. In a case study focused on tyrosine kinase modulators, uncertainty-guided predictions identify novel potential modulators targeting tyrosine kinase FAK and FLT3. These results underscore the potential of evidential deep learning as a robust tool for uncertainty quantification in DTI prediction and its broader implications for accelerating drug discovery. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011684997,Drug target

Biofilms, which are bacterial communities encased in an extracellular polysaccharide matrix, contribute to approximately 80% of these infections. In particular, pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are frequently co-isolated from the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis and are commonly found in chronic wound infections. Within biofilms, bacteria demonstrate a remarkable increase in resistance and tolerance to antimicrobial treatment. We investigated the efficacy of combining the last-line antibiotic colistin with a membrane- and stringent stress response-targeting anti-biofilm peptide DJK-5 against co-biofilms comprised of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Colistin lacks canonical activity against S. aureus. However, our study revealed that under co-biofilm conditions, the antibiofilm peptide DJK-5 synergized with colistin against S. aureus. Similar enhancement was observed when daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide against Gram-positive bacteria, was combined with DJK-5, resulting in increased activity against P. aeruginosa. The combinatorial treatment induced morphological changes in both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus cell shape and size within co-biofilms. Importantly, our findings also demonstrate synergistic activity against both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in a murine subcutaneous biofilm-like abscess model. In conclusion, combinatorial treatments with colistin or daptomycin and the anti-biofilm peptide DJK-5 show significant potential for targeting co-biofilm infections.

Though it is well acknowledged that microgravity provides necessary mechanical force signals for cell fate2, how microgravity affects growth, differentiation, and communication is still largely unknown due to the lack of real experimental scenarios and reproducibility tools. Here, Rotating Flat Chamber (RFC) was used to simulate ground-based microgravity effects to study how microgravity effects affect the differentiation of HepaRG (hepatic progenitor cells) cells. Unexpectedly, the results show that RFC conditions could promote HepaRG cell differentiation which exhibited increased expression of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin (ALB), and Recombinant Cytokeratin 18 (CK18). Through screening a series of mechanical receptors, the ion channel TRPML1 was critical for promoting the differentiation effect under RFC conditions. Once TRPML1 was activated by stimulated microgravity effects, the concentration of lysosomal calcium ions was increased to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which finally led to enhanced cell differentiation of HepaRG cells. In addition, the cytoskeleton was remodeled under RFC conditions to influence the expression of PI (3,5) P2, which is the best-known activator of TRPML1. In summary, our findings have established a mechanism by which simulated microgravity promotes the differentiation of HepaRG cells through the TRPML1 signaling pathway, which provides a potential target for the regulation of hepatic stem/progenitor cell differentiation and embryonic liver development under real microgravity conditions.

In multivariate logistic regression model adjusting for confounding factors, MPO activity (not concentration) is the factor that is most associated with PD status (OR, 6.921, P = 0.001). Mental depression is directly associated with MPO activity and with PD status (OR, 0.121, B = −2.108, P = 0.002). The use of statins or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs significantly reduces serum MPO activity, but the possible association with the odds of having PD does not survive correction for multiple testing. In summary, both serum MPO concentration and activity are increased in patients with PD, but only MPO enzyme activity is associated with PD status. These findings may have implications for the evaluation of PD. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003652582,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Here, we used mass-spectrometry to compare blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) KP metabolites between 158 unimpaired older adults and 177 participants with PD. We found increased neuroexcitatory QA/KA ratio in both plasma and CSF of PD participants associated with peripheral and cerebral inflammation and vitamin B6 deficiency. Furthermore, increased QA tracked with CSF tau, CSF soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) and severity of both motor and non-motor PD clinical symptoms. Finally, PD patient subgroups with distinct KP profiles displayed distinct PD clinical features. These data validate the KP as a site of brain and periphery crosstalk, integrating B-vitamin status, inflammation and metabolism to ultimately influence PD clinical manifestation. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003670239,Kynurenic acid; Kynurenine pathway

We conducted a retrospective study of 890 PD patients diagnosed during 2000-2020 and 8,100 matched controls, analyzing electronic health records up to 15 years before PD diagnosis. Prevalence was assessed annually to track changes in association strength over time. PD patients consistently showed lower MetS prevalence (OR = 0.57–0.8). Compared to controls, PD patients had lower triglycerides (OR = 0.44–0.75), BMI (OR = 0.54–0.65), and hyperglycemia (OR = 0.81–0.86) rates, and females showed higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (OR = 1.48–1.82), lower low-density lipoprotein/HDL ratio (OR = 0.46–0.64), and reduced hypertension (OR = 0.79–0.85). These findings suggest an inverse association between MetS and PD years before diagnosis.

We applied an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to predict long-term all-cause mortality in patients with PD using administrative healthcare data collected at PD diagnosis. Among seven machine learning algorithms, XGBoost achieved the best performance (10-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.836; 5-year AUROC: 0.894). The most important contributing feature to PD mortality was age, followed by male sex and pneumonia. Using XAI models, the nonlinear association between contributing factors and PD mortality was assessed, and an optimal target value to reduce mortality was found. In addition, prediction of individualized 10-year mortality risk for each PD participant was possible. Our XAI modeling pipeline demonstrated the feasibility to predict long-term mortality in patients with PD using preexisting healthcare data. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007075513,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This study evaluates peripheral inflammation using serum differential leukocyte counts and their derived ratios. A total of 170 PD patients were retrospectively enrolled from Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital (GDPH) and 68 from PPMI. Partial correlation analysis showed that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) negatively correlated with MoCA in GDPH but not in PPMI. Moreover, peripheral inflammation was shown to correlate with white matter integrity. The result of the longitudinal analysis showed that higher baseline NLR predicted worsening in letter number sequencing (LNS) score. Path analysis indicated that white matter integrity significantly mediated the relationship between NLR and cognitive change in the LNS score from Year 5 to baseline.

However, existing diagnostic approaches rely on invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling or tissue biopsies, limiting their accessibility and scalability in clinical practice. Here, we present the Constant Shake-Induced Conversion (CSIC) assay, a novel plasma-based technique for the detection of αSyn aggregates. A total of 102 participants, comprising 42 PD patients and 60 healthy controls (HCs), were enrolled. Plasma samples were subjected to CSIC and validated via αSyn depletion, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blotting. Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and clinical associations were examined using Spearman’s correlation. The CSIC assay achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91, with 81% sensitivity and 85% specificity in distinguishing PD from HCs. Assay specificity was confirmed through αSyn depletion, and reproducibility assessments yielded intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation below 10% and ~20%, respectively. Notably, plasma αSyn aggregate levels correlated with Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage (r = 0.69), Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (r = 0.68), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r = −0.47).

We hypothesized a greater 20-year multimorbidity incidence in people hospitalized for SARS-CoV-1 infection than those for influenza during similar periods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a territory-wide public healthcare database in Hong Kong. All patients aged ≥15 hospitalized for SARS in 2003 or influenza in 2002 or 2004 with no more than one of 30 listed chronic disease were included. Demographics, clinical history, and medication use were adjusted for in the inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted Poisson regression analyses. We identified 1255 hospitalizations for SARS-CoV-1 infection and 687 hospitalizations for influenza. Overall crude multimorbidity incident rates were 1.5 per 100 person-years among SARS patients and 5.6 among influenza patients. Adjusted multimorbidity incidence rate ratio (IRR) was estimated at 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.70–0.86) for SARS patients compared with influenza patients. Analysis by follow-up period shows a potentially greater risk among SARS patients in the first year of follow-up (IRR 1.33, 95% CI 0.97–1.84), with the risk in influenza patients increasing in subsequent years. Subgroup analyses by age and sex showed consistent results with the main analysis that SARS-CoV-1 infection was not followed by a higher incidence of multimorbidity than influenza. Notable differences in the patterns of multimorbidity were identified between the two arms. To conclude, we found no evidence of a higher multimorbidity incidence after hospitalization for SARS than for influenza over the long-term. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000855177,Multimorbidity; Rate ratio

We have previously demonstrated that alternatively, activated macrophages are a potential therapeutic option to reverse acute liver injury in pre-clinical models. In this paper, we present data using cryopreserved human alternatively activated macrophages (hAAMs)—which represent a potential, rapidly available treatment suitable for use in the acute setting. In a mouse model of APAP-induced injury, peripherally injected cryopreserved hAAMs reduced liver necrosis, modulated inflammatory responses, and enhanced liver regeneration. hAAMs were effective even when administered after the therapeutic window for NAC. This cell therapy approach represents a potential treatment for APAP overdose when NAC is ineffective because liver injury is established. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218193516,Acetaminophen; Antidote; Liver Regeneration; acetaminophen overdose

Thus, we tested whether hippocampal subfield volume deficits link with deviations in glucose metabolism commonly seen in early psychosis, and whether the glucose parameters or subfield volumes change during follow-up period using one-year longitudinal study design of 78 first-episode psychosis patients (FEP), 48 clinical high-risk patients (CHR) and 83 controls (CTR). We also tested whether hippocampal morphology and glucose metabolism relate to clinical outcome. Hippocampus subfields were segmented with Freesurfer from 3T MRI images and parameters of glucose metabolism were determined in fasting plasma samples. Hippocampal subfield volumes were consistently lower in FEPs, and findings were more robust in non-affective psychoses, with strongest decreases in CA1, molecular layer and hippocampal tail, and in hippocampal tail of CHRs, compared to CTRs. These morphometric differences remained stable at one-year follow-up. Both non-diabetic CHRs and FEPs had worse glucose parameters compared to CTRs at baseline. We found that, insulin levels and insulin resistance increased during the follow-up period only in CHR, effect being largest in the CHRs converting to psychosis, independent of exposure to antipsychotics. The worsening of insulin resistance was associated with deterioration of function and symptoms in CHR. The smaller volume of hippocampal tail was associated with higher plasma insulin and insulin resistance in FEPs, at the one-year follow-up. Our longitudinal study supports the view that temporospatial hippocampal subfield volume deficits are stable near the onset of first psychosis, being more robust in non-affective psychoses, but less prominent in the CHR group. Specific subfield defects were related to worsening glucose metabolism during the progression of psychosis, suggesting that hippocampus is part of the circuits regulating aberrant glucose metabolism in early psychosis. Worsening of glucose metabolism in CHR group was associated with worse clinical outcome measures indicating a need for heightened clinical attention to metabolic problems already in CHR. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200037968,Carbohydrate Metabolism

In this study, we developed a deep learning model that integrates demographic, behavioral, and blood test data from admission to forecast extended hospital stays using a retrospective cohort. By utilizing language models, our developed algorithm efficiently extracts 95% of the unstructured electronic health records data needed for this work, while ensuring data privacy and low error rate. This paradigm has also been demonstrated to have significant advantages in reducing potential discrimination and erroneous dependencies. By utilizing multimodal features, our deep learning model achieved a classification accuracy of 0.81 and an AUC of 0.9. Key risk factors identified included advanced age, longer disease duration, and blood markers such as elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lower lymphocyte percentage, and reduced albumin levels, validated through comprehensive interpretability analyses and ablation studies. The inclusion of multimodal data significantly improved prediction performance, with demographic variables alone achieving an accuracy of 0.73, which increased to 0.81 with the addition of behavioral and blood test data.

Additionally, some trials have suggested that vitamin E may benefit TD patients. However, the mechanistic basis for these treatments remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the mechanisms of valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, and vitamin E in TD treatment utilizing network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches. Putative target genes associated with valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, and vitamin E were retrieved from the PharmMapper, CTD, GeneCards, SwissTargetPrediction, and DrugBank databases. TD-related targets were identified using the GeneCards, DisGeNET, OMIM, and TTD databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was created to identify core targets. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted via DAVID, and Cytoscape was used to build a drug-pathway-target-disease network. Molecular docking evaluated drug-target interactions. A total of 32, 36, and 62 targets relevant to the treatment of TD were identified for valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, and vitamin E, respectively. PPI and KEGG pathway analyses suggested that valbenazine and deutetrabenazine may influence TD through the dopaminergic synapse signaling pathway via common core targets (e.g., Dopamine Receptor D1 (DRD1), DRD2, Monoamine Oxidase B (MAOB), Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 3 (SLC6A3), SLC18A2) and specific targets (DRD3 for valbenazine, MAOA for deutetrabenazine). Vitamin E may affect TD by targeting the PI3K-Akt pathway through AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (AKT1), Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Insulin (INS), Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 (NOS3), and Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4). This study provides insights into the common and unique molecular mechanisms by which valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, and vitamin E may treat TD. Pharmacological experiments should be conducted to verify and further explore these results.

This study explored the mechanisms by which the ENaC taste receptor recognizes and binds mushroom-derived salty peptides using molecular interaction and molecular simulation. The three subunits α, β, and γ of the ENaC taste receptor (SCNN1α, SCNN1β, and SCNN1γ) showed different recognition characteristics for the salty peptide. The salty peptide binding to the SCNN1α receptor was an entropy-driven reaction, while to SCNN1β and SCNN1γ was an enthalpy-driven reaction. With the salty peptide spatial resistance increasing, salty peptides bind to the ENaC taste receptor shifted from receptor pockets binding to receptor surface binding, with salty octapeptide ESPERPFL preferentially binding to amino acid residues in the receptor pockets 2, 3, and 4, salty nonapeptide KSWDDFFTR and decapeptide RIEDNLVIIR binding to amino acid residues in the pockets 2, 4 and on the surface of the receptor, and salty undecapeptide GQEDYDRLRPL preferentially binding to the atoms on the surface of the receptor. Receptor extracellular arginine, glutamate, aspartate, and lysine residues were the critical amino acid residues recognized to bind salty peptides. The salty peptide-ENaC receptor binding complex was stable around 0.3 nm, and the tight and multisite binding was the main reason the ENaC receptor sensed the salty peptide, enabling it to exert its taste effect. This research can provide a theoretical basis for understanding the taste properties of salty peptides recognized and perceived by the ENaC taste receptor. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217824212,Epithelial sodium channel; Taste receptor

The complex coacervation-based encapsulation of fish oil in powders is a promising method to improve the behavior of fish oil in food science and engineering. Controlled preparation of fish oil powders has become an important topic in improving their properties. Herein, the fish oil-encapsulated powders were controlled prepared by combining a fish gelatin (FG)-alginate complex coacervation method with an intra-particulate genipin-crosslinking method. The genipin crosslinking did not affect the particle morphologies, moisture contents, and fish oil encapsulation ability. However, it did affect other physicochemical properties, fish oil oxidation ability, and in vitro digestion behaviors. Especially, the genipin-to-FG mass ratio of 1.0% induced the lowest water activity (0.45 ± 0.01), highest tapped density (0.107 ± 0.007 g/cm3), highest Carr indexes (58% ± 2%), highest Hausner ratios (2.43 ± 0.13), lowest peak value (636.0 ± 10.0 μm) of the powder sizes, and lowest peroxide peak value (442 ± 3 mmol/kg oil).

This study evaluated the protective effect of selenium-enriched Bifidobacterium longum DD98 (SeDD98) on irinotecan-induced intestinal mucositis. Irinotecan caused intestinal mucositis, characterized by weight loss, severe diarrhea, damaged intestinal structure, reduced tight junction proteins, and gut dysbiosis. These effects could be inhibited by SeDD98. Additionally, fecal microbiota from SeDD98-treated mice protected against intestinal mucositis. Mechanistically, irinotecan activated the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) / nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway, whereas SeDD98 and fecal microbiota from SeDD98-treated mice suppressed this activation. Furthermore, depletion of gut microbiota by a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (ABX) blunted the protective effect of SeDD98 and its inhibition of the STING/NF-κB pathway. These findings suggest that SeDD98 could protect against intestinal mucositis via inhibiting the STING/NF-κB pathway, likely through improving gut microbiota. Overall, SeDD98 may be a potential therapeutic agent for preventing chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis via gut microbiome improvement. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008529298,Dysbiosis; Mucositis

However, the potential for BA1b to improve glucose metabolism and the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. We examined the effects of BA1b on glucose metabolism in diabetic mice and further studied the effects of BA1b on intestinal cells based on small intestinal organoids (SIOs). The results showed that BA1b significantly reduced blood glucose and serum insulin levels, promoted secretion of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in diabetic mice. Similarly, BA1b significantly increased the secretion of GIP and GLP-1 levels in SIOs. Mechanistic studies found that BA1b promoted the secretion of incretin (GIP and GLP-1) by up-regulation of VDAC1 gene expression levels. These findings emphasized the important role of BA1b in improving glucose metabolism and provided a new insight into strategies to explore the effects of functional foods. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008782683,Carbohydrate Metabolism

However, sheep breeding is inevitably influenced by various factors, including feed mycotoxin contamination and parasitic infection. In this study, we investigated the effect of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and Eimeria ovinoidalis (EO) on sheep meat quality following a two-week treatment. The results showed that oxidative stress triggered by EO or AFB1 in feed could cause significant changes in meat quality. Metabolomics and transcriptomics further revealed that the alteration in mutton quality is closely associated with glycolysis mediated by the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) pathway. Interestingly, the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2), a downstream gene of the HIF-1α pathway, exhibits a strong affinity for AFB1 and its metabolites, as revealed by molecular docking analysis, which is associated with a change in mutton quality-related indices. These findings provide novel insights that Eimeria or/and AFB1 compromise mutton quality by disrupting the HIF-1α/HK2/glycolysis axis. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009917204,Hexokinase

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as an effective tool for identifying novel biomarkers and enhancing predictive modelling. However, sex-based bias in ML algorithms remains a concern. This study developed a supervised ML model to predict nine common clinical biomarkers, including triglycerides, BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, uric acid, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, high-density lipoproteins, and albuminuria. The model’s predictions were within 5–10% error of actual values. For predictions within 10% error, the top performing models were waist circumference, albuminuria, BMI, blood glucose and systolic blood pressure, with males scoring higher than females, followed by the combined data set containing sex as an input feature and the combined data without sex as an input feature performing the poorest.

Despite multiple studies reporting this connection, the mechanism by which T2D exacerbates AD is poorly understood. It is challenging to design studies that address co-occurring and comorbid diseases, limiting the number of existing evidence bases. To address this challenge, we expanded the applications of a computational framework called Translatable Components Regression (TransComp-R), initially designed for cross-species translation modeling, to perform cross-disease modeling to identify biological programs of T2D that may exacerbate AD pathology. Using TransComp-R, we combined peripheral blood-derived T2D and AD human transcriptomic data to identify T2D principal components predictive of AD status. Our model revealed genes enriched for biological pathways associated with inflammation, metabolism, and signaling pathways from T2D principal components predictive of AD. The same T2D PC predictive of AD outcomes unveiled sex-based differences across the AD datasets. We performed a gene expression correlational analysis to identify therapeutic hypotheses tailored to the T2D-AD axis. We identified six T2D and two dementia medications that induced gene expression profiles associated with a non-T2D or non-AD state. We next assessed our blood-based T2DxAD biomarker signature in post-mortem human AD and control brain gene expression data from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. Using partial least squares discriminant analysis, we identified a subset of genes from our cross-disease blood-based biomarker panel that significantly separated AD and control brain samples. Finally, we validated our findings using single cell RNA-sequencing blood data of AD and healthy individuals and found erythroid cells contained the most gene expression signatures to the T2D PC. Our methodological advance in cross-disease modeling identified biological programs in T2D that may predict the future onset of AD in this population. This, paired with our therapeutic gene expression correlational analysis, also revealed alogliptin, a T2D medication that may help prevent the onset of AD in T2D patients. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006893052,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We identified a cyclic deca-peptide incorporating lipoamino acids for delivering T helper and B cell epitopes against group A Streptococcus (GAS), eliciting robust humoral immune responses. In this study, we assessed the function-immunogenicity relationship of the multi-component vaccine candidate (referred to as VC-13) to elucidate a mechanism of action. We identified a potential universal delivery platform, not only capable of adjuvanting different peptide epitopes (e.g., NS1 and 88/30 from group A Streptococcus, gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone [GnRH]), but also protein antigens (e.g., bovine serum albumin [BSA], receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 protein responsible for COVID-19 infection [SARS-CoV-2 RBD]) and small molecular haptens (e.g., cocaine). All vaccine candidates self-assembled into sub-500 nm nanoparticles and induced high antigen-specific systemic IgG titers and opsonic potential compared to the antigen co-administered with a commercial adjuvant, complete Freund’s adjuvant. Notably, presence of the cyclic decapeptide in this vaccine increased accumulation in the draining inguinal lymph nodes, facilitating cellular uptake of peptide antigens. Furthermore, the lipoamino acid promoted dendritic cell activation, acting as both toll-like receptors 2 and 4 -targeting moiety.

In this work, we have adapted and fine-tuned various reported mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) synthesis and preparation procedures, evaluated a range of ionizable cationic lipids, and identified top-performing LNP formulations. The impact of uridine modification on mRNA’s ability to trigger immune responses has also been explored. Our findings indicate that both unmodified mRNA and N1-methyl pseudouridine-modified mRNA successfully induced an antigen-specific antibody response in mice, while the methoxy uridine-modified mRNA did not. Based on these studies, we constructed a bivalent Fluvid mRNA vaccine, consisting of LNPs encapsulating uridine-unmodified mRNA encoding either a transmembrane domain-deleted hemagglutinin or the full-length native spike protein. This vaccine stimulated robust T cell and B cell immune responses and conferred 100% protective efficacy against challenge with either influenza or SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the mouse model, without compromising efficacy compared to administering each monovalent vaccine individually.

This was used to identify phage marker genes and their integration into the MetaPhlAn 4 bacterial marker gene database enabled simultaneous assessment of phage and bacterial dynamics. We found that individual children are colonized by hundreds of different phages, which are more transitory than bacteria, accumulating a more diverse phage community over time. Type 1 diabetes correlated with a decreased rate of change in bacterial and viral communities in children aged one and two. The addition of phage data improved the ability of machine learning models to discriminate samples by country.

However, understanding radical pairs and their quantum nature in biological systems is still in its infancy, which is due to the limitation of high-sensitivity instrumentation.

The system design presented here is a new optical system to capture the quantum mechanical nature of biology with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Our magneto-fluorescence fluctuation microspectroscopic approach has the capability of measuring magnetic field effects as low as 0.2% on fluorescence signals near the single-photon level with single-photon avalanche diodes, and is demonstrated by magnetic field effects on 23 molecules. An additional detection system in the form of an EMCCD camera offers spatially resolved magnetic field effects with a novel post hoc digital lock-in amplifier for phase-sensitive camera detection.

Our theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed bubble and cell dynamic responses. We find that cyclic jets arise from shape instabilities, as opposed to classical inertial jets that are driven by pressure gradients, enabling microjet formation at mild ultrasound pressures below 100 kPa. We also establish a threshold for bubble radial expansion beyond which microjets form and facilitate cellular permeation and show that the stress generated by microjetting outperforms previously suggested mechanisms by at least an order of magnitude.

CKD can be the consequence of a single cause, but CKD in adults frequently relates rather to sequential injuries accumulating over the life course or to the presence of concomitant risk factors. The shared pathomechanism of CKD progression is the irreversible loss of kidney cells or nephrons together with haemodynamic and metabolic overload of the remaining nephrons, leading to further loss of kidney cells or nephrons.

Until now, porcine hearts and kidneys have been successively transplanted into humans3, 4, 5, 6–7. In this study, heterotopic auxiliary transplantation was used to donate a six-gene-edited pig liver to a brain-dead recipient. The graft function, haemodynamics, and immune and inflammatory responses of the recipient were monitored over the subsequent 10 days. Two hours after portal vein reperfusion of the xenograft, goldish bile was produced, increasing to 66.5 ml by postoperative day 10. Porcine liver-derived albumin also increased after surgery. Alanine aminotransferase levels remained in the normal range, while aspartate aminotransferase levels increased on postoperative day 1 and then rapidly declined. Blood flow velocity in the porcine hepatic artery and portal and hepatic veins remained at an acceptable level. Although platelet numbers decreased early after surgery, they ultimately returned to normal levels. Histological analyses showed that the porcine liver regenerated capably with no signs of rejection. T cell activity was inhibited by anti-thymocyte globulin administration, and B cell activation increased 3 days after surgery and was then inhibited by rituximab. There were no significant peri-operative changes in immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin M levels. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were initially elevated and then quickly declined. The xenograft remained functional until study completion. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001487866,Human liver; Pig liver; Xenotransplantation

Clinical translation of SERS nanoprobes has been hampered by biosafety concerns about the metal substrates used to enhance Raman signals. We report a set of small molecules with bis-thienyl-substituted benzobisthiadiazole structures that enhance Raman signal through self-stacking rather than external substrates. In our technique, called stacking-induced charge transfer-enhanced Raman scattering (SICTERS), the self-stacked small molecules form an ordered spatial arrangement that enables three-dimensional charge transfer between neighboring molecules. The Raman scattering cross-section of SICTERS nanoprobes is 1350 times higher than that of conventional SERS gold nanoprobes of similar particle size. SICTERS outperforms SERS in terms of in vivo imaging sensitivity, resolution and depth. SICTERS is capable of noninvasive Raman imaging of blood and lymphatic vasculatures, which has not been achieved by SERS. SICTERS represents an alternative technique to enhance Raman scattering for guiding the design of ultrasensitive substrate-free Raman imaging probes. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201647224,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Using rare variant aggregation testing based on whole-exome sequencing data to detect genes associated with levels of 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites, we discovered 235 gene–metabolite associations, many previously unreported. Complementary approaches (genetic, computational (in silico gene knockouts in whole-body models of human metabolism) and one experimental proof of principle) provided orthogonal evidence that studies of rare, damaging variants in the heterozygous state permit inferences concordant with those from inborn errors of metabolism. Allelic series of functional variants in transporters responsible for transcellular sulfate reabsorption (SLC13A1, SLC26A1) exhibited graded effects on plasma sulfate and human height and pinpointed alleles associated with increased odds of diverse musculoskeletal traits and diseases in the population.

While transcription master regulators induce lineage-specific genes to restrict plasticity, it remains unclear whether plasticity is actively suppressed by lineage-specific repressors. Here we computationally predict so-called safeguard repressors for 18 cell types that block phenotypic plasticity lifelong. We validated hepatocyte-specific candidates using reprogramming, revealing that prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1) enhanced hepatocyte identity by direct repression of alternative fate master regulators. In mice, Prox1 was required for efficient hepatocyte regeneration after injury and was sufficient to prevent liver tumorigenesis. In line with patient data, Prox1 depletion caused hepatocyte fate loss in vivo and enabled the transition of hepatocellular carcinoma to cholangiocarcinoma. Conversely, overexpression promoted cholangiocarcinoma to hepatocellular carcinoma transdifferentiation. Our findings provide evidence for PROX1 as a hepatocyte-specific safeguard and support a model where cell-type-specific repressors actively suppress plasticity throughout life to safeguard lineage identity and thus prevent disease. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217764631,Cell fate determination; Hepatocyte nuclear factors; Reprogramming; Transdifferentiation

RLR signaling also triggers glycolytic reprogramming through glucose transporters (GLUTs), whose role in antiviral immunity is elusive. Here, we unveil that insulin-responsive GLUT4 inhibits RLR signaling independently of glucose uptake in adipose and muscle tissues. At steady state, GLUT4 is trapped at the Golgi matrix by ubiquitin regulatory X domain 9 (UBXN9, TUG). Following RNA virus infection, GLUT4 is released and translocated to the cell surface where it spatially segregates a significant pool of cytosolic RLRs, preventing them from activating IFN-β responses. UBXN9 deletion prompts constitutive GLUT4 translocation, sequestration of RLRs and attenuation of antiviral immunity, whereas GLUT4 deletion heightens RLR signaling. Notably, reduced GLUT4 expression is uniquely associated with human inflammatory myopathies characterized by hyperactive interferon responses. Overall, our results demonstrate a noncanonical UBXN9-GLUT4 axis that controls antiviral immunity via plasma membrane tethering of cytosolic RLRs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc. 2024.",,Final,All Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209687834,GLUT4; RIG-I

However, an updated and comprehensive assessment of the global burden attributable to SSBs remains scarce. Here we estimated SSB-attributable T2D and CVD burdens across 184 countries in 1990 and 2020 globally, regionally and nationally, incorporating data from the Global Dietary Database, jointly stratified by age, sex, educational attainment and urbanicity. In 2020, 2.2 million (95% uncertainty interval 2.0–2.3) new T2D cases and 1.2 million (95% uncertainty interval 1.1–1.3) new CVD cases were attributable to SSBs worldwide, representing 9.8% and 3.1%, respectively, of all incident cases. Globally, proportional SSB-attributable burdens were higher among men versus women, younger versus older adults, higher- versus lower-educated adults, and adults in urban versus rural areas. By world region, the highest SSB-attributable percentage burdens were in Latin America and the Caribbean (T2D: 24.4%; CVD: 11.3%) and sub-Saharan Africa (T2D: 21.5%; CVD: 10.5%). From 1990 to 2020, the largest proportional increases in SSB-attributable incident T2D and CVD cases were in sub-Saharan Africa (+8.8% and +4.4%, respectively).

Although restrictive eligibility criteria contribute to this issue, the role of selection bias related to prognostic risk remains unclear. In this study, we developed TrialTranslator, a framework designed to systematically evaluate the generalizability of RCTs for oncology therapies. Using a nationwide database of electronic health records from Flatiron Health, this framework emulates RCTs across three prognostic phenotypes identified through machine learning models. We applied this approach to 11 landmark RCTs that investigated anti-cancer regimens considered standard of care for the four most prevalent advanced solid malignancies. Our analyses reveal that patients in low-risk and medium-risk phenotypes exhibit survival times and treatment-associated survival benefits similar to those observed in RCTs. In contrast, high-risk phenotypes show significantly lower survival times and treatment-associated survival benefits compared to RCTs. Our results were corroborated by a comprehensive robustness assessment, including examinations of specific patient subgroups, holdout validation and semi-synthetic data simulation. These findings suggest that the prognostic heterogeneity among real-world oncology patients plays a substantial role in the limited generalizability of RCT results. Machine learning frameworks may facilitate individual patient-level decision support and estimation of real-world treatment benefits to guide trial design. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213987407,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In the SUMMIT trial, patients with HFpEF and obesity were randomized to the long-acting glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide (n = 364, 200 women) or placebo (n = 367, 193 women). As reported separately, tirzepatide decreased cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure. Here, in this mechanistic secondary analysis of the SUMMIT trial, tirzepatide treatment at 52 weeks, as compared with placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure (estimated treatment difference (ETD) −5 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) −7 to −3; P < 0.001), decreased estimated blood volume (ETD −0.58 l, 95% CI −0.63 to −0.52; P < 0.001) and reduced C-reactive protein levels (ETD −37.2%, 95% CI −45.7 to −27.3; P < 0.001). These changes were coupled with an increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (ETD 2.90 ml min−1 1.73 m−2 yr−1, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.86; P = 0.004), a decrease in urine albumin–creatinine ratio (ETD 24 weeks, −25.0%, 95% CI −36 to −13%; P < 0.001; 52 weeks, −15%, 95% CI −28 to 0.1; P = 0.051), a reduction in N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide levels (ETD 52 weeks −10.5%, 95% CI −20.7 to 1.0%; P = 0.07) and a reduction in troponin T levels (ETD 52 weeks −10.4%, 95% CI −16.7 to −3.6; P = 0.003). In post hoc exploratory analyses, decreased estimated blood volume with tirzepatide treatment was significantly correlated with decreased blood pressure, reduced microalbuminuria, improved Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score and increased 6-min walk distance. Moreover, decreased C-reactive protein levels were correlated with reduced troponin T levels and improved 6-min walk distance. In conclusion, tirzepatide reduced circulatory volume–pressure overload and systemic inflammation and mitigated cardiovascular–kidney end-organ injury in patients with HFpEF and obesity, providing new insights into the mechanisms of benefit from tirzepatide.

To address this, we developed and evaluated SCORPIO, a machine learning system that utilizes routine blood tests (complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic profile) alongside clinical characteristics from 9,745 ICI-treated patients across 21 cancer types. SCORPIO was trained on data from 1,628 patients across 17 cancer types from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In two internal test sets comprising 2,511 patients across 19 cancer types, SCORPIO achieved median time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC(t)) values of 0.763 and 0.759 for predicting overall survival at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months, outperforming tumor mutational burden (TMB), which showed median AUC(t) values of 0.503 and 0.543. Additionally, SCORPIO demonstrated superior predictive performance for predicting clinical benefit (tumor response or prolonged stability), with AUC values of 0.714 and 0.641, compared to TMB (AUC = 0.546 and 0.573). External validation was performed using 10 global phase 3 trials (4,447 patients across 6 cancer types) and a real-world cohort from the Mount Sinai Health System (1,159 patients across 18 cancer types). In these external cohorts, SCORPIO maintained robust performance in predicting ICI outcomes, surpassing programmed death-ligand 1 immunostaining. These findings underscore SCORPIO’s reliability and adaptability, highlighting its potential to predict patient outcomes with ICI therapy across diverse cancer types and healthcare settings. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214102017,Cancer Immunotherapy

In a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, phase 2 randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN10368050) in n = 51 adult patients with compensated cirrhosis and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score ≥10 and ≤17, we evaluated the efficacy of autologous monocyte-derived macrophage therapy (n = 27) compared to standard medical care (n = 24). The primary endpoint was the difference in baseline to day 90 change in MELD score (ΔMELD) between treatment and control groups (ΔΔMELD). Secondary endpoints included adverse clinical outcomes, non-invasive fibrosis biomarkers and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 90 d, 180 d and 360 d. The ΔΔMELD between day 0 and day 90 in the treatment group compared to controls was −0.87 (95% confidence interval: −1.79, 0.0; P = 0.06); therefore, the primary endpoint was not met. During 360-d follow-up, five of 24 participants in the control group developed a total of 10 severe adverse events, four of which were liver related, and three deaths (two liver related), whereas no liver-related severe adverse events or deaths occurred in the treatment group. Although no differences were observed in biomarkers or HRQoL, exploratory analysis showed anti-inflammatory serum cytokine profiles after macrophage infusion.

We developed vertical silicon nanopillar (SiNP) arrays for on-chip multiplex capture of selected biomolecules using a light-induced release of the array’s selectively captured biomarkers. This platform allows the rapid, reusable and quantitative capture and release of a selection of biomarkers, followed by their downstream analysis. Here we outline a standardized protocol for producing the SiNP-based capture-and-release device, which involves the detailed fabrication steps for single-zone nanopillar arrays, their morphological characterization and the chemical modification procedures applied for the anchoring of selective bioreceptors together with the light-controlled on-demand release of the chemical agent. In addition, we provide a detailed approach for the fabrication of a multizone-SiNP array, allowing the simultaneous capture and release of multiple biomarkers of interest. Finally, we demonstrate the entire process of selective and quantitative capture and release of biomolecules from biosamples by means of a commercial low-volume microplate reader system, using green fluorescent protein as a biomarker example. The entire protocol can be conducted within 45 h and requires knowledge in nanoscience, surface chemistry, device micro- and nanofabrication procedures, microfluidics and protein quantification techniques.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is capable of causing severe and fatal diseases. We evaluated the antiviral properties of Aspergillus tamarii SP73-EGY isolate extract against low pathogenic coronavirus (229E), Adeno-7- and Herpes-2 viruses. The extract showed a high selectivity index (SI = 43.4) and a significant inhibition of 229E (IC50 = 8.205 μg/ml). It was stronger than the drug control, remdesivir (IC50 = 38.2 μg/ml, SI = 7.29). However, the extract showed minimal efficacy against Adeno-7- and Herpes-2-Viruses (IC50 = 22.52, 47.79 μg/ml, and SI = 6.75, 5.08, respectively). It exhibited profound efficacy against the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 = 8.306 μg/ml, SI = 42.2). Kojic acid, the primary component of the extract, showed substantial antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 = 23.4 μg/ml, SI = 5.6), Remdesivir (IC50 = 4.55 μg/ml, SI = 61.45). Therefore, the extract demonstrated the most notable antiviral characteristics against coronavirus infection. Co-infecting microorganisms may contribute to immune system deterioration and airway injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. The extract showed significant efficacy against E. coli and P. aeruginosa, with an inhibition range of 3.5–10 mm at a concentration of 200 mg/ml. A molecular docking study showed that hexadecanoic, Kojic, octanoic acids, and 4(4-Methylbenzylidene)cyclohexane-1,3-dione have stronger binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than Remdesivir. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to examine the structural stability and flexibility of these complexes.

Ali S.M.,Biomass derived carbon/platinum nanoparticles as electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution,2025,Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-024-84727-z,"Green hydrogen is gaining a significant attention in the transition to sustainable energy and achieving net-zero emissions. Platinum-based catalysts are highly regarded in hydrogen production, particularly due to their efficiency in water electrolysis. Platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) is successively prepared by the microwave-assistant citrate method on a biomass-based support, and characterized by X-rays diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The chelation and gelation resulted by using citric acid during the synthesis lead to the formation of highly stabilized and dispersed Pt NPs on the carbon support. The electrocatalytic activity of Pt NPs for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is examined by cathodic linear polarization and impedance spectroscopy. A high catalytic performance is shown by the prepared sample, as indicated by the calculated exchange current density 5.3 mA/cm2, and activation energy, 38.13 kJ/mol. The HER follows Volmer/Tafel mechanism with a reaction order of unity. Impedance spectra confirms the high electrocatalytic activity by the decrease of the total impedance, pore resistance, and charge-transfer resistance, with increasing the applied overpotential. The proposed synthesis method offers a green, economic, and efficient route for preparing precious metals used for catalytic applications. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218185759,Exchange current density; Overpotential

Latent fingerprints, often visualized with black magnetic powder and recovered with adhesive tape, can be matched to police databases for identification. However, determining the time since deposition (TSD) is crucial to temporally tie the fingerprints to the crime. Despite extensive efforts, no reliable method exists for determining TSD. This study presents a workflow for directly dating fingerprints using ultrafast 2-dimensional desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS). The fingerprints are analyzed directly from a forensic tape after development with magnetic powder. This method aims to enable dating of fingerprints collected from virtually any non-porous surface. The study involved 744 fingerprints from 330 volunteers, aged up to 15 days under various conditions. Data analysis using the XGBoost and SMOTE algorithms achieved a correlation of 0.54 (p-value < 1e−5) between TSD prediction and true TSD, achieving 83.3% accuracy in distinguishing between 0-4 days and 10–15 days old prints. Key imaging parameters, such as DESI-MS scan rate, mass range, scan area, spatial resolution, and imaging mode, were optimized to enhance age determination precision and support rapid processing within forensic workflows. This research, conducted in collaboration between police forensic units and an academic institution, integrates seamlessly into practical forensic applications. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006458483,Deposition

Through systematic literature searching, the titles and abstracts of 23,707 related papers were initially screened, ultimately including 16 papers covering 17 prediction models. The results reveal that among these models, a total of 16 predictive variables were chosen at least twice, with age, diabetes history, and history of cardiovascular disease being the primary predictors. Regarding model validation, 14 models underwent internal validation, 3 models underwent external validation, while 3 models were not subjected to any form of validation. Additionally, calibration testing was performed on 14 models. Risk of bias assessment showed that only 1 model was rated as low risk bias, while the other models were rated as high risk bias due to issues with study cohort characteristics and methodology. Meta-analysis results showed that the combined C-statistic for 13 prediction models was 0.80 (95%CI = 0.74, 0.86), and no significant publication bias was detected. Thus, future construction and validation of prediction models should strictly follow reliable methodological standards and enhance external validation to provide more reliable evidence-based guidance for predicting cardiovascular event risk in maintenance hemodialysis patients. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009548971,Cardiovascular event

Individual ECM components have previously been shown to support endothelial differentiation; here, we use a Design of Experiments approach to optimize ECM composition to more effectively drive endothelial differentiation. We found that a combination of Collagen I, Collagen IV, and Laminin 411 could induce endothelial differentiation well beyond that found with Matrigel, the most commonly used differentiation substrate for endothelial cells. We also show that the addition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during differentiation improves outcomes and that transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) inhibits specification. The optimized ECM formulation (EO) was subsequently used to create bioprinted constructs, demonstrating its ability to spatially define endothelial differentiation in 3D environments. Our results build our mechanistic knowledge of the signaling axes that regulate differentiation in response to ECM stimulation with practical implications for the vascularization of engineered tissues. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010204167,Matrix (chemical analysis)

This research aims to evaluate the causal relationships between vitamin D and these kidney diseases using a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. We obtained summary-level data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on serum 25(OH)D levels, IgAN, MN, and DN to assess the causal impact of vitamin D on these kidney diseases. The primary method used for MR analysis was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach. To further ascertain the stability and reliability of our results, we performed sensitivity analyses including Cochran’s Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and leave-one-out analysis, which helped identify potential pleiotropy and outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing the associations. Our analysis revealed no causal relationships between serum 25(OH)D levels and the risks of IgAN, MN, and DN. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the MR findings. This MR analysis robustly refutes causal associations between genetically determined 25(OH)D levels and IgAN, MN, and DN. These null findings challenge the paradigm of vitamin D supplementation as a preventive strategy for these nephropathies, urging clinicians to prioritize interventions targeting modifiable risk factors over vitamin D optimization in kidney disease management. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010029140,Mendelian Randomization

Viscosity assays, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking studies have been extrapolated to investigate the complexes’ interaction with CT-DNA and bovine serum albumin (BSA). Interaction of the complexes with CT-DNA was validated as groove binding mode using UV-Vis absorption spectra as evidenced by their intrinsic binding constants of all wherein TiC1 and TiC2 exhibited higher values (19.4 × 105 and 5.50 × 105 M− 1) of Kb. Gel electrophoresis assay displayed that CT-DNA had a limited cleavage ability when metal complexes with different activators were present. Fluorescence technique also verified the interaction of the complexes with CT-DNA and BSA to demonstrate greater Kb values (2.84 × 104 and 6.42 × 104 M− 1) of the derivatives TiC1 and TiC2. DPPH assay was carried out to determine the radical scavenging activity of the complexes, so in-vitro cytotoxic effect on malignant cell lines was investigated by MTT Assay with MCF7 and HeLa cell lines, where complexes were observed as potent towards the HeLa cell line only. The potent TiC2 and TiC8 were screened with MTT assay against a normal HEK-293 cell line and were found to be inactive as expected.

Zhang H.; Shi H.,Construction of a prediction model for coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study,2025,Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-025-85692-x,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as a globally prevalent metabolic disorder, is continuously rising in prevalence and significantly increases the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). Studies have shown that the risk of CHD is higher in T2DM patients compared to those without diabetes, making early identification and prevention essential. Therefore, establishing an effective prediction model to identify high-risk individuals for CHD among T2DM patients is crucial. This study aims to develop and validate a prediction model for coronary heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, accurately identifying high-risk individuals to support early intervention and personalized treatment. The study included 423 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were hospitalized in the endocrinology department of a tertiary hospital in Anhui Province between February 1, 2023, and February 1, 2024. Based on the presence of hypertension, patients were divided into a T2DM with coronary heart disease (CHD) group (193 patients) and a T2DM group (230 patients). Data were collected through questionnaires and clinical indicators. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify significant predictors, and the model was validated. Model performance was evaluated using the ROC curve and AUC value. Hypertension, smoking, neuropathy, vascular complications, cerebral infarction, bilateral lower extremity arteriosclerosis, microalbuminuria, and elevated uric acid levels. were identified as significant predictors for T2DM with hypertension. The AUC of the prediction model was 0.83, indicating good predictive performance. The prediction model developed in this study effectively identifies high-risk patients with T2DM and CHD, providing a reliable tool for clinical use. This model facilitates early intervention and personalized treatment for hypertension, smoking, neuropathy, vascular complications, cerebral infarction, bilateral lower extremity arteriosclerosis, microalbuminuria, and elevated uric acid levels, improving overall health outcomes for patient. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218913474,Cross-sectional study

Prescription of anticoagulants is key to manage it; however, CKD patients have shown an increased risk of bleeding under anticoagulation therapy compared to non-CKD patients. We hypothesized that the sex could modify the metabolism of indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin and Apixaban. Our intoxication model shows that higher doses of IS and apixaban accumulate in the plasma of female mice because of expression differences in efflux transporters and cytochromes in the liver, ileum and kidneys, when compared to males. Furthermore, we found that accumulation of apixaban in females contributes to increased bleeding. Transcriptional analysis of liver samples revealed elevated Sult1a1 but reduced Abcg2 and Cyp3a11 in female mice, while in the kidneys the expression rates of Oat1 and Oat3 were respectively lower and higher than those observed in males, potentially affecting drug clearance. Whole proteomics liver analysis confirmed the previous transcriptional results at the protein level and revealed that sex had a major influence in regulating both coagulation and drug metabolism pathways. Thus, our findings underline the need for inclusive clinical and preclinical trials to accurately reflect sex-specific metabolic variations, and to consider CKD-specific changes to optimize dosing, minimize side effects, and improve patient outcomes. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219126827,Apixaban

Therefore, it is important to investigate compounds that can be potential candidates to mitigate these effects, such as baicalin.

Our results suggest that DON reduced cellular metabolic activity but did not prove to be cytotoxic, and baicalin was able to attenuate this adverse effect. The change in extracellular LDH activity suggests that after 48 h the cells have already started to respond to the adverse effects of the toxin and protective mechanisms were induced. Based on the measured oxidative parameters, baicalin showed antioxidant activity, but after longer exposure, our results indicate a prooxidant effect. Baicalin also had an anti-inflammatory effect based on the amount of IL-6 and IL-8, while DON exerted a dose-and time-dependent pleiotropic activity. These results suggest that DON may have an impact on cellular inflammation and oxidative homeostasis, and that baicalin could be able to alleviate these adverse effects. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001636957,Baicalin; Viability assay

Although there is concern about their adverse effects on ecosystem services and their potential effects on human health, their xenobiotic kinetics and dynamics in humans are not understood well. In this study, we determined a xenobiotic kinetic parameter, plasma protein bindings (PPBs) of 7 neonicotinoids and 18 metabolites with human plasma using a Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis (RED) device and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), and compared their PPBs with their physicochemical properties. 6-chloronicotinic acid (6-CNA) exhibited the highest PPB (86.4%), followed by imidacloprid-olefin (86.3%) in human plasma. Their PPBs are much higher than that of the parent compound, imidacloprid (27.5%). The PPBs of neonicotinoids and metabolites are not related to their lipophilicity determined by reversed-phase LC.

Here we assessed the impact of obesity on echocardiographic findings, infarct size, circulating biomarkers, mitochondrial respiratory capacity and mortality in a closed-chest minipig model of MI. The initial study population consisted of 20 obese (median 60.0 kg [interquartile range 55.9–64.6 kg]) and 18 lean (25.0 kg [23.4–36.5 kg]) female Göttingen minipigs. The duration of obesity induction using a western-style diet was up to approximately 6 months (156 days [24–162 days]) before the induction of MI. The induction of MI by 120-min balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was feasible in 17 lean and 17 obese animals. Mortality was higher in obese compared with lean animals (53% versus 12%), driven primarily by refractory ventricular fibrillation during occlusion. Electrocardiographic findings showed longer QRS and QT intervals and more extensive ST-segment elevation in obese animals compared with lean animals during occlusion. Plasma concentrations of pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, pro-C-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin T were significantly lower in obese compared with lean animals. Infarct size estimated 8 weeks after MI was significantly smaller in obese (10% [9–11%]) compared with lean animals (13% [13–15%]). Finally, mitochondrial-complex-I-linked respiratory capacity was overall significantly higher in obese animals; however, no group difference was found in intrinsic mitochondrial respiratory capacity. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001594330,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, no IGF-1R targeting agent has shown substantial clinical benefit in controlled phase 3 trials, and no biomarker has been shown to have clinical utility in the prediction of benefit from an IGF-1R targeting agent. IGFBP7 is an atypical insulin-like growth factor binding protein as it has a higher affinity for the IGF-1R than IGF ligands. We report that low IGFBP7 gene expression identifies a subset of breast cancers for which the addition of ganitumab, an anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, substantially improved the pathological complete response rate compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. The pCR rate in the chemotherapy plus ganitumab arm was 46.9% in patients in the lowest quartile of IGFBP7 expression, in contrast to only 5.6% in the highest quartile. Furthermore, high IGFBP7 expression predicted increased distant metastasis risk. If our findings are confirmed, decisions to halt the development of IGF-1R targeting drugs, which were based on disappointing results of prior trials that did not use predictive biomarkers, should be reviewed. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205962546,Neoadjuvant Therapy

For 14 days, 36 Hispanic/Latino adults (28 female, 14 with non-insulin treated T2D) wore a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and a physical activity monitor (Actigraph) while simultaneously logging meals using the MyFitnessPal app. We model meal events and daily digital biomarkers representing diet, physical activity choices, and corresponding glycemic response. We develop a digital biomarker for meal events that differentiates meal events into normal and elevated categories. We examine the contribution of daily digital biomarkers of elevated meal event count and step count on daily time-in-range 54-140 mg/dL (TIR54–140) and average glucose. After adjusting for step count, a change in elevated meal event count from zero to two decreases TIR54–140 by 4.0% (p = 0.003). An increase in 1000 steps in post-meal step count also reduces the meal event glucose response by 641 min mg/dL (p = 0.0006) and reduces the odds of an elevated meal event by 55% (p < 0.0001).

Natively occurring inhibitors of hIAPP aggregation might therefore provide a model for drug design against amyloid formation associated with T2D. Here, we describe the combined ability of low pH, zinc, and insulin to inhibit hIAPP fibrillation. Insulin dose-dependently slows hIAPP aggregation near neutral pH but had less effect on the aggregation kinetics at acidic pH. We determine that insulin alters hIAPP aggregation in two manners. First, insulin diverts the aggregation pathway to large nonfibrillar aggregates with ThT-positive molecular structure, rather than to amyloid fibrils. Second, soluble insulin suppresses hIAPP dimer formation, which is an important early aggregation event. Further, we observe that zinc significantly modulates the inhibition of hIAPP aggregation by insulin. We hypothesize that this effect arose from controlling the oligomeric state of insulin and show that hIAPP interacts more strongly with monomeric than oligomeric insulin. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197137514,Amyloid (mycology); Oligomer

It plays vital roles in de novo synthesis of saturated fatty acids and regulates insulin sensitivity. We previously demonstrated that serum circulating FAS (cFAS) is a clinical biomarker for advanced atherosclerosis, and that it is conjugated to low-density lipoproteins (LDL). However, it remains unknown whether cFAS can directly impact atheroprogression. To investigate this, we evaluate whether cFAS impacts macrophage foam cell formation – an important cellular process leading to atheroprogression. Macrophages exposed to human serum containing high levels of cFAS show increased foam cell formation as compared to cells exposed to serum containing low levels of cFAS. This difference is not observed using serum containing either high or low LDL. Pharmacological inhibition of cFAS using Platensimycin (PTM) decreases foam cell formation in vitro. In Apoe−/− mice with normal FAS expression, administration of PTM over 16 weeks along with a high fat diet decreases cFAS activity and aortic atherosclerosis without affecting circulating total cholesterol. This effect is also observed in Apoe−/− mice with liver-specific knockout of hepatic Fasn. Reductions in aortic root plaque are associated with decreased macrophage infiltration. These findings demonstrate that cFAS plays an important role in arterial atheroprogression. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219130317,Apolipoprotein E; Foam cell

This study aims to explore the role of TLR4 in regulating macrophage immunity and metabolism in greater depth. It also seeks to reveal how changes in these processes affect the interaction between macrophages and both pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Using TLR4 knockout mice and the combined approaches of single-cell RNA sequencing and experimental validation, we demonstrate that in sepsis, TLR4-deficient macrophages upregulate Abca1, enhance cholesterol efflux, and reduce glycolysis, promoting M2 polarization and attenuating inflammation. These metabolic and phenotypic shifts significantly affect their interactions with pulmonary ECs and LECs. Mechanistically, we uncovered that TLR4 operates through multiple pathways in endothelial dysfunction: macrophage TLR4 mediates inflammatory damage to ECs/LECs, while endothelial TLR4 both directly sensitizes cells to lipopolysaccharide-induced injury and determines their susceptibility to macrophage-derived inflammatory signals. These findings reveal the complex role of TLR4 in orchestrating both immune-mediated and direct endothelial responses during sepsis-induced ALI, supporting that targeting TLR4 on multiple cell populations may present an effective therapeutic strategy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000524801,Lymphatic Endothelium

Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) functions as a central signal transduction hub in apicomplexan parasites. However, PKG has not been characterized in N. caninum, and its targets and pathways controlled by PKG remain unknown. Using a mini auxin-inducible degron system (mAID), we knocked down PKG in N. caninum, demonstrating its indispensable role in tachyzoite invasion and egress from host cells. PKG promotes microneme secretion and enhances tachyzoite gliding motility by elevating intracellular Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i). Phosphoproteomics identified 1125 proteins as potential downstream targets of PKG, showing significantly reduced phosphorylation after treatment with the PKG inhibitor MBP146-78. These proteins are involved in signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, lipid transport and metabolism, vesicle transport, and ion transport. Additionally, CACNAP, a calcium channel-associated protein that facilitates calcium influx at the plasma membrane, plays a supportive role in the egress process of N. caninum. These findings underscore the importance of PKG and its downstream molecules in regulating egress, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the activation of [Ca2+]i. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004932758,Microneme; Phosphoproteomics; Transport protein; cGMP-dependent protein kinase

However, its C-terminal end can be cleaved by carboxypeptidase A, and removal of the last leucine residue (L585) weakens receptor binding, reducing its half-life from 20 days to 3.5 days in humans. This biology has so far been overlooked when designing human albumin-fused biologics. Thus, there is a need for an engineering strategy to secure favorable FcRn binding and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we show that a branched aliphatic amino acid or methionine at position 585 of albumin is required for optimal receptor binding, which cannot be replaced to prevent enzymatic cleavage without negatively affecting FcRn engagement. As a solution, we report that C-terminally cleaved albumin can be efficiently rescued from intracellular degradation by introducing amino acid substitutions that improve FcRn binding. This albumin-engineering strategy was also effective when applied with a therapeutic fusion partner, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), resulting in a 2-fold increase in plasma half-life and prolonged efficacy in human FcRn transgenic mice. We demonstrate how human albumin fusions should be tailored to ensure a long plasma half-life and enhanced efficacy of fused biologics, despite potential C-terminal cleavage in vivo.

Furthermore, IgGs possess unusually long half-lives in the blood (2-3 weeks). IgGs achieve such extraordinary half-lives through a pH-dependent interaction with the FcRn-receptor whereby IgGs are recycled. No high-resolution structure of FcRn in complex with a full-length IgG is available, and the interaction was long thought to be mediated solely via the IgG-Fc. However, some IgGs with identical Fc-parts, but different Fab-domains, exhibit different half-lives, suggesting involvement of the Fab-domains in FcRn binding. Here, we employ structural mass spectrometry (HDX-MS and XL-MS) to explore the interaction of full-length IgGs with FcRn. HDX-MS and XL-MS experiments confirm an interaction between FcRn and the Fc-region of IgGs, through three cross-links between FcRn and the IgG-Fc-domain and a reduction in HDX in both the receptor and the Fc-region upon complex formation. However, FcRn-induced changes in HDX are also observed in the Fab-domains, supported by cross-links between the Fab-domains and the α3-domain of FcRn. Our results thus provide direct evidence for an IgG Fab-FcRn interaction. We envision that these results could advance the engineering of IgG-antibodies with tailored pharmacokinetics and enhanced efficacy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007865320,Identification; Neonatal Fc receptor

However, the specific biophysical features influencing their effectiveness are poorly understood. We investigated the design principles defining the target-binding moiety of bioPROTACs. We used our recently developed assay for accurately measuring degradation rates, based on microinjection and live-cell microscopy, independent of other confounding factors like biosynthesis and transport. We used a very efficient UPS interaction domain from CHIP E3 ligase, and 9 different well-characterized DARPins to test degradation of the proof-of-principle target eGFP. All but two DARPins work well in this context, one sterically preventing E2 binding in the complex, the other overlapping with the target ubiquitination epitope. Affinity and thermodynamic stability of the binders had only a modest role. BioPROTACs constructed in this way were able to degrade eGFP catalytically. DARPins by themselves could also accelerate degradation of bound GFP, using other cellular E3 systems, but in a non-catalytic manner. The most important factor for efficient degradation by a bioPROTAC in trans is the correct orientation of the complex for target ubiquitination and presentation to the proteasome, still to be determined empirically. The strategies developed here show an efficient pathway to characterize and optimize such systems. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008534274,Protein Degradation

Animal studies suggested that the pathway linking these events can be mediated by mobile zinc secreted into the intraretinal space and exerting cytotoxic effects. Whether this mechanism is relevant for human glaucoma and what are the targets of extracellular zinc is unknown. We report that increased zinc content in the aqueous humor and retina is indeed a characteristic of glaucomatous neuropathy, and excess extracellular zinc may be recognized by the key retinal neurotrophic factor PEDF. Biophysical and X-ray crystallographic studies show that PEDF coordinates zinc ions in five types of intermolecular high-affinity sites, leading to a decrease in negative surface charge and reversible oligomerization of the protein, thereby masking the target recognition sites responsible for its neurotrophic and antiangiogenic activities and collagen binding. Notably, PEDF secretion is enhanced in both glaucoma and retinal cell models in response to zinc stress; however, zinc binding negatively affects axogenic, differentiative and prosurvival functions of PEDF by suppressing its ability to activate receptor PEDF-R/PNPLA2. We suggest that glaucomatous neurodegeneration is associated with direct inhibition of PEDF signaling by extracellular zinc, making their complex a promising target for neuroprotective therapy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010144975,PEDF

Despite knowledge of the role of SOD1 aggregation, the mechanistic understanding remains elusive. Our investigation aimed to unravel the complex steps involved in SOD1 aggregation associated with ALS. Therefore, we probed the aggregation using ThT fluorescence, size-exclusion chromatography, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The removal of metal ions and disulfide bonds resulted in the dimers rapidly first converting to an extended monomers then coming together slowly to form non-native dimers. The rapid onset of oligomerization happens above critical non-native dimer concentration. Structural features of oligomer was obtained through SERS. The kinetic data supported a fragmentation-dominant mechanism for the fibril formation. Quercetin acts as inhibitor by delaying the formation of non-native dimer and soluble oligomers by decreasing the elongation rate.

Therefore, insights into molecular mechanisms that regulate insulin homeostasis might provide entry sites to replenish insulin content and restore β cell function. Here, we identify the insulin inhibitory receptor (inceptor; encoded by the gene IIR/ELAPOR1) as an insulin-binding receptor that regulates insulin stores by lysosomal degradation. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (SC)-derived islets, we show that IIR knockout (KO) results in enhanced SC β cell differentiation and survival. Strikingly, extended in vitro culture of IIR KO SC β cells leads to greatly increased insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). We find that inceptor localizes to clathrin-coated vesicles close to the plasma membrane and in the trans-Golgi network as well as in secretory granules, where it acts as a sorting receptor to direct proinsulin and insulin towards lysosomal degradation. Targeting inceptor using a monoclonal antibody increases proinsulin and insulin content and improves SC β cell GSIS.

Cyanide production is stimulated by glycine, occurs at the low pH of lysosomes and requires peroxidase activity. When generated at a specific rate, cyanide exerts stimulatory effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics, cell metabolism and cell proliferation, but impairs cellular bioenergetics at high concentrations. Cyanide can modify cysteine residues via protein S-cyanylation, which is detectable basally in cells and mice, and increases in response to glycine. Low-dose cyanide supplementation exhibits cytoprotective effects in hypoxia and reoxygenation models in vitro and in vivo.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) utilizing terminal mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-carrying N-glycans attached to therapeutic enzymes produced by mammalian cell lines has been clinically applied to several LSDs. Recent studies suggested an unidentified delivery pathway mediated by sialic acid-containing N-glycans. However, more economical platform development is required to produce large quantities of recombinant enzymes. Transgenic silkworms have been established as low-cost systems for expressing recombinant glycoproteins. Microbial endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases (ENGases) enable the transglycosylation of N-glycans to other types. Methods: We purified recombinant human IDUA from IDUA transgenic silkworm cocoons and performed ENGase-mediated transglycosylation. Furthermore, we performed intravenous enzyme replacement therapy in a Japanese macaque MPS I non-human primate model carrying a homozygous IDUA missense mutation. Results: Here we show the establishment of IDUA transgenic silkworms and purification of recombinant human IDUA from cocoons. As M6P- and sialic acid-containing N-glycans are not attached to purified hIDUA, we perform ENGase-mediated transglycosylation to obtain hIDUAs with M6P- and sialic acid-containing N-glycans (neoglyco-hIDUAs). Furthermore, we perform intravenous neoglyco-hIDUA replacement therapy in MPS I non-human primate model and succeed in improving the clinical signs and reducing the urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels. Conclusions: These glycotechnologies using transgenic silkworms and ENGases are expected to serve as platforms for developing therapeutic glycoproteins. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003290418,Lysosomal storage disease; Mucopolysaccharidosis type I; Recombineering

To address this gap, we conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health records from COVID-19 patients over 2.5 years of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify associated clinical features. Methods: We analyze a retrospective cohort of 21,312 acute-care patients over a 2.5 year period and define six clinical trajectory groups (TGs) associated with demographics, diagnoses, vitals, labs, imaging, consultations, and medications. Results: We show that the proportion of mild patients increased over time, particularly during Omicron waves. Additionally, while mild and fatal patients had differences in age, age did not distinguish patients with severe versus critical disease. Furthermore, we find that both male sex and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity are associated with more severe/critical TGs. More severe patients also have a higher rate of neuropsychiatric diagnoses and consultations, along with an immunological signature of high neutrophils and immature granulocytes, and low lymphocytes and monocytes. Interestingly, low albumin is one of the best lab predictors of COVID-19 severity in association with higher malnutrition in severe/critical patients, raising concern of nutritional insufficiency influencing COVID-19 outcomes. Despite this, only a small fraction of severe/critical patients had nutritional labs checked (e.g. Vitamin D, thiamine, B vitamins) or received vitamin supplementation. Conclusions: Our findings expand on clinical risk factors in COVID-19, and highlight the interaction between severity, nutritional status, and neuropsychiatric complications in acute care patients to enable identification of patients at risk for severe disease. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003753847,2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Acute care

However, intrinsic factors that counteract vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis remain scarce. Here we identify insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) as a homeostasis-associated molecule that restrains endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis. IGFBP6 levels are significantly reduced in human atherosclerotic arteries and patient serum. Reduction of IGFBP6 in human endothelial cells by siRNA increases inflammatory molecule expression and monocyte adhesion. Conversely, pro-inflammatory effects mediated by disturbed flow (DF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are reversed by IGFBP6 overexpression. Mechanistic investigations further reveal that IGFBP6 executes anti-inflammatory effects directly through the major vault protein (MVP)–c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling axis. Finally, IGFBP6-deficient mice show aggravated diet- and DF-induced atherosclerosis, whereas endothelial-cell-specific IGFBP6-overexpressing mice protect against atherosclerosis. Based on these findings, we propose that reduction of endothelial IGFBP6 is a predisposing factor in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, which can be therapeutically targeted. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217157616,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Separation or a compromise temperature to the detriment of food safety or taste preference are the options. In the present article, we find that it is possible to cook albumen and yolk at two temperatures without separation by using periodic boundary conditions in the energy transport problem. Through mathematical modeling and subsequent simulation, we are able to design the novel cooking method, namely periodic cooking. Comparison with established egg cooking procedures through a plethora of characterization techniques, including Sensory Analysis, Texture Profile Analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy, confirms the different cooking extents and the different variations in protein denaturation with the novel approach. The method not only optimizes egg texture and nutrients, but also holds promise for innovative culinary applications and materials treatment. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218249013,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Recently, dysregulation of insulin signaling (IS) and aberrations in mitochondrial function have emerged as robust, evolutionarily conserved components of FXS pathophysiology. However, the mechanisms by which altered IS and mitochondrial dysfunction impact behavior in the context of FXS remain elusive. Here, we show that normalization of IS improves mitochondrial volume and function in flies that lack expression of dfmr1, the Drosophila homolog of the causal gene of FXS in humans. Further, we demonstrate that dysregulation of IS underlies diminished expression of the mitochondrial master regulator PGC-1α/Spargel in dfmr1 mutant flies. These results are behaviorally relevant, as we show that pan-neuronal augmentation of PGC-1α/Spargel improves circadian behavior in dfmr1 mutants. Notably, we also show that modulation of PGC-1α/Spargel expression in wild-type flies phenocopies the dfmr1 mutant circadian defect. Taken together, the results presented herein provide a mechanistic link between mitochondrial function and circadian behavior both in FXS pathogenesis as well as more broadly at the interface between metabolism and behavioral output. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010895807,Fragile X Syndrome; Phenocopy
Atsar F.S.; Bourger H.D.; Baker C.A.,Online integration of capillary electrophoresis and dual detector Taylor dispersion analysis via a 3D printed instrument,2025,Analyst ,10.1039/d4an01208a,"Hydrodynamic radius (RH) is a descriptive metric of protein structure with the potential to impact drug development, disease diagnosis, and other important research areas of molecular biology. Common instrumental methods for molecular size characterization are disadvantageous due to high sample consumption, measurements made in non-physiological conditions, and/or inaccurate size determinations. Capillary Taylor dispersion analysis (TDA) is a molecular sizing method that utilizes nL sample volumes and achieves absolute size determination without calibration or comparison to standards. One key drawback of TDA is that it reports the concentration-weighted average RH, which may be limiting in the analysis of complex sample mixtures. Here, we describe the development of a 3D printed instrument to integrate capillary electrophoresis (CE) separations online with TDA size characterization. Dual laser-induced fluorescence detectors were developed to enable two-channel detection using a single PMT and fluorescence filter set, achieving detection limits for AlexaFluor 532 of 0.6 ± 0.4 nM and 1.1 ± 0.2 nM for detectors 1 and 2, respectively. Joule heating during CE separations was observed to introduce bias in subsequent TDA measurements. The effects of Joule heating were mitigated by integrating a water circulating sheath flow on the portion of the capillary used for CE. The utility of CE-TDA in bioanalysis was demonstrated by standard-free peak identification in the ficin digestion of IgG1. CE-TDA was further applied to characterizing denaturation dynamics of the Group II heat resistant protein apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA), in which RH was observed to increase from 2.3 ± 0.2 nm at 20 °C to 5.2 ± 0.5 nm while heated at at 90 °C, then returned to a quasi-native state with RH = 2.9 ± 0.5 nm after cooling to 20 °C. CE-TDA is a powerful analysis mode with potential to impact various domains of bioanalysis. The instrument developed in this work offers a low barrier to entry for researchers interested in adopting CE-TDA. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215839650,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Notably, HMPC exhibited a red-shifted, two-fold fluorescence “turn-on” enhancement in response to Zn2+ at 490 nm, with a detection limit of 1.68 μM, which is significantly lower than the WHO guideline (76.0 μM). The binding constant of HMPC with Zn2+ was calculated to be 5 × 104 M−1. The fluorescence enhancement of HMPC in the presence of Zn2+ is attributed to the suppression of the PET process and the enhancement of ICT, leading to fluorescence via the CHEF mechanism. The sensing mechanism was demonstrated through UV-vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, Job plots, ESI-MS, and DFT calculations. For biological applications, cytotoxicity and cell imaging studies were performed using MCF-7 cells. Molecular docking studies revealed a high binding energy of HMPC (ΔG = −7.1 kcal mol−1) with the 4,5-diaryl isoxazole HSP90 chaperone protein, suggesting its potential as an anticancer agent. Additionally, its binding energy of −6.5 kcal mol−1 with the HDAC8 protein indicates greater efficacy than suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in inhibiting HDAC, as it binds more strongly to the HDAC8 protein than SAHA (−7.4 kcal mol−1). Furthermore, due to its favorable ADME profile, HMPC may be suitable for oral administration, enhancing its potential as an anticancer drug. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218110465,Aqueous medium; Carbohydrazide; Conjugate; Docking (animal); Pyrazole

By tuning the chemical, mechanical, and erosion properties of injected hydrogel depots, additional control over cell compatibility and pharmaceutical release kinetics may be realized. Here, we employ thiol-ene click chemistry to prepare a library of modified hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) derivatives for subsequent use in PNP hydrogel applications. When combined with poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles, we demonstrate that systematically altering the hydrophobic, steric, or pi stacking character of HPMC modifications can readily tailor the mechanical properties of PNP hydrogels. Additionally, we highlight the compatibility of the synthetic platform for the incorporation of cysteine-bearing peptides to access PNP hydrogels with improved bioactivity. Finally, through leveraging the tunable physical properties afforded by this method, we show hydrogel retention time in vivo can be dramatically altered without sacrificing mesh size or cargo diffusion rates.

In this study, we prepared a reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pH dual-sensitive nanogel for the co-encapsulation of doxorubicin (DOX) and indocyanine green (ICG)-conjugated bovine serum albumin (BSA) via a simple inverse miniemulsion polymerization process. This was followed by modification with pegylated cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) containing citraconic anhydride (CDM) linkers, which are sensitive to weakly acidic microenvironments (pH 6.5). Pegylation endowed the nanogel with extended blood circulation, while the de-shielding of polyethylene glycol (PEG) exposed the CPPs, significantly enhancing cellular uptake. Upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, ROS generated by ICG not only killed tumor cells but also triggered the release of DOX through nanogel disintegration. Serial experiments verified the nanogel's high co-delivery efficiency, tumor tissue matrix microenvironment-triggered cellular uptake, controlled drug release, and synergistic antitumor effects. Therefore, this dual-sensitive nanogel, prepared via inverse miniemulsion polymerization, offers a facile approach to improving co-delivery efficiency for combination therapy. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219722306,Dual role; Nanogel

However, the existence of antibodies that specifically recognize PEG and their adverse effects on in vivo behaviors have been increasingly reported, highlighting the necessity of alternative modification strategies for aptamers. To address this issue, we focused on a zwitterionic polymer, particularly poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC), as a PEG alternative to modify DNA aptamers. We conjugated PMPC to a DNA aptamer targeting IFN-gamma and investigated the properties of the PMPC-conjugated DNA aptamer as a therapeutic agent. PMPC modification did not affect the neutralizing activity of the aptamer. PMPC demonstrated lower reactivity against anti-PEG antibodies than PEG-like aptamer modifiers previously reported to exhibit low reactivity against PEG antibodies. In addition, PMPC extended the blood circulation time of the aptamer as long as or longer than PEG with a similar molecular size. In the LPS-induced inflammation animal model, the survival rate after treatment with the PMPC-aptamer conjugate was significantly superior to that with unmodified aptamer. These results indicate that PMPC has potential as an aptamer or other nucleic acid drug modifier to replace or be compatible with PEG. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217093751,Aptamer; Reactivity

Our goal was to identify the effector molecule whose binding alters the protein-DNA affinity, thereby enabling gene transcription. The designed DNA probes exhibited distinctive responses to the binding and release of the protein, characterized by significant alterations in fluorescence lifetime. Through this method, we have identified l-lactate as the sole metabolite exerting a substantial modulating effect on the protein-DNA interaction and thus confirmed its role as an effector molecule.

Cells optimize their function within tissue microenvironments by expressing specific subsets of RNAs.

We investigate phenyl azide and diazirine crosslinking scaffolds and define their photoactivity profiles. We then deploy the aryl azide scaffold with three fluorophores for multiplexing on glyoxal fixed cells and analyze the defined populations using flow cytometry. Finally, we apply CrossSeq to investigate an in vitro MDA-MB-231-LM2 metastatic cancer migration model to evaluate changes in gene expression at the migratory cell front versus the exterior population.

In this study, we investigated the effect of urban PM on the secondary structure of proteins using bovine serum albumin (BSA). An urban aerosol (CRM28) was used as the original PM (PMO) and washed with acetone to investigate the effect of PM with two different chemical compositions. After washing with acetone, the remaining PM fraction contained decreased amounts of ions and carbon, while the metallic concentration was increased; thus, this PM fraction was labeled as PMM. After incubation of BSA with PM, the samples were subjected to Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to investigate the changes in the absorption peak of the amide I band. BSA incubated with PMO and PMM showed an increase in the β-sheet ratio to the total secondary structure. Furthermore, the β-sheet content was more significantly increased when mixed with PMM (by 22.6%), indicating a more significant effect of the metallic fraction on the formation of β-sheets. In comparison, the lowest total amount of α-helix and β-sheets (with a decrease of 8.5%) was observed after incubation with PMO, associated with the protein partial unfolding in the presence of ions and carbonaceous PM constituents.

In our recent investigations on microplastics in environmental waters, we noted abundant blue microfibers and fragments, whose identification was achieved via Raman spectroscopy. Still widely used in the plastics industry, despite awareness raised at a global level, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), a blue pigment carried by abundantly used blue plastics, like a “Trojan horse”, is a secondary threat (after plastics) in the trophic chain, being highly resistant to a broad range of conditions. Here, the newly discovered resonance Raman (RR) signal of the blue pigment CuPc embedded in environmentally aged plastics allowed us to lower the minimum size of detectable nanoplastics via micro-Raman spectroscopy down to 500 nm. In addition, we demonstrated nanoplastics detection solely via the CuPc RR signal, a result subsequently validated using SEM-EDX. Based on a visible-NIR Raman spectroscopy investigation of isolated synthetic CuPc compounds, we discussed the observed changes in pigment spectra in blue plastic waste aged for an estimated 20 years, consisting of highly brittle ropes knotted in fishing nets and harvested via scuba diving from the seabed. Thus, the fate of CuPc in environmentally aged blue plastics could provide robust analytical opportunities when studying the impact of aged, blue-coloured plastics at various levels, due to its persistent, selective and specific RR signal. The results are crucial for expanding the capability of Raman tools for further tracking the micro-to-nanoplastic degradation of waste along the trophic chain, improving our understanding of its impact on living organisms. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002687326,Trojan horse
Ibrahim B.; Akere T.H.; Dhumal P.; Valsami-Jones E.; Chakraborty S.,Designing safer nanohybrids: stability and ecotoxicological assessment of graphene oxide-gold nanoparticle hybrids in embryonic zebrafish,2025,Environmental Science: Nano,10.1039/d4en01173b,"Graphene oxide (GO) and graphene oxide-gold (GO-Au) nanohybrids offer promising applications in nanomedicine, biosensing, and environmental technology due to their unique properties. However, concerns regarding their environmental and biological safety remain largely unexplored. This study, using a safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) approach, evaluates the cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and dispersion stability of GO and GO-Au nanohybrids in zebrafish ZF4 cells. GO was synthesised using a modified Hummer's method and GO-Au nanohybrids were prepared by incorporating gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into the GO matrix. Physicochemical characterisation revealed enhanced dispersion stability of GO-Au nanohybrids, retaining over 98% of their initial absorbance in ultrapure water (UPW) and over 95% in DMEM/F12 after 48 hours. In contrast, GO displayed higher levels of sedimentation. Toxicity assessments indicated a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability. After 72 hours, ZF4 cell viability was reduced to 39.5% for 150 μg mL−1 GO, whereas GO-Au treatment at the same concentration exhibited a less severe reduction (54.5% viability). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was significantly higher in GO-treated cells compared to GO-Au, with GO generating approximately 2x more ROS at concentrations of 50 μg mL−1 and 100 μg mL−1. Apoptosis and necrosis rates were also significantly elevated in GO-treated cells, with necrosis reaching 53.1% at 100 μg mL−1, compared to 14.6% in GO-Au-treated cells. These findings demonstrate that the incorporation of AuNPs reduces cytotoxicity and oxidative stress by enhancing the colloidal stability of GO-Au nanohybrids. This study provides critical baseline data on the interaction of GO-based nanomaterials (NMs) with biological systems and highlights the importance of NM modification for safer, more sustainable applications. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000751213,SAFER

MR leads to the formation of a number of chemically different structures called Maillard reaction products (MRPs), which include early glycation products and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs/MRPs were shown to modulate the immune response by interaction with specific receptors expressed on immune cells, such as the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). However, the structure-function relationship of MRPs formed during soy processing in relation to binding to AGE receptors has not been well studied. The aim of the present study is to characterize the MRPs formed during different heating times of soy proteins (SP) with glucose by analyzing the biochemical changes and to relate them to the functional changes, including binding to AGE receptors and stimulating immune cells. Our results demonstrated time-dependent differences in the biochemical characteristics of glycated SP compared with heated SP, which could be attributed to the different stages of MR and the diversity of MRPs. Moreover, the formation of AGEs over time was positively correlated with binding capacity to AGE receptors. Additionally, stimulating peripheral blood adherent monocytes with glycated SP resulted in increased gene expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8 and TNF-α) when compared to non-glycated SP, suggesting that the formed AGEs bind to and activate receptors, such as RAGE. Our findings highlight the importance of studying immunomodulation upon processing of SP, which may lead to optimisation of the processing conditions of soy based food products. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001092519,RAGE

This study aims to explore the role of GEN in alleviating RA by regulating exosome secretion and the inflammatory microenvironment through the Rab27/nSMase2/Mfge8 pathway in collageninduced arthritis (CIA) mice and in vitro. In vivo studies revealed that GEN treatment significantly reduced paw swelling in CIA mice and protected the integrity of knee and ankle joints in CIA mice. GEN supplementation caused a significant decrease in the levels of MMP-9 and pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. GEN also significantly diminished the expressions of β-catenin and exosomal Dvl3 and miR-221-3p in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Molecular docking results showed that GEN had strong binding energy with Rab27a, nSMase2 and Mfge8, the key regulators of exosome secretion, respectively, which was confirmed by CETSA and DARTS detection. In vitro mechanism analysis demonstrated that GEN treatment simultaneously downregulated the expression of Rab27a, nSMase2 and Mfge8, and phenotypic analysis verified that GEN prevented the secretion of Alix+Hsp70+CD63+ exosomes induced by type II collagen (CII) from FLS. Further analysis showed that GEN inhibited the expression of the Wnt signaling pathway protein β-catenin and exosomal Dvl3 in FLS. Additionally, GEN inhibited CII-induced secretion of MMP-9 and TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in FLS, and GEN also significantly inhibited CII-induced FLS migration. Notably, GEN inhibited the expression of miR-221-3p in FLS exosomes and enhanced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in vitro. Collectively, this study clarified that GEN alleviates RA by inhibiting the secretion of FLS exosomes regulated by the Rab27/nSMase2/Mfge8 pathway and by inhibiting Dvl3/β-catenin and miR-221-3p.  © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216853216,Exosome

Devices to enable routine and cost effective measurement of their activity could find frequent use in clinical settings for medical diagnostics, as well as some industrial contexts such as detecting on-line biological contamination. In particular, devices that make use of readouts involving magnetic particles may offer distinct advantages for continuous sensing because material they release can be magnetically captured downstream and their readout is insensitive to optical properties of the sample. Bioassays based on giant magnetoresistance sensors that detect the binding or release of magnetic materials have been widely explored for these reasons, but they typically require expensive consumables. Here, we develop a simpler protease sensor based on inductive detection of particle release with pulsed magnetic fields, leveraging a design that incorporates both the pulse coil and gradiometer coils into a printed circuit board. Our fluidic chips are formed from casts of 3D printed molds, such that both the sensor and the consumable components could be relatively easy to mass produce. Using pulses ranging up to 10 s of mT, we show that our device has a limit of detection below 1 μg of iron and that its duty cycle can be varied to control temperature through Joule heating. By chemically functionalizing the glass surface of our fluidic chips with zwitterionic polymer and incorporating a PEG block co-polymer into the PDMS component, we are able to suppress the nonspecific binding of albumin by 7.8 times inside the chips. We demonstrate a layer-by-layer approach for covalently linking magnetic nanoparticles to the chips via cleavable peptide substrates. Finally, we observe the release of the magnetic particles from the chips under conditions of proteolytic cleavage and measure resulting changes in inductive signals, demonstrating a detection sensitivity for chymotrypsin in the hundreds of nM. The methods we establish here have the potential to aid progress toward sensors comprised of disposable fluidic chips measured by inexpensive detection devices that may one day facilitate ubiquitous protease activity monitoring. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214704793,Fluidics; Line (geometry)

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the main treatment for Pompe disease. However, its effectivity is reduced by the immune response, enzyme proteolysis, and the enzyme difficulty in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This work aimed to design and synthesize enzymatic nanoreactors based on the enzyme confinement inside virus-like particles to improve the ERT for Pompe disease. The GAA confinement was performed by self-assembling the coat proteins of the brome mosaic virus in the presence of GAA. Then, nanoreactors were surface functionalized with a 6-phosphate mannose derivative using modified polyethylene glycol (PEG) to improve their capacity to cross the brain-blood barrier (BBB). The functionalized enzymatic nanoreactors showed a 1.6 times faster crossing rate than the unfunctionalized nanoreactors in an in vitro model of the BBB. In conclusion, enzymatic nanoreactors with GAA activity were successfully synthesized and functionalized with a 6-phosphate mannose derivative to improve the enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and reduce the immunogenic response for Pompe disease treatment. The advantages of using virus-like particles as enzyme nanocarriers for treating Pompe disease are discussed. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216627802,Alpha (finance); Alpha-glucosidase; Nanoreactor

With parallel line of thought, herein, we have reported the synthesis and characterisation of dual drug stearic acidloaded solid lipid nanoparticles and screened their efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer. The desired nanoparticles, namely 9-CH2OH Nos-Tel-SLNs, were prepared using the solvent diffusion method. TEM and AFM images revealed that the nanoparticles have spherical form with a mean size of 36.6 nm. The nanostructures' zeta potential and hydrodynamic size were found to be -36.23 mV and ∼406.8 nm, respectively. From RP-HPLC, the noscapine and telmisartan loaded in the nanoparticles were found to be 1.86% and 1.97% respectively. Additionally, we have probed into the interaction of BSA with the synthesized nanocomposite using UV-visible, fluorescence and CD spectroscopic techniques along with computational techniques, namely molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations and MM-PBSA/ GBSA calculations. From the fluorescence quenching of BSA upon interaction with the SLNs, we deduced that a stable ground-state complex between 9-CH2OH Nos-Tel-SLN and BSA was formed. Similarly, in silico evaluation indicated formation of a stable dual drug complex with BSA with telmisartan being more compatible for binding to the protein. To assess further, we also evaluated the anticancer property of 9-CH2OH noscapine, telmisartan and 9-CH2OH Nos-Tel-SLN against H1299 lung cancer cell line using MTT assay and the calculated IC50 of 9-CH2OH Nos-Tel-SLN was 186 μg mL-1. Overall, based on the promising results in this research, such SLNs could be a promising drug delivery tool and can be crucial in the conversion of potential anticancer drugs to marketed anticancer drugs in the near future. © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216014042,Bovine serum albumin; Hydroxymethyl; Noscapine; Stearic acid; Telmisartan

Synthesis of 1-3 was accomplished by reacting Hahpa with zinc(II) precursors such as ZnCl2, Zn(NO3)2 6H2O and Zn(ClO4)2 6H2O, respectively, in the presence of NaOH at room temperature. Compounds 1-3 were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, electronic absorption and emission spectroscopy, molar conductivity analysis, and TGA studies. Elemental analysis, molar conductivity analysis, and UV-vis and fluorescence titration results unambiguously confirm the integrity of the compound frameworks. Moreover, the structures of 1-3 were ascertained by density functional theory (DFT) computation using the B3LYP/6-311G level of theory, indicating a distorted square pyramidal geometry around the zinc centers. Furthermore, the anticancer properties of 1-3 were assessed in human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines, revealing a significantly high cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 1.09 to 2.11 mM. They showed high selectivity between the normal and cancer cells despite this potency. The anticancer activity of 1-3 was possibly due to an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), destruction of cell membrane integrity, and DNA damage occurring via nuclear condensation. Electronic absorption spectroscopy, ethidium bromide (EB) displacement assay and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed the binding affinity and binding mode of 1-3 with DNA in a dose-dependent manner. All three compounds were also able to modulate the expression of p53 tumour suppressor protein and exhibited antitumorigenic activity, whereas their activity remained unaltered in the normal cell. When a comparative assessment of anticancer properties of 1-3 was made, 1 showed a higher cytotoxicity towards the cancer cells in comparison to 2 and 3.  © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216734532,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, natural ligand cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and CDN derivatives have demonstrated limited efficacy in clinical trials. This limitation stems from the inherent structure of CDNs, which leads to enzymatic degradation, poor cell internalisation, rapid clearance from the tumour microenvironment, and dose-limiting toxicity. In this study, we developed an amphipathic STING agonist, termed albumin-binding CDNs (AlbiCDNs), to enhance the efficacy of c-di-GMP (CDG) via a lipid-conjugated strategy. The lipid provided a platform for albumin hitchhiking, which facilitated the cytoplasmic delivery of CDG without the use of any exogenous components. In addition, incorporating a stimuli-responsive lipid motif further enhanced the cellular release of CDG. Our results indicated that CDG-1C14, an AlbiCDN, efficiently stimulated the maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells through STING activation. Furthermore, CDG-1C14 exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the tumour therapeutic model. Therefore, AlbiCDN is a potent platform for cancer immunotherapy that can expedite clinical translation. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003494159,Cancer Immunotherapy; Sting

According to our strategy, fragments of tacrine and donepezil were merged in a unique hybrid structure. After successfully synthesizing the compounds, they were evaluated for their dual AChE/BuChE inhibitor potential and neuroprotector response using a glutamate-induced excitotoxicity model. Most of the compounds showed promising activity. Among them, the hybrid with 2,5-dimetoxysubstitution (3b) was the most potent analogue, triggering dual potent AChE/BuChE inhibition with low nanomolar affinity (IC50 ∼ 300 nM) and low toxicity to human liver cancer cells (HepG2). This analogue prevented the glutamate excitotoxic stimulus during pre/post treatment testing, maintained ATP levels, possessed an astrocytic protective response, and abolished the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Besides, the hit compound 3b exhibited suitable permeability in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and low degradability in human blood-plasma. In addition, the docking studies suggested that the neuroprotectant response exhibited by 3b can be related to the direct blockage of the NMDA channel pore. Finally, an ideal neuropharmacokinetic profile was estimated for 3b.

In this work, novel approaches, such as C- and N-terminal modification and cyclization, to improve the proteolytic stability and bioavailability of the CT10 peptide are presented. These efforts resulted in a set of unprecedented potent cyclic inhibitors of HC-mediated ATP release with a half-life largely exceeding 24 hours. Additionally, the introduction of a lipophilic moiety with different solubilizing linkers led to the generation of a novel series of water-soluble and lipidated peptides that exhibited high inhibitory capacity in in vitro assays at submicromolar concentrations.

Residing beyond the rule-of-five space, they pose challenges in terms of physicochemical properties. With this study, we contribute to enhancing the understanding of their early ADME characterization. For permeability assessment, transwell assays such as Caco-2 remain challenging. Although the addition of serum may reduce unspecific binding and improve recovery, the assay was not found predictive for absorption. As a surrogate, we propose to focus optimization on molecular descriptors and support a preferred space for oral PROTACs© with ≤3 H-bond donors (HBDs), molecular weight (MW) ≤950 Da and number of rotatable bonds ≤12. We have developed a predictive score serving as initial guidance for design and prioritization according to this property space. In addition, the reduction of exposed polar surface area, e.g. through shielding of HBDs, is a powerful approach to optimize permeability. Using standard small molecule-based methods for in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) of intrinsic clearance (CLint) with experimentally determined hepatocyte CLint and fraction unbound in plasma, and predicted fraction unbound in the incubation (fu,inc), a systematic under-prediction from mouse hepatocytes was observed for PROTACs©. In line with our observation that the Kilford equation was not suitable for PROTAC© fu,inc prediction, this bias could be overcome by using experimentally determined fu,inc. Taken together, this study suggests a tailored in vitro DMPK discovery assay cascade and frontloading in vivo studies.

The nanoparticles were synthesized using mussel-extracted selenium with two reducing agents: d-glucose and orange. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed the presence of selenium. The reducing agent and duration influenced the nanoparticle size. Reduction with d-glucose for 1 hour revealed that the particles exhibited an average size of 10 nm. Copper sulfate-induced malformations such as yolk sac and pericardial edema were observed with 25 μg ml−1 of orange-reduced nanoparticles, while d-glucose-reduced nanoparticles mitigated these malformations at 25 μg ml−1. Treatment with stabilized Se-NPs reduced with d-glucose for 30 minutes showed 33% dose-dependent radical scavenging activities, upregulated approximately 2-fold of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase encoding genes and restored homeostasis by decreasing lipid peroxidation (27.32 nmol mg−1 ml−1) and nitric oxide levels (6.71 μM). They also had the potential to restore cognitive properties such as larval movement (93.40 m) without altering larval behaviour.

The developed formulation (TCS/PEG-B/GNPs) demonstrated the ability to dissolve in aqueous media and provided good stability. An antibacterial investigation was conducted using drug-resistant bacterial strains, Escherichia coli (E. coli) BAA-1161 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as model bacteria. The results showed that TCS/PEG-B/GNPs had the highest antibacterial activity. The MRSA strain demonstrated greater susceptibility to TCS (both TCS alone and TCS in the formulation) than E. coli BAA-1161. The cytotoxicity assay was also conducted in THP-1 cells and it was found that the viability of THP-1 cells treated with a 5× dilution of TCS/PEG-B/GNPs was higher than 80%.

Human plasma significantly reduced the uptake of PEO-PCL micelles, while PEO-PBCL micelles' uptake remained low. Proteomic analysis identified 23 distinct proteins among the combined top 20 most abundant proteins from each PM corona, with 18 common across all micelle types. In the top 10 proteins, PEO-PCL micelles shared an identical profile, whereas PEO-PBCL micelles had two unique proteins not present in PEO-PCL coronas.

Chen S.; Triki M.; Pinto Carneiro S.; Merkel O.M.,A novel micelleplex for tumour-targeted delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 against KRAS-mutated lung cancer,2025,Nanoscale,10.1039/d4nr03471f,"CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a highly effective and customizable genome editing tool, holding significant promise for the treatment of KRAS mutations in lung cancer. In this study, we introduce a novel micelleplex, named C14-PEI, designed to co-deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA efficiently to excise the mutated KRAS allele in lung cancer cells. C14-PEI is synthesised from 1,2-epoxytetradecane and branched PEI 600 Da via a ring-opening reaction. The resulting C14-PEI has a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of approximately 20.86 ± 0.15 mg L−1, indicating its ability to form stable micelles at low concentrations. C14-PEI efficiently encapsulates mRNA into micelleplexes through electrostatic interactions. When the mass ratio is 8 (w/w 8), the C14-PEI formulation exhibits conducive properties, which showed encapsulation efficiency of eGFP mRNA at 99% and led to a 130-fold increase in eGFP expression in A549 cells compared to untreated cells, demonstrating the robust delivery and expression capability of the micelleplexes. Importantly, toxicity tests using intracellular reduction of a tetrazolium salt revealed no significant cytotoxicity, underscoring the biocompatibility of C14-PEI. C14-PEI also shows high efficiency in co-encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA, as confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. At an sgRNA to Cas9 mRNA molar ratio of 10, the micelleplexes successfully mediate the cutting of mutated KRAS with an indel efficiency exceeding 60%, as determined by the T7 Endonuclease I (T7EI) assay. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) further demonstrates that the gene editing efficiency, measured by edited gene copies, is 48.5% in the w/w 4 group and 37.8% in the w/w 8 group. Treatment with C14-PEI micelleplexes containing Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA targeting the KRAS G12S mutation significantly impairs the migration capability of A549 cells and increases apoptosis rates. These findings suggest that C14-PEI effectively disrupts KRAS signalling pathways, leading to reduced tumor cell proliferation and enhanced cell death. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000752141,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Another emerging field is the fabrication of biopolymeric nanoparticles using albumin as a building block to achieve highly-tunable nonimmunogenic capsules or scaffolds that may be cheaply and reliably produced. The aim of this study was to characterize and optimize the desolvation process used for fabrication of albumin nanoparticles under ambient conditions, studying both glutaraldehyde (GT) and glucose (GLU) as crosslinking agents and the effect of various synthesis conditions including pH, electrolyte concentration, and rate of desolvation on particle size and stability. Particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential were investigated, morphology was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and long-term stability and degradation modes were studied using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was determined that the optimized synthesis procedure for synthesis of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) nanoparticles at the investigated scale under ambient conditions was addition of ethanol at a rate of 0.625 mL min−1via infusion against the vial wall and a pH of 9 with the addition of no other electrolytes. Optimized BSA nanoparticles were synthesized at a size of 86 ± 3.7 nm (σ = 1.85) using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker and a size of 92 ± 1.9 nm (σ = 0.95) using glucose as a crosslinker with polydispersity indices of 0.08 and 0.05, respectively. Nanoparticles synthesized via the optimized procedure, using both crosslinkers, were found to maintain colloidal stability significantly longer than cases previously reported in the literature, with insignificant changes in hydrodynamic size many months after synthesis. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215924821,Bovine serum albumin; Characterization; Serum Albumin

Effective imaging is crucial for diagnosing and managing IBD, as it allows for accurate assessment of disease severity, guides treatment decisions, and monitors therapeutic responses. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast agents is the gold standard for imaging the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). However, current agents are less effective in obese patients and lack specificity for inflamed regions associated with IBD. Moreover, IBD treatments often have limited efficacy and do not address the role of oxidative stress in IBD progression. This study explores dextran-coated cerium oxide nanoparticles (Dex-CeNP) as a CT contrast agent and therapeutic for IBD, leveraging cerium's superior K-edge energy profile, dextran's inflammation-specific targeting, and cerium oxide's antioxidant properties. Herein, we synthesized Dex-CeNP formulations using 5, 10, 25, and 40 kDa dextran to explore the effect of dextran coating molecular weight. In vitro assays showed formulation biocompatibility and demonstrated that 5 kDa Dex-CeNP had the highest catalytic activity, which translated into improved suppression of inflammation. As a result, this formulation was selected for in vivo use. In vivo CT imaging of mice subjected to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis showed that Dex-CeNP provided better contrast in the GIT of mice with colitis compared to iopamidol (ISO), with pronounced attenuation in the large intestine and disease- specific retention at 24 h. Additionally, Dex-CeNP significantly decreased Disease Activity Index (DAI) scores, and diminished gastrointestinal bleeding when compared with a currently approved drug, indicating that it is an effective treatment for colitis. Studies also revealed that the Dex-CeNPs were safe and well-excreted following administration. In summary, Dex-CeNP has significant promise as a dual-purpose agent for CT imaging and treatment of IBD. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003008825,Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Molecular Imaging

They have been explored for optoelectronic applications in combination with fluorescent proteins towards bio-hybrid light-emitting diodes (Bio-HLEDs) only recently. However, protein integration within the cage or coassembled ferritin cages relies on electrostatic interactions and requires the supercharging of the fluorescent protein that easily compromises functionality and stability. To address this limitation, we have developed a fusion protein combining the Thermotoga maritima apoferritin (TmaFt) with a green fluorescent protein named mGreenlantern (mGL). This approach avoids jeopardizing both the cage assembly capability of TmaFt and the photophysical features of mGL. After optimizing the fusion protein mGL-TmaFt with respect to the linker length, assembling efficiency, and mGL payload into the cage (mGL@TmaFt), our findings reveal that they exhibited enhanced thermal and structural stabilities in both solution and when embedded into a polymer matrix. This enables effective mGL shielding, reducing H-transfer deactivation of the chromophore and water-assisted heat transfer across the polymer network. Indeed, the photo-induced heat generation in Bio-HLEDs operating at high currents was significantly reduced, resulting in a 30- and 15-fold higher device stability compared to references with either mGL or mGL-TmaFt proteins, respectively. Overall, this work sets in the potential of protein cage design for photon manipulation in protein lighting devices. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002014440,Cage; Fluorescent protein

One such system, the subcutaneous injection site simulator (SCISSOR), incorporates hyaluronic acid (HA) as a model of the subcutaneous extracellular matrix (ECM), which dictates the diffusion of test compounds. However, the native ECM found is markedly more complex. Here for the first time, we compared the permeation of macromolecules with different physicochemical properties (molecular weight and charge) and model biological molecules across the HA hydrogel (used in SCISSOR) and an animal-derived basement membrane extract (BME), an ECM. We coated tissue culture inserts with these matrices as a simple experimental set up to test the permeation. The results show that the two matrices displayed similarities and some notable differences in their performance as barriers for macromolecules of different properties, suggesting that a simple experimental setup utilising biologically derived ECM may act as an inexpensive and accessible tool to predict the in vivo performance of biotherapeutics for SC administration. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006989927,Matrix (chemical analysis)

Common treatment protocols rely on surgical removal of tumors and chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, which are capable of reaching cancer cells throughout the body. However, the effectiveness of these drugs is often limited due to toxic reactions in patients, nonspecific drug distribution affecting healthy cells, and the development of treatment resistance. In this study, we introduce a polybasic nanogel system composed of poly(diethylaminoethyl methacrylate-co-cyclohexyl methacrylate)-g-poly(ethylene glycol) designed for the targeted co-delivery of paclitaxel and carboplatin directly to ovarian cancer cells. These nanogel systems can respond to the cellular microenvironment to achieve controlled, on-demand drug release, reducing off-target effects and enhancing therapeutic uptake. Additionally, we investigated nanoparticle degradation and controlled drug release as a function of various crosslinkers, including tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, bis(2-methacryloyl)oxyethyl disulfide, poly(lactic acid)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic acid)dimethacrylate, and polycaprolactone dimethacrylate. Our results, using OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cells, demonstrated that this dual-delivery system outperformed free drugs in inducing cancer cell death, representing a promising advance in the field of nanoparticle-based therapies for ovarian cancer. By loading two chemotherapeutic agents into a single, environmentally responsive particle, this approach shows the potential to overcome common resistance mechanisms and achieve more effective tumor suppression. In summary, by delivering chemotherapy more precisely, it may be possible to enhance therapeutic outcomes while minimizing toxicity and nonspecific drug distribution, ultimately improving patient quality of life. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007040123,Carboplatin; Cationic polymerization

The structures of Os3 and Os5 were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, and Os5 exhibits a bathochromic shift in its absorption band compared to the other complexes, likely due to the electron-donating properties of the substituent NMe2. Os5 also hydrolyzed without losing its BTAT ligand and exhibited the highest cellular accumulation in Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cancer cells. The investigated Os(II) complexes demonstrated moderate antiproliferative activity across six cancer cell lines, with Os5 being the most potent, showing activity comparable to or better than conventional cisplatin. Cellular accumulation was a key factor influencing their antiproliferative effect, though binding to human serum albumin did not play a significant role. Further studies with Os5 in RD cells, the most responsive cell line, revealed that its mechanism of action includes mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis via a caspasedependent pathway, and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Os5 also increased the production/generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in RD cells, implicating ROS production as a contributor to its activity. Importantly, Os5 was effective against cancer stem cells (CSCs) in 3D spheroid models, marking the first report of an osmium-based compound targeting CSC-enriched RD cells. This highlights the potential of Os5 as a CSC-targeted therapy, addressing the need for treatments that prevent relapse and metastasis.

However, its application is limited by severe side effects and drug resistance. The combination of platinum-based chemotherapeutics with EGFR inhibitors has shown remarkable synergism in clinical treatment. To enhance the tolerability of this combination, we designed a novel multi-action oxaliplatin-based platinum(IV) complex with an EGFR-inhibiting moiety (KP2749). KP2749 releases two independent cytotoxic agents upon reduction: oxaliplatin and the EGFR inhibitor KP2187, which was selected for its strong intrinsic fluorescence that became quenched upon complexation to metal ions. In particular, KP2749 demonstrated high stability and specific KP2187 release, with quenched fluorescent properties in its intact form, facilitating the investigation of its intracellular reduction. Notably, by exploiting its fluorescence, we demonstrated that intact KP2749 itself exhibited EGFR-inhibitory properties. Furthermore, subsequent experiments indicated that our complex was able to overcome resistance to oxaliplatin and EGFR inhibitors in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. These effects were not only based on EGFR inhibition and DNA damage, but also improved cellular drug uptake. Finally, in silico docking analysis confirmed that the intact KP2749 complex had EGFR-binding properties, which were different from free KP2187. Consequently, these data suggested that the coordination of EGFR inhibitors to metal cores (like platinum) allow the fine-tuning of their EGFR-targeting properties. In conclusion, this study not only presents a new potential anticancer drug but also offers a novel fluorescent tool to study the intracellular drug release kinetics of platinum(IV) complexes. © the Partner Organisations 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214680452,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Human blood serum is a reservoir of high molecular weight fraction (HMWF) and low molecular weight fraction (LMWF) proteins. The LMWF proteins are considered disease marker proteins and are often suppressed by HMWF proteins during analysis. This issue is addressed by using a filtration device to isolate the filtrate portion from blood serum samples having biomarker proteins up to the size of the cutoff value of the filtration device. In this research, 100 kDa filter devices are employed to obtain the filtrate portions from blood serum samples of type II diabetes mellitus patients and healthy volunteers, followed by characterization using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as the SERS substrate. By using this approach, the collected filtrate is expected to contain marker proteins at a size of <100 kDa, which are associated with type II diabetes. These marker proteins are in a narrow size range (cutoff value of 100 kDa). Hence, they may be more easily identified by their characteristic SERS spectral features as compared to their analysis in the respective whole blood serum samples due to the exclusion of larger size proteins. These proteins that are present in the filtrate portions of type II diabetes may include adiponectin, C-reactive protein, insulin, leptin, RBP4, IL-6, TNF-a, Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21), albumin, transthyretin, alpha-antitrypsin, transferrin, apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1) and fetuin-A.

Moreover, the SERS spectral data sets of various samples are classified using two chemometric approaches: principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).

Mildly fractionated soluble pea protein (containing 2.5 wt% protein), recovered by centrifuging pea protein concentrate dispersion at pH 2.0, was directly used to prepare a 5 wt% canola oil-in-water emulsion using a high-pressure homogenizer. Emulsion stability was evaluated at pH 2.0 for 28 days at room temperature as well as against environmental stress conditions, including heat treatment (90 °C, 30 min) in the presence and absence of NaCl (0-1 M). The results showed that the acidic water-soluble pea protein, rich in albumins, exhibited excellent emulsifying properties and improved thermal stability, showing minor changes in droplet size until day 28, even after heat treatment. We proposed that such improved emulsion thermal stability under acidic conditions could be due to the high albumin content, lower surface hydrophobicity and higher β-sheet and random coil secondary structure content of the acidic-soluble fraction compared to the whole pea protein pH 7.0 extracts. However, the emulsions were unstable against high salt concentrations (0.5 and 1 M NaCl), showing extensive aggregation worsened by heating, which was attributed to the charge screening effect of salt and unfavourable conformational change in the albumin-rich proteins. The novel findings of this study can provide essential knowledge and set the stage for the development of pea protein ingredients ideal for utilization in ready-to-drink acidic plant-based beverages. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007853831,Heat stability; Pea protein

The experimental results suggest that as-fabricated BSA-Cu NPs can strongly catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to produce oxidized substances, accompanied by remarkable color changes of chromogenic agent 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine from colorless to blue, revealing peroxidase-like activities of BSA-Cu NPs. However, owing to the strong binding affinity between dopamine (DA) and BSA-Cu NPs, the catalytic activities of synthesized BSA-Cu NPs are inhibited, leading to a significant decrement of absorption peak signal.

Bioactivity and pharmacokinetic parameters were further analyzed, encompassing ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) characteristics. This study highlights the potential of spiro thiochromene-oxindoles as anti-inflammatory agents, warranting further exploration as potential leads. The synthetic strategy for these target compounds utilizes taurine as an eco-friendly bio-organic catalyst, facilitating an acid-, base-, and metal-free intramolecular C-S and C-C bond formation in aqueous media. The reaction involves a one-pot, three-component Knoevenagel-Thia-Michael cascade between substituted isatins, 1,3-dicarbonyls, and 2-naphthalene thiol. Key features of this green protocol include high yields, cost-efficiency, non-toxicity, atom economy, and acid-, base-, and metal-free synthesis in water. Additionally, the catalyst exhibits excellent reusability, maintaining its activity across three cycles with easy recovery, while product isolation is achieved through simple filtration, eliminating the need for chromatographic purification and organic solvents. These attributes underscore this approach's synthetic and environmental advantages, highlighting its potential for broader application in the development of anti-inflammatory agents. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215755959,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

In this study, new types of nanocomposite hydrogels composed of zoledronic acid/strontium hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and carboxymethyl chitosan/oxidized dextran (CMC/OD) hydrogels were reported. Pure hydroxyapatite, 5%, 10% and 15% (w/w) strontium-substituted strontium hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were produced and then modified with zoledronic acid at ratios of 5% to 7.5% (w/w). These modified structures were then incorporated into CMC/OD hydrogels. Zoledronic acid modified strontium hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). CMC/OD structures were investigated using Fourier Transform Infrared Analysis (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The physical properties of the hydrogels were determined via degradation behavior and rheological measurements. Cell-material interactions were investigated in vitro. The results showed that the incorporation of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles into CMC would significantly improve the rheological properties. The addition of strontium to hydroxyapatite nanoparticles significantly enhanced cell proliferation. In addition, a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and calcium deposition was observed with the addition of zoledronic acid.

However, excess accumulation of l-Dopa in the body may cause movement disorders and uncontrollable emotions. Therefore, it is vital to monitor l-Dopa levels in patients. In this study, a carbon dot (CD)-based fluorescence sensing system was developed for sensitive detection of l-Dopa. The CDs were prepared using a novel biomass, Pandanus amaryllifolius Roxb., as a carbon source via a simple hydrothermal method. Interestingly, it was found that ethylenediamine doping in the preparation system increased the quantum yield of CDs, as well as their fluorescence response sensitivity to l-Dopa.

The LSNRs were doped with gadolinium ions (Gd3+) and coated with graphene oxide (GO) to prepare bimetallic LSNRs (B@LSNRs) and GO templates (B@LGTs), respectively. LSNRs, B@LSNRs, and B@LGTs were characterised using XRD, FT-IR spectroscopy, BET analysis, UV/vis spectroscopy, HR-TEM, SEM, TGA/DTG, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The B@LGTs as interstitial photocatalysts photocatalytically reduced the Coomassie brilliant blue red (BBR) dye, transition metal ions (TMIs), and quinonoid phenolphthalein (QHIn) in aqueous solutions under visible light. Experimental parameters including pollutant concentrations, B@LGT dosages, physicochemical properties (PCPs), and pH were optimized for achieving monodispersion and maximum PCR.

This study developed a dual-drug (luliconazole: LZ, and niacinamide: NM) loaded lipid nanocarrier (LN)-laden gel for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis. The LNs were prepared using cholesterol and soya-α-lecithin through a thin-film hydration technique. The average vesicle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of the optimized LZNMLNs were 126.40 ± 1.30 nm, 0.276, and −34.6 ± 0.8 mV, respectively, and the formulation showed the sustained release of both drugs over an extended period. Selected LZNMLNs were incorporated into a bio-adhesive gel. The optimized LZNMLNs-gel showed excellent viscosity, spreadability, and bio-adhesiveness. The optimized LZNMLNs-gel exhibited significantly higher permeation of LZ (1.46-fold) and NM (1.55-fold) than LZNM gel. The optimized LZNMLNs-gel showed significantly higher in vitro antifungal activity (ZOI = 34 ± 2 mm) than commercial Candid V gel (18 ± 1 mm). The optimized LZNMLNs-gel did not show any cytotoxicity against vaginal epithelial cells. The bioavailability of LZNMLNs-gel was significantly (P < 0.05) increased (1.94-fold for LZ and 1.33-fold for NM) compared to Candid V, with a decrease in total clearance indicating sustained release of the drug, which may lead to the maintenance of therapeutic concentration for an extended period. In vivo antifungal activity showed that the optimized LZNMLNs-gel completely treated the infection on the 7th day of treatment in an induced rabbit model, compared to the commercial gel (Candid V gel, 10 days).

The MUA functionalization provides a stable platform for immobilizing the CD144 antibody, ensuring the detection of the target protein. This biosensor combines Au-SPE technology with an immunoassay, offering a rapid, sensitive, and non-invasive method for detection of CD144 carried by EVs. Characterization of saliva-derived EVs using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) confirmed their morphology and size, which fell within the expected range of 80-180 nm. NTA indicated a lower concentration of particles in saliva-EVs than in serum-EVs (controls), highlighting the need for sensitive detection of EV cargos in this type of EV. Immunodetection confirmed the presence of CD144 in both saliva and serum-derived EVs, with higher concentrations in serum. Functionalization of Au-SPEs with MUA and CD144 antibodies was confirmed by significant resistance changes, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to verify the preservation of EV morphology and their capturing post-immune adsorption. A calibration curve demonstrated the high sensitivity of the biosensor prototype for detecting CD144-positive EVs, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.111 ng mL−1 and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.37 ng mL−1, requiring only 3 μL of EV-sample. This biosensor shows potential as a novel method for detecting and studying endothelial biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease in EVs isolated from saliva, a capability not currently available with existing tools.

This study thermodynamic properties, solubility measurements and spectrofluorometric method were used for investigating the interactions between fluconazole (FCZ) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs). Five choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were synthesized. Each DES was prepared by combining choline chloride (a hydrogen bond acceptor, HBA) with a different hydrogen bond donor (HBD): oxalic acid (OX), malonic acid (MA), ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol (G), or urea (U). Subsequently, the interactions between fluconazole (FCZ) and these synthesized DESs were investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy at a temperature of 298.15 K. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a strong interaction between fluconazole (FCZ) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs). This was evident from the significant quenching of FCZ's intrinsic fluorescence upon DES addition. The association constant and binding sites were determined. Among the tested DESs, the choline chloride-oxalic acid mixture exhibited the strongest interaction with FCZ. Furthermore, the solubility of FCZ in DES-water mixtures studied at a temperature range of (298.15 to 313.15) K was found to increase with increasing DES concentration. The solubility data were accurately fitted using the e-NRTL and Wilson thermodynamic models. To gain deeper insights, conductor-like screening model (COSMO) calculations were performed on the studied systems. The obtained surface cavity volume and dielectric solvation energy provide valuable information about the intermolecular interactions. Finally, thermodynamic analysis using Gibbs and van't Hoff equations indicated that the dissolution of FCZ in these systems is an endothermic process. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002587215,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Here we report an effective strategy for developing novel heterocycle-fused 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) compounds to control the aggregation and toxicity of both metal-free Aβ and metal-Aβ. We designed and synthesized these compounds by fusing BQ with 3-pyrazolone responsible for metal chelation. The compounds' ability to form covalent bonds with Aβ is tuned by the annulation of the BQ moiety and the type, position, and number of substituents on the 3-pyrazolone group. Furthermore, the BQ functionality on the 3-pyrazolone framework can undergo o-hydroxylation, enhancing its metal chelation in a bidentate manner. Our results demonstrate that these heterocycle-fused BQ compounds can redirect the assembly of Aβ into less toxic aggregates by binding to metal ions, modifying Aβ structures in both the absence and presence of metal ions, and promoting oxidative changes to Aβ. This study highlights the importance of structural modifications and optimizations of BQ to leverage its strength of covalently cross-linking to Aβ and overcome its limitations in metal chelation and cytotoxicity, which are critical for designing chemical modulators for metal-free Aβ and metal-Aβ.

However, the plethora of solvent accessible lysine residues, which often have similar reactivity, is a key inherent issue when searching for regioselectivity and/or controlled loading of an entity. A relevant example is the modification of antibodies and/or antibody fragments, whose conjugates offer potential for a wide variety of applications. Thus, research in this area for the controlled loading of an entity via reaction with lysine residues is of high importance. In this article, we present an approach to achieve this by exploiting the quantitative and reversible site-selective modification of disulfides using pyridazinediones, which facilitates near-quantitative proximity-induced reactions with lysines to enable controlled loading of an entity.

Herein, we present a two-dimensional orthogonal fluorescence and chemiluminescence design strategy for the probe DCM-SA, which is sequentially activated by albumin-mediated hydrolysis, exhibiting light-up fluorescence and photo-induced cycloaddition generating chemiluminescence, enabling orthogonal signal amplification for discrimination of subtle differences between similar proteins. By orthogonalizing these dual-mode signals, a two-dimensional work curve of fluorescence and chemiluminescence is established to distinguish and quantify similar proteins HSA and BSA. Importantly, the dual-mode signals of DCM-SA exhibit contrary incremental trends towards HSA and BSA. Molecular docking and femtosecond transient absorbance spectroscopy reveal that the lower KD value of DCM-SA with HSA and the longer excited-state lifetime of DCM-SA with BSA underlie the distinct dual-mode responses. Using two-dimensional orthogonal signals, for the first time, we precisely measure the HSA/BSA ratio in mixed serum. This method facilitates rapid blood source identification and trace HSA quantitation in human urine.

We employed a “chelate-then-click” strategy, wherein a bifunctional chelator was designed in two parts, which were subsequently joined post-labelling and post-conjugation via the strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) reaction. Cysteine-selective conjugation of the VHH was achieved through thiol-Michael addition, forming a VHH-DBCO construct. Radiolabelling of the azide-functionalised chelator with [188Re]Re(v) was optimised to achieve a radiochemical conversion of ∼70%, despite challenges associated with maintaining the azide functionality under reducing conditions. The final product, [188Re]Re-VHH, demonstrated high radiochemical purity and good in vitro stability over 48 h. In vitro cell-binding studies against U87MG and BxPC3 cell lines proved the retention of c-Met binding post-labelling. In vivo biodistribution studies on mice bearing BxPC3 tumour xenografts, however, exhibited suboptimal tumour uptake, likely a result of the low molar activity (1.4-3.3 MBq nmol−1) of the radioconjugate.

The unique structural features of GSH, including the reductive thiol and multiple coordination sites (carboxyl and amino group), make it a significant molecule not only in the physiological context but also as a ligand in the development of functional metal nanomaterials. In this context, GSH's role as a protective ligand and reducing agent in surface etching and ligand exchange reactions has been explored at the molecular level, expanding the diversity of GSH-protected metal nanomaterials. With photoluminescence (PL) as one of its most intriguing properties, investigations into GSH's influence on PL properties emphasize its multifaceted coordination capabilities in surface coating, charge transfer from electron-rich functional groups, chirality arising from its unique structure, and available conjugation sites. Moreover, the biocompatibility of GSH, combined with the synergistic effect of metal components, renders GSH-protected nanomaterials an “Inseparable Duo” highly suited for applications in bio-sensing, bio-imaging via PL radiative decay and anti-cancer bio-therapies through photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and radiotherapy.

While portable analytical devices for blood glucose have been sophisticatedly developed, those for haemoglobin (Hb) and, especially haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a glycated form of Hb, remain elusive. Here, we developed an aptamer-based duplexed electrochemical sensor for the simultaneous detection of Hb and HbA1c. Ferrocene (Fc) and a thiol group were introduced to the 5′ and 3′-end of aptamers that bind Hb and HbA1c, respectively. While the thiol group facilitates the formation of a self-assembled monolayer of the aptamers onto a customized, duplexed screen-printed gold electrode, the presence of Fc provides the electrodes an internal electrochemical signal. Upon analyte binding, the secondary conformation of the aptamers is changed, thus leading to a quenched current signal because of an increased distance between Fc and the electrode surface. Our duplexed electrochemical sensor showed a good linearity for both analytes over a wide concentration range, and has proved effective in simultaneously quantifying Hb and HbA1c in calibration samples. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215688253,Glycated haemoglobin; Glycated hemoglobin

Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli aggregates to dynamic changes in the growth conditions. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystals. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be a common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002681835,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The unfolding of proteins induced by urea is typically attributed to specific mechanisms; however, the influence of urea on protein-protein interactions, which can give rise to protein crystallization and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), remains less understood. In this study, we examine the modulation of protein-protein interactions by urea at non-denaturing concentrations, in combination with sodium chloride. The effects of these additives on the state diagram and protein-protein interactions in lysozyme solutions are analyzed using optical microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), respectively. Our findings indicate that the addition of urea diminishes net protein attractions, while the introduction of salt enhances them, resulting in respective shifts of the state boundaries. Moreover, the protein-protein interactions can be effectively characterized by a Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) potential.

The targeted BT molecules were synthesized by the Stille cross-coupling reaction and their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon blue-light irradiation was demonstrated. For practical exploitation, BTs were embedded into an alginate matrix by ionotropic gelation–freeze drying processes to obtain porous aerogels that were dispersed in water and used for the degradation of emerging contaminants.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) offer multiple important advantages for drug delivery, including stability, protection of active substances, and sustained release capabilities. However, tracking their structural integrity and dynamic behaviour in complex biological environments remains challenging. Here, we report the development of a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-enabled LNP platform that achieves unprecedented sensitivity and precision in monitoring nanoparticle disintegration. The FRET-based LNPs were prepared using nanoprecipitation, encapsulating high levels of 3,30- dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) and 1,10-dioctadecyl- 3,3,30,30-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) fluorophores as the donor and acceptors, respectively. The resulting LNPs had a mean diameter of 114 _ 19 nm with a distinct FRET signal. An optimal energy transfer efficiency of 0.98 and an emission quantum yield of 0.13 were achieved at 11.1% fluorophore loading in the LNPs, balancing efficient energy transfer and minimal aggregation-induced quenching. Using the FRET reporting, three dissociation stages of FRET LNPs were observed: solvation, indicated by an increased emission intensity; swelling and partial dissolution, evidenced by changes in emission maxima and mean size; and complete dissociation, confirmed by emission solely from DiO and the absence of particles. Testing the nanoparticles in live cells (telomerase-immortalised human corneal epithelial cells, hTCEpi cells) revealed a direct link to the disappearance of the FRET signal with the dissociation of FRET NPs. The nanoparticles initially exhibited a strong extracellular FRET signal, which diminished after cellular internalisation. This suggests that the LNPs disintegrate after entering the cells. These findings establish FRET-based LNPs as a robust tool for real-time nanoparticle tracking, offering insights into their integrity and release mechanisms, with potential applications in advanced drug delivery and diagnostics.  © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216700532,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We report label-free detection of human serum albumin (HSA) using a leaky waveguide (LW) optical biosensor. The LW reported in this work comprised a few microns-thick mesoporous polyacrylamide hydrogel film deposited on a glass substrate by casting and, for the first time, copolymerized with N-(3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide (APMAA) to provide functional amine groups required to immobilise recognition elements, half-antibody fragments. Furthermore, this is an unprecedented report on the use of a high molecular weight (3700 D) poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylamide in contrast to previously reported low molecular weight bis-acrylamide crosslinkers to increase the porosity of waveguide films. Equally, other parameters such as molar ratio of APMAA to acrylamide and total weight of (monomers and crosslinker) to volume ratio were optimised to obtain hydrogel films with pore size and amine groups required to immobilise half-antibody fragments in hydrogel films. Three different strategies for immobilisation of recognition elements; two based on streptavidin biotin interactions and the third based on half fragments of antibody were studied. The third immobilisation strategy resulted in the most reproducible results and hence was used to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant of HSA and its corresponding half-antibody fragments. Using the LW-based label-free optical biosensor, HSA was successfully detected with a limit of detection of 28 ng mL−1 in buffer and the lowest concentration of HSA measured in this work was 66.5 ng mL−1.

Sustainable marine-origin polysaccharides have been used for developing hydrogels due to their proven biocompatibility, non-cytotoxicity and wide bioavailability from renewable resources. In particular, chitosan (CHT) and alginate (ALG) have been widely employed to develop hydrogels, taking advantage of their opposite charge nature.

Protein secondary structures are commonly assessed using circular dichroism spectroscopy, followed by relevant downstream analysis using specialized software.

Specifically, we leverage supervised machine learning to analyze the circular dichroism spectra and relevant attributes of 112 proteins to predict their secondary structures. Based on a range of spectral, structural, and molecular features, we systematically evaluate the predictive performance of numerous supervised classifiers and identify optimal combinations of algorithms with descriptors to achieve highly accurate and precise estimations of protein secondary structures.

Current research suggests that tendon injuries are affected by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory responses, and type III collagen deposition. These factors lead to an imbalance between extrinsic and intrinsic tendon healing and are the main reasons for the occurrence of peritendinous adhesions. In this study, we constructed a carrier using a polyvinyl alcohol/polyethylene glycol (PVA/PEG) dual network hydrogel and loaded it with zeolite imidazolium ester framework-8@CeO2 nano-enzymes (ZIF-8@CeO2) to form a nano-enzyme-functionalized hydrogel (PVA/PEG/ZIF-8@CeO2) therapeutic system. The surface of PVA/PEG/ZIF-8@CeO2 is rich in hydrophilic hydroxyl groups that form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, creating a hydrated layer that inhibits fibrin adsorption and fibroblast adhesion, reduces the impact of exogenous healing, and reduces the formation of adhesions. Similarly, the loaded ZIF-8@CeO2 has catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, which can effectively remove the excessive ROS in the injured tendon, down-regulate the inflammatory response, enhance the tendon differentiation of tendon stem cells, promote intrinsic healing, and ultimately promote the repair of injured tendons. Furthermore, the system can accelerate the transition from inflammation to repair and remodeling in the tendon healing process.

The photophysical properties of both the copper complex, Cu(NDI-Phen)Cl2 (Cu1) and the N-octyl-N-[1,10]phenanthroline-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic-diimide (NDI-Phen, L1) were probed using laser flash photolysis on the nano to microsecond timescales. The biological properties of the Cu1 complex and L1 were evaluated based on their interactions with DNA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and their antimicrobial properties against clinically important pathogens were determined. The binding affinity of the Cu1 complex with calf thymus DNA (CT DNA) was evaluated using UV-Vis absorption titrations, and fluorescence quenching measurements. The results indicate a stronger intercalative binding mode for the copper complex, compared to L1, suggesting enhanced stabilisation with the DNA helix. The interaction with BSA was also studied for the Cu1 complex, which exhibited a higher quenching and binding constant compared to L1. This suggests a stronger and more stable interaction with the protein, which may improve its bioavailability and resistance to degradation under physiological conditions. The Cu1 complex demonstrated superior antibacterial activity when compared to L1. These findings suggest that complexation of the NDI-Phen unit with a copper centre significantly improves its potential as an antibacterial agent. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012967053,Diimide; Phenanthroline
Dey C.; Pal P.; Ghosh R.; Dey S.G.,Copper-Aβ and cytochrome c: a potential Janus in Alzheimer's disease,2025,Dalton Transactions,10.1039/d5dt01594d,"Aβ peptides and cytochrome c (Cyt c) co-exist in the mitochondria. The interplay between Aβ and Cyt c is thus, crucial in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology, where oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are central features. However, the details of interaction between Cu bound Aβ and Cyt c remain unexplored at a molecular level. Previously it was demonstrated that reduced Cu-Aβ can react with O2 to result in H2O2. This H2O2 produced can oxidize neurotransmitters and this process is catalysed by the oxidized Cu-Aβ. Here spectroscopic analyses reveal that reduced Cu-Aβ transfers electron to oxidized Cyt c, which mitigates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reduced Cu-Aβ species. Thus, Cyt c can exhibit a protective role against ROS generation by Cu-Aβ. On the other hand, the oxidation of reduced Cyt c by H2O2 is significantly accelerated in the presence of Cu-Aβ, highlighting the thus far unknown intrinsic Cyt c peroxidase type activity of oxidized Cu-Aβ. Thus, the generation of oxidized Cyt c, catalyzed by Cu-Aβ, raises the possibility of apoptotic death of brain cells which is a common feature associated with AD, thereby revealing the other face of Janus. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012945252,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurements were performed to evaluate particle size distribution, surface charge and their stability both as standalone nanoparticles and in the presence of additives such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS), fulvic acid (FA) and natural organic matter (NOM). The results showed significant differences in stability between CDs and NDs, with CDs showing a tendency to aggregate, while NDs exhibited higher stability under different conditions. The addition of BSA, FA and NOM significantly affected the zeta potential, although the ND suspensions remained stable under acidic conditions. Conversely, DSS had minimal effects on the zeta potential, resulting in the stabilization effect in Milli-Q water. In NaCl suspensions, addition of additives resulted in aggregation, with the exception of NOM, which improved the stability of NDs under alkaline conditions. These results improve our understanding of the environmental behaviour of carbon-based nanoparticles and highlight the role of environmental factors and additives in their stability. This knowledge is crucial not only for evaluating their behaviour and potential impact on the aquatic environment but also for developing novel technologies that exploit their unique properties for sustainable and innovative applications. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010330223,Aqueous medium; Carbon fibers

However, the direct targets and mechanisms of action of these peptides in islet β-cells remain unclear. In this study, we found that PA1b-like peptides were mainly distributed in the cotyledon of soybean, rather than in the germ and seed coat. We also identified a direct interaction between PA1b-like peptides and voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), with binding energies less than −7 kcal mol−1. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces assist these peptides in forming stable and tight complexes with VDAC1. Moreover, as a member of the PA1B-like peptide family, vglycin (VG) protected mitochondrial function by maintaining the ROS level, ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), intracellular Ca2+ inflow and insulin secretion in β-cells under high glucose stimulation. All these effects were reliant on the direct interaction between VG and VDAC1 in β-cells. This study provides a new strategy for the restoration of mitochondrial function in β-cells under glucose toxicity and establishes a theoretical basis for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) by PA1b-like peptides. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219573486,VDAC1

While mouse-derived mAbs dominate current applications, their limitations—short serum half-life, human immunogenicity, and restricted recognition of human-specific antigens—highlight the need for alternative sources. Rabbit-derived mAbs have been gaining significant traction with their superior antigen-binding affinity, broader epitope diversity, and higher yield potential. However, the absence of well-defined surface markers on rabbit B cells has hindered efficient enrichment strategies, limiting the exploration of this valuable antibody repertoire. In this study, we present an integrated workflow that combines magnetic negative selection with high-throughput droplet microfluidics to overcome these barriers. By optimizing a pan B cell enrichment protocol using a tailored antibody cocktail, we achieved a notable boost in IgG secretion and B cell enrichment. Through two complementary droplet-encapsulated assays using particle aggregation for soluble antigens and reporter cells for membrane-bound antigens, we identified target cells capable of secreting high-affinity IgGs. Subsequent sequencing, in vitro antibody production and characterization confirmed the high affinity rate of the discovered antibodies, outperforming rates previously reported.

An important aspect that enhances these properties is the proper crosslinking of the materials. Therefore, in this study, we successfully produced films based on a mixture of chitosan and kefiran, crosslinked with kefiran dialdehyde. Our team obtained this crosslinker for the first time, and it is a safe alternative to standard agents such as glutaraldehyde. Moreover, to provide antimicrobial properties of the designed materials, we introduced an extract from the hemp variety “Henola” into the biopolymer matrix. Several analyses were performed to characterize the obtained films (such as FTIR-ATR, AFM, biodegradability, swelling rate, water vapor permeability, and mechanical properties). The biocompatibility of the films was tested using fibroblasts and erythrocytes, and their antimicrobial activity was examined against the bacteria and the fungus. The results showed that crosslinking with dialdehyde kefiran conferred strength and flexibility to the obtained films. Moreover, the film with the ethanol extract showed strong anti-inflammatory properties (86.4 ± 3.67%) and a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of S. aureus (the number of isolated cells was up to 5.7 log lower than that of the control). In addition, the materials do not exhibit hemolysis (≤5%) on contact with blood and are non-toxic to MRC-5 cells (after 24 hours, cell viability above 100%). Therefore, these films have promising potential for practical applications in wound dressing. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002306206,Biocompatible material

Three variants of BSA, namely BSA-A7030 (protease, fatty acid, and globulin free), BSA-A3059 (protease & globulin free), and BSA-A3294 (only protease free), were chosen. UV-vis-NIR absorption, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy studies showed no significant difference in the spectra of all the BSAs, but in the presence of Cu2+, a differential reactivity of the three BSA variants was noticed. The biophysical study of the BSA-ICG complexes (1 : 1 molar ratio) showed that post-binding, there was a significant red shift of the ICG peak (both absorption and fluorescence) for BSA-A7030 with a widening of the excitation-emission hotspot. The photothermal properties of the BSA-ICG complexes under NIR (808 nm) exposure were similar to those of free ICG, whereas the photodynamic property increases for BSA-A3059. All the BSA-ICG complexes were found to be cytocompatible when tested with the NIH 3T3 cell line in vitro. The effect of the BSA type on the 808 nm NIR-mediated phototherapeutic properties of the BSA-ICG complex was tested in vitro on lung cancer cell line A549 (2D model) and a 3D osteosarcoma spheroid model. The study showed a NIR-induced cytoskeletal disruption of A549 cells with maximum damage caused by the BSA-A7030-ICG complex. The same complex was found to show the highest phototherapeutic effect on the 3D spheroid model.

An integrated computational and experimental approach was employed, combining DFT calculations and molecular docking simulations to analyze quercetin's interactions with the MnFe2O4 surface across (011), (101), and (100) facets, alongside in vitro studies to assess drug loading and release, biocompatibility, and cytotoxicity on 4T1 cells. Molecular docking showed favorable binding energies between quercetin and BSA (−5.17 kcal mol−1 with Subdomain IIA), demonstrating that quercetin, even when bound to the BSA coating, retained strong interactions with the oxide surface. Reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis revealed facet-dependent adsorption mechanisms, correlating binding affinity towards Mn (through oxygen-containing functional groups) with steric interactions shown as red areas on the RDG plot. Analysis unveiled the interactions and structural features of each facet of the drug complex. Experimentally, the TEM imaging revealed the nanoparticles to possess a spherical morphology with an average diameter of around 7 nanometers and the average size of nanoparticles by DLS is 85.27 ± 0.26 nm with a PDI of 0.25. The BSA coating improved drug loading to 27.5% and resulted in a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on 4T1 tumor cells. Specifically, a release of 62% of the loaded quercetin was observed at pH 5.7 after 120 hours, compared to only 41% at pH 7.4. The in vitro assessment also demonstrated high biocompatibility, with less than 5% hemolysis observed at concentrations up to 200 μg mL−1. In vivo studies show no mouse death in the test of LD50. Overall, these findings support the potential of BSA-coated MnFe2O4 nanoparticles as a promising drug delivery platform to enhance quercetin's stability and bioavailability for effective tumor growth inhibition. © 2025 RSC.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002408623,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Upon exposure to Hg2+, the LC droplets undergo a distinct orientational transition from radial (homeotropic) to bipolar (planar), which can be clearly visualized using polarized optical microscopy (POM). This response is attributed to the strong interaction between mercury ions and the amine groups present in the PEI coating. The sensor exhibits a rapid response time of approximately 10 s at a mercury ion concentration as low as 59 mM. The limit of detection (LOD) in distilled water is determined to be 4.71 mM using a sample volume of 160 μL. The sensitivity of the system is influenced by parameters such as the concentration and volume of the mercury ion solution and the number of LC droplets used. Furthermore, the sensor demonstrates reliable detection of Hg2+ in various water samples, including distilled and lake water, indicating its practical applicability.

Initially, BHS exhibits intense whitish blue fluorescence due to the active excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) mechanism within the molecule. However, upon interaction with Cu2+ and OCl−, noticeable changes in absorption and fluorescence occur, attributed to the inhibition of ESIPT resulting from analyte binding with BHS, leading to spirolactam ring opening. Furthermore, significant Stokes shifts in absorption (Δλ = 34 nm and 170 nm for Cu2+, and 163 nm for OCl−) and emission (Δλ = 67 nm for both Cu2+ and OCl−) further confirm this transformation. The spirolactam ring opening is induced by Cu2+ coordination, whereas for OCl−, it is triggered by oxidative cleavage. To explore potential biological applications, fluorescence titration experiments were conducted to study the interactions of the BHS-Cu2+ complex with ct-DNA and the transport protein bovine serum albumin (BSA). Additionally, molecular docking studies were performed to assess these interactions, while DFT calculations were employed to optimize the structures of BHS and its Cu2+ complex.

In this study, a fluorescence-based approach was developed for the ratiometric detection of vitamin B6 pyridoxal (PY) using blue-emitting lysine-gold nanoclusters (Lys-AuNCs, λem = 420 nm) and doxorubicin (DOX, λem = 590 nm) as a fluorescent indicator. With the addition of DOX to the Lys-AuNCs, nano-assembly DOX-Lys-AuNCs formed via electrostatic attraction, and the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the Lys-AuNCs (donor) to DOX (acceptor) caused fluorescence quenching at 420 nm. With the addition of PY to the nano-assembly DOX-Lys-AuNCs, PY is post-functionalized over the surface of Lys-AuNCs by forming Schiff base with the functionalized lysine, which displaced DOX and inhibited the FRET process. The blue emission of Lys-AuNCs was restored and red-shifted from 420 nm to 445 nm, whereas the DOX emission was quenched at 590 nm. With an estimated detection limit of 3.25 μM, the nano-assembly DOX-Lys-AuNCs was successfully employed to quantify PY in food samples.

In this study, the photochemical behavior of the experimental anticancer ligand di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) and its chelate complexes with copper(ii) and zinc(ii) ions were investigated using laser flash photolysis (LFP), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) with spin traps, chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP), and high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) techniques. MTT assay demonstrated a reduction in cell viability when cells were irradiated in the presence of Dp44mT and its complexes with Cu(ii). LFP analysis revealed the formation of transient absorption upon excitation of Dp44mT solutions by UVA light (355 nm). This absorption featured an intense band peaking at ∼400 nm and a broad, structureless absorption in the visible region. The intermediate absorption spectra of the Dp44mT complexes with Cu(ii) and Zn(ii) ions were characterized by the absence of an intense intermediate absorption band near 400 nm. The spectra and lifetime of this intermediate were independent of the presence of oxygen, indicating the absence of the singlet oxygen generation. CIDNP experiments showed that the photoreaction of Dp44mT with model electron acceptors, such as quinones, proceeds via proton-coupled electron transfer, leading to the formation of an S-centered neutral radical. It was found that complex formation of Dp44mT with zinc and copper ions stabilizes the thiosemicarbazone, which leads to inhibition of the formation of free radical species and increase Dp44mT photostability. Dp44mT and its chelate complexes did not exhibit electron acceptor properties in reaction with the amino acid derivative N-acetyl-l-tryptophan. EPR experiments with the TMIO spin trap showed the redox activity of the Dp44mT chelate complex with Cu(ii) ions in the Fenton reaction under UV-A light (366 nm), which are correlated with its photocytotoxicity. Chromatography-mass spectrometry data were used to propose a photoconversion pathway for Dp44mT and identify its primary photodegradation products. The Dp44mT photocytotoxicity is probably explained by the toxicity of secondary products formed during the photodegradation of Dp44mT. These results provide insight into the possible photodegradation pathways of Dp44mT, highlighting the role of photodegradation products in its biological activity. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012990995,Semicarbazone

Using luminescent nanomaterials as labels can significantly improve immunoassay performance, especially in terms of sensitivity. Lanthanide-doped photon-upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are nanocrystals capable of converting near-infrared radiation into visible light, and their emission spectra can be tuned by altering the dopant ions. In this study, the bioconjugation between UCNPs and biomolecules was optimized, and different conjugates of Er- and Tm-doped UCNPs (NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+) were prepared for detecting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and tumor protein p53, comparing heterogeneous and homogeneous assay formats. The heterogeneous sandwich immunoassay achieved detection limits of 1.3 pg mL−1 for PSA and 330 pg mL−1 for p53.

However, their excited-state dynamics, particularly long-lived emission, remain a subject of debate. In this work, we investigated the excited state dynamics of bovine serum albumin (BSA) functionalized Ag and Au nanoclusters (BSA-Ag NCs and BSA-Au NCs) and provided new insights into their long-lived emission. The decay dynamics of excited-state nanoclusters showed distinct photoluminescence behavior influenced by the specific metal core in the BSA-MNCs. BSA-Au NCs showed short-lived emission followed by a long-lived excited state at room temperature, originating from the core-surface state interactions. These interactions facilitate ligand-to-metal charge transfer states, which enable efficient triplet-state harvesting at room temperature. BSA-Ag NCs, on the other hand, exhibit short-lived emission originating only from the core states, resulting in fluorescence as the relaxation pathway at room temperature, which transitioned to phosphorescence with sub-millisecond lifetimes under cryogenic conditions.

A novel approach to utilize exogenous surfactant preparation as a drug delivery vehicle for corticosteroids, which are the inflammation-reducing agents for lung diseases has not been comprehensively investigated. The direct corticosteroid drugs administered through pulmonary surfactants would impair their surface activity and exacerbate normal breathing cycles. This study was conducted to characterize the physiological interaction between frequently used inhaled corticosteroid, mometasone furoate, and relevant composition of lung surfactants by using the in vitro and in silico methods. The major objective of this work is to elucidate the effects of glucocorticoids on the structural and dynamical characteristics of the lung surfactant as well as the effects of the drug on the ability of the surfactant monolayer to reduce surface tension during mechanical breathing. Our results from the Langmuir experiment and atomic force microscopy imply that mometasone furoate concentrations less than 4.18% w/w might not strongly influence the physicochemical characteristics of the surfactant molecules representing the feasible concentration for pulmonary drug delivery. Beyond this range, mometasone furoate concentrations cause intensified film fluidization that leads the surfactant film to collapse at lower surface pressure, which is also verified by the in silico study. The failure of the drug to permeate into the lipid bilayer is most likely what causes this collapse. On the other hand, for inhalation breathing, the monolayer forms pores induced by the high drug concentrations. Our investigation also reveals that mometasone furoate exhibits different spreading behaviors because of their affinities to the surfactant molecules. This work may have implications for the use of inhaled steroids in the treatment of asthma in addition to its translational significance in the management of chronic lung disease. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219234760,Mometasone furoate

TA-Fe3+ complex via coordination interactions formed a thin layer on the surface of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and then poly(ethylenimine)-g-sulfobetaine methacrylate (PEI-g-SBMA) underwent a Schiff-base reaction with the TA layer, allowing the zwitterionic copolymer to be anchored onto the PET surface. Elemental and morphological surface analyses successfully confirmed the deposition of TA-Fe3+ complex and PEI-g-SBMA onto the surfaces. Water contact angle and friction coefficient tests indicated an improvement in the hydrophilic and lubricating properties of the surface after modification. Importantly, the modified surfaces exhibited a significant reduction in the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA), demonstrating the excellent antifouling ability. Hemolysis tests were also conducted to assess the hemocompatibility of the coatings. The results indicated that lubricative and antifouling coatings can be easily prepared on medical material surfaces using the approach, which showed significant potential for applications in biomedical fields. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000161114,Biofouling; Tannic acid

Inhibition of dual targets including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) represents a promising strategy to address cholinergic deficits and amyloid pathology. In this study, we used computational approaches to evaluate 8000 tripeptides as potential dual inhibitors of AChE and BACE-1. Machine learning models revealed the four top-lead tripeptides including WHM, HMW, WMH, and HWM. Molecular docking simulations indicated that WHM possessed the most favorable interactions through hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, and salt bridges with key catalytic residues in both enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of the protein-ligand complexes, with WHM exhibiting the most consistent conformations and significant disruption of catalytic residue geometries. Free energy perturbation analysis further supported WHM's superior stability across both targets. ADMET predictions suggested moderate oral absorption and limited brain penetration, consistent with the typical behavior of peptide-based compounds. Overall, WHM demonstrated the strongest potential as a dual inhibitor of AChE and BACE-1, offering a promising lead for future therapeutic development in AD. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003431663,Tripeptide

This study explores the development of ultrasmall, water-soluble copper-glutathione (Cu-SG) nanoclusters, focusing on their catalytic capacity for the degradation of p-nitrophenol (p-NP), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-like activity, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detection. During synthesis, a combination of one-pot synthesis and acid-etching strategy was employed. The acid-etching approach was specifically utilized as an essential method to precisely regulate the structural properties of the clusters. The water-soluble ultrasmall Cu-SG nanoclusters show superior catalytic efficiency, achieving 98% conversion of p-NP to p-aminophenol (p-AP) within six minutes. The reaction followed first-order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.44 min−1, consistent with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. Notably, the Cu-SG retained catalytic efficiency across multiple reaction cycles, highlighting their recyclability and long-term stability. Additionally, Cu-SG exhibited excellent sensitivity and selectivity for rapid colorimetric H2O2 detection due to the strong HRP-like activity, achieving a detection limit of 6.03 μM with high resistance to interference from other ions and compounds. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrates an enthalpy driven spontaneous reduction of p-NP with Cu-SG, wherein the van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions are predominant. By contrast, the interaction of Cu-SG with H2O2 is an entropy-driven, spontaneous process, and the dominating hydrophobic forces drive the HRP-like catalytic mechanism. This study demonstrates the potential of the Cu-SG as an efficient, stable, and recyclable water-soluble copper nanocatalyst for pollutant degradation and as a sensitive sensor for reactive species. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000672204,4-Nitrophenol; Degradation; Horseradish peroxidase; Nitrophenol

These green solvents have been widely used in synthesis, catalysis and biocatalysis, nanoscience, pharmaceutics, etc. Hence, it is exciting to see how ionic liquids behave within deep eutectic solvents. Here, we examined the aggregation behavior of an imidazolium-based surface-active ionic liquid (SAIL), 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [Dmim][BF4], within aqueous solution of 5 wt% DES choline-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs). Two choline-based DESs (ChCl-urea and ChCl-Gly) were prepared by heating a mixture of 1 : 2 molar ratios of an ammonium salt (choline chloride) with hydrogen bond donors (urea and glycerol). The DESs were characterized using FTIR and 1H-NMR spectroscopic techniques. Micellization behavior of the SAIL [Dmim][BF4] within these aqueous DESs media was investigated using fluorescence, FTIR, dynamic light scattering (DLS), 1H-NMR, and NOESY. The information about the local microenvironment surrounding the probe molecules and size of the aggregates of [Dmim][BF4] in the presence of 5 wt% of aqueous DESs were obtained from fluorescence and DLS, respectively. DLS results showed that IL [Dmim][BF4] forms relatively larger micelles within aqueous solutions of DES ChCl-urea (avg. hydrodynamic radii = 94.6 nm) compared with ChCl-Gly (avg. hydrodynamic radii = 82.8 nm). A significant decrease in the critical micellar concentration and an increase in aggregation number (Nagg) were observed, clearly indicating that micellization of IL [Dmim][BF4] is greatly favored in the DES solutions. FTIR study depicts the strength of intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ion-ion pair interactions, and dipole-dipole interactions between the ILs and DESs. The 1H-NMR data showed that differences in chemical shifts can provide significant indication about the IL-DES interactions. 1H-NMR and 1H-1H 2D NOESY spectroscopy were employed to gain insights into these IL-DES interactions that are responsible for the aggregation behavior of the IL [Dmim][BF4] within aqueous DES solutions. It was observed that IL [Dmim][BF4] forms self-assembled structures within the aqueous DESs media. The current results are expected to be useful for colloidal aspects of ILs and DESs and their mixtures with water. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005280715,Deep eutectic solvent

In this study, we developed and optimized core/shell molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (CS-MI-NPs) tailored for quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) sensors. The nanoparticles were synthesized through a controlled sol-gel process, achieving tunable sizes (22-63 nm) and high monomer conversion. Functionalization with amine and vinyl groups facilitated imprinting of a selective shell, enhancing the recognition capabilities of CS-MI-NPs. The optimized system demonstrated significantly improved binding performance, with a specific surface area increase of 260-270% and a target protein retention rate of 34-37%, compared to 6-12% in non-imprinted controls. Langmuir modeling confirmed high affinity and selective binding sites, while QCM-D measurements validated efficient immobilization, low nonspecific interactions, and a detection limit of 2.8 nM for streptavidin. Additionally, CS-MI-NPs selectively recognized tannins in complex mixtures, distinguishing between proanthocyanidins, ellagic, and gallic tannins, with detection levels comparable to biologically derived probes.

This study investigates solvent polarity effects on the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum, and thermodynamic and electronic properties of metronidazole via semiempirical, Hartree-Fock (HF), and density functional theory (DFT) methods. Its binding with antibacterial drugs was also investigated via molecular docking. The results showed that in water, the dipole moment and polarizability increased, indicating enhanced solubility and reactivity. Solvent-induced changes in bond lengths and angles are important for understanding the behavior of metronidazole in biological systems. FTIR reveals changes in molecular interactions due to solvation effects, especially hydrogen bonding in water. Thermodynamic calculations further revealed that polar solvents increase the energy and dipole moment, enhancing the reactivity of the molecule. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis indicated that the molecules are more stable in polar environments, while UV-Vis spectral shifts showed that the solvent affects the electronic properties. Molecular docking studies with antibacterial proteins revealed that metronidazole binds strongly to proteins, with the metronidazole-4kov complex showing the highest binding affinity. Molecular docking of metronidazole with secnidazole, tizoxanide, and caffeine enhances the binding affinities, suggesting synergistic effects.

Accurate measurement is essential for ensuring therapeutic efficacy, enabling personalized treatment, and preventing adverse effects. Given the variability in patient metabolism and excretion, regular monitoring helps maintain CMB levels within the therapeutic range, improving treatment outcomes and minimizing the risk of drug resistance. This work presents an economical and energy-efficient strategy for preparing highly luminescent nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs), employing 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone alongside triethylenetetramine. The synthesized NCDs demonstrated excellent photostability and a high fluorescence quantum yield of 38.72%. Upon the addition of CMB, concentration-dependent fluorescence quenching was observed at 515 nm, which was attributed to the inner filter effect (IFE), with LOD of 3.6 nM. The NCDs exhibited high selectivity in detecting CMB, with minimal cross-reactivity from simultaneously present compounds. Recovery studies in real biological samples yielded rates between 97.4% and 105.3%, and RSDs were consistently below 4.11%.

This combination of data depth and quantity creates the opportunity to unite advanced data science approaches, such as Machine Learning (ML), with 2D-IR to reveal insights that surpass those from established data interpretation methods. To demonstrate this, we show that ML and 2D-IR spectroscopy can classify blood serum samples collected from patients with melanoma according to diagnostically-relevant groupings. Using just 20 μL samples, 2D-IR measures ‘protein amide I fingerprints’, which reflect the protein profile of blood serum. A hyphenated Partial Least Squares-Support Vector Machine (PLS-SVM) model was able to classify 2D-protein fingerprints taken from 40 patients with melanoma according to the presence, absence or later development of metastatic disease. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.75 and 0.86 were obtained when identifying samples from patients who were radiologically cancer free and with metastatic disease respectively. The model was also able to classify (AUROC = 0.80) samples from a third group of patients who were radiologically cancer-free at the point of testing but would go on to develop metastatic disease within five years. This ability to identify post-treatment patients at higher risk of relapse from a spectroscopic measurement of biofluid protein content shows the potential for hybrid 2D-IR-ML analyses and raises the prospect of a new route to an optical blood-based test capable of risk stratification for melanoma patients. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003061911,Risk Stratification; Stratification (seeds)

Since these MMR proteins are highly interdependent, simultaneous detection of these proteins rather than separate detection in cancer is vital to accurately distinguish the MSI phenotypes. In this study, we fabricated four orthogonal gap-enhanced Raman tag (O-GERT) flavors with high sensitivity, superb photostability, and completely separated interference-free signal readouts. With antibody functionalization, these multicolored O-GERTs allowed one-shot detection of these four MMR proteins in cancer tissues with high specificity and spectral resolution. Based on quantitative Raman imaging, these cancer tissues were classified into microsatellite stable (MSS) or high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) subtypes. The detected MSI-H ratios for colorectal, breast and gastric cancers were 13.3%, 6.7% and 3.3%, respectively. Moreover, the correlation between the expression levels of these MMR proteins in colorectal cancer and related clinicopathologic parameters in these subtypes was established for the first time. We further demonstrated that MSI in cancer can serve as a tool for screening Lynch syndrome (a genetic disorder) and predicting potential candidates for immunotherapy by PD1/PD-L1 blockade. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of quantitative multiplexed Raman imaging for fast detection of MSI in cancer. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008681877,Microsatellite Instability

However, its short half-life, poor water-solubility, and low stability in vivo hinder its use. The development of injectable controlled release systems for ATRA delivery can potentially address these challenges. Building on a poly(caprolactone-co-lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(caprolactone-co-lactide) (PCLA-PEG-PCLA) triblock copolymer system that undergoes thermo-responsive gelation at 37 °C, we explore and compare different approaches to stabilize the gels through covalent bonding. The attempted cross-linking of methacrylate end-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA through thiol-Michael addition reactions using small molecule and 4-arm-PEG thiols led to precipitation rather than gelation. However, azide end-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA was gelled using 5 kg mol−1 4-arm-PEG with terminal dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBAC) groups by strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition. This hydrogel was then compared with previously reported methacrylate end-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA hydrogels cross-linked by free radical chemistry, as well as non-covalently cross-linked hydrogels. The azide-alkyne hydrogels exhibited properties intermediate between the free radical and non-covalently cross-linked gels. Incorporation of ATRA substantially disrupted the free radical cross-linking, but imparted only modest changes in the azide-alkyne gels. ATRA was released over about two weeks.

Here we evaluate plasmonic gold nanocapsules (AuNCs) as photoresponsive agents for two-photon luminescence-assisted photothermal therapy in chemoresistant melanoma models. The performance of the AuNCs was assessed in two-dimensional cell cultures, three-dimensional paclitaxel-resistant B16-F10 melanoma spheroids, and a subcutaneous melanoma mouse model under near-infrared excitation. In vitro, AuNCs alone exhibited no cytotoxicity, but under 830 nm two-photon excitation, they produced strong two-photon luminescence and thermal effects that increased with nanocapsule concentration and laser power. This led to transient oxidative stress, apoptosis induction, and effective melanoma cell ablation under optimal conditions (80 μg mL−1 AuNCs, 12 mW laser power). In vivo, the route of nanoparticle administration proved decisive. A single 4-min 806 nm irradiation after intratumoral injection uniformly heated the lesion (≈45-50 °C), yielded durable tumour eradication, and sequestered >99% of detected gold in the necrotic scab, with only trace renal clearance. In contrast, the same laser fluence after peritumoral injection generated a superficial hot rim, spared the tumour core, allowing eventual regrowth, and left ∼65% of the injected gold systemically redistributed, mainly in the spleen and liver. These findings highlight the potential of AuNCs as potent, image-guided photothermal agents for chemoresistant melanoma, offering targeted tumor destruction with limited systemic exposure.

In its open conformation, TG2 exhibits transamidase activity linked to fibrosis, arterial remodeling, and endothelial dysfunction, a process enhanced by high glucose in endothelial cells. However, the closed conformation of TG2 contributes to transmembrane signaling and nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasorelaxation. LDN 27219, a reversible allosteric inhibitor, stabilizes TG2 in its closed conformation. We examined whether pharmacological modulation of TG2 into its closed conformation induces vasorelaxation and enhances endothelium-dependent and independent relaxation in resistance arteries from age-matched diabetic (n = 14) and non-diabetic patients (n = 14) (age 71 (Standard Error of the Mean: ± 2)). Subcutaneous arteries (diameter 133–1013 µm) were isolated from abdominal fat biopsies. TG2 mRNA expression and transamidase activity were assessed via RT-qPCR and 5-biotin(amido)pentylamine (5-BP) incorporation, while vascular reactivity was measured using wire myography. TG2 mRNA was highly expressed without significant differences between the groups and LDN 27219 induced concentration-dependent vasorelaxation in arteries from both groups. Sex-specific analysis revealed that potentiation of acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation by LDN 27219 was driven by increased TG2 expression in non-diabetic females, whereas no effect was observed in arteries from non-diabetic males. Among diabetic patients, LDN 27219 increased maximal acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation in males only. LDN 27219 did not affect endothelium-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside in either group. In conclusion, TG2 is expressed in human resistance arteries, and LDN 27219 induced vasorelaxation, selectively enhancing ACh relaxation in non-diabetic females, likely owing to increased TG2 expression. This finding underscores the importance of sex differences in TG2 modulation of vasorelaxation. © 2025 Portland Press Ltd.

C-SFK was induced by fetal UNX at 100 days gestation (term=150 days) in male sheep fetuses, and a sham procedure was performed. At approximately one month of age, EA-SFK was induced by UNX in male lambs. At eight months of age, total kidney weight was similar in all groups due to marked hypertrophy in the C-SFK and EA-SFK groups. Blood pressure was similar in EA-SFK and sham groups but ~12 mmHg higher in the C-SFK group compared with sham. Compared with the sham group, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was ~9% less in the EA-SFK group and ~26% less in the C-SFK. GFR was ~23% higher in EA-SFK compared with the C-SFK group.

However, like the C-SFK group, the renal blood flow response to nitric oxide blockade was attenuated in the EA-SFK group compared with sham.

Whole blood was heat-challenged weekly at 42 °C for 1–2 hours over 22 weeks, and ΔHSP70 was calculated as the difference between HSP70 expressions at 42 °C and 37 °C. Results correlated with fasting glycaemia, oral glucose tolerance test, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test and 2-hour post-glucose load glycaemia. ΔHSP70 levels >0.2250 indicated normal fasting glycaemia, while levels <0.2125 signalled insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes onset. A logistic model (five-parameter logistic) showed progressive HSR decline, with HFD mice exhibiting earlier ΔHSP70 reduction (t1/2 = 3.14 weeks) compared with NC mice (t1/2 = 8.24 weeks), highlighting compromised anti-inflammatory capacity in both groups of mice maintained at TNZ. Remarkably, even NC mice surpassed insulin resistance thresholds by week 22, relevant as control diets confronted interventions. Observed HSR decline mirrors tissue-level suppression in obese and type-2 diabetic individuals, underscoring HSR failure as a hallmark of obesity-driven inflammation. This study introduces a practical whole-blood assay to evaluate HSR suppression, allowing assessment of glycaemic status during obesity onset before any clinical manifestation. © 2025 The Author(s); published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216891178,Ex vivo

Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug. METHODS In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for 2 additional years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death as assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period. RESULTS Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group and 40% in the placebo group). During the combined active- and post-trial periods, a primary-outcome event occurred in 865 of 3304 patients (26.2%) in the empagliflozin group and in 1001 of 3305 patients (30.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.87). During the post-trial period only, the hazard ratio for a primary-outcome event was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99). During the combined periods, the risk of kidney disease progression was 23.5% in the empagliflozin group and 27.1% in the placebo group; the risk of the composite of death or end-stage kidney disease was 16.9% and 19.6%, respectively; and the risk of cardiovascular death was 3.8% and 4.9%, respectively. There was no effect of empagliflozin on death from noncardiovascular causes (5.3% in both groups). CONCLUSIONS In a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease at risk for progression, empagliflozin continued to have additional cardiorenal benefits for up to 12 months after it was discontinued.

The results presented are appropriate for a sensing medium (water) with a refractive index of 1.33 and small changes due to an added analyte. The maximum sensitivity of the proposed structure is found to be 580 (degree/refractive index unit) for a wavelength of 633 nm.

Developing in vitro models of this key tissue is of great importance to enhancing physiological relevance in immunoengineering. The LN consists of stromal populations and immune cells, which are highly organized and bathed in constant interstitial fluid flow (IFF). The stroma, notably the fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) and the lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), play crucial roles in guiding T cell migration and are known to be sensitive to fluid flow. During inflammation, interstitial fluid flow rates drastically increase in the LN. It is unknown how these altered flow rates impact crosstalk and cell behavior in the LN, and most existing in vitro models focus on the interactions between T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells rather than with the stroma. To address this gap, we developed a human engineered model of the LN stroma consisting of FRC-laden hydrogel above a monolayer of LECs in a tissue culture insert with gravity-driven interstitial flow. We found that FRCs had enhanced coverage and proliferation in response to high flow rates, while LECs experienced decreased barrier integrity. We added CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and found that their egress was significantly decreased in the presence of interstitial flow, regardless of magnitude. Interestingly, 3.0 μm/s flow, but not 0.8 μm/s flow, correlated with enhanced inflammatory cytokine secretion in the LN stroma. Overall, we demonstrate that interstitial flow is an essential consideration in the lymph node for modulating LN stroma morphology, T cell migration, and inflammation. © 2025 Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002279230,Interstitial fluid; Interstitial space; Reticular cell

Nevertheless, the problem of wind turbine blade downtime due to icing, which occurs in the fall and winter seasons under conditions of high humidity and low temperature, remains an urgent problem that must be addressed. In addressing this challenge, a novel method of pulsed liquid discharge shock wave de-icing has been proposed, offering distinct advantages such as reduced energy consumption and expedited response times. Ensuring that the liquid phase medium remains in the liquid state under low-temperature conditions is paramount to facilitating the smooth generation of shock waves during liquid phase discharge. Consequently, the selection of an appropriate antifreeze becomes pivotal for the successful implementation of this technology. However, it was found in this paper that pulsed discharge in ethylene glycol antifreeze (C2H6O2 + H2O) would generate significant amounts of gaseous products, altering the medium's environment and impacting subsequent discharges and shock wave generation. The gaseous products and liquid residues of ethylene glycol antifreeze after pulsed discharge were measured and analyzed by combining mass spectrometry and chromatography to determine the main product compositions of ethylene glycol antifreeze after pulsed discharge and to deeply analyze the decomposition paths of ethylene glycol antifreeze under pulsed discharge conditions. This study is expected to enhance the comprehension of the chemical process of pulsed liquid discharge in typical organic antifreeze, thereby providing significant theoretical guidance and practical reference for the selection of antifreeze in the subsequent pulsed liquid discharge shock wave de-icing method. © 2025 Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003322537,Antifreeze

Especially the protein and fluid interactions with the nitrocellulose membrane structure are yet to be fully investigated, which affect the fluid and protein distribution of the test and control lines differently due to different adsorptive properties of fluids and proteins. Therefore, the relationship between fluid spread and protein distribution, respectively, and structure needs systematic evaluation. Two procedures were developed based on passive adsorption of complementary fluorescent dyes to investigate these phenomena. These procedures enabled three-dimensional visualization of the membrane structure, fluid as well as the protein spreading, respectively. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was applied after depositing picoliter and nanoliter volumes of the printing buffers containing fluorophore-labeled proteins (immunoglobulin G) and Oregon Green™ 488 onto the membrane using a high precision micro dispenser. The resulting data were correlated with the membrane's tortuosity and permeability. Inverse-proportional dependencies for the lateral spread of the fluid and protein adsorption with the structural parameters were observed. Additionally, surfactants [polysorbate 80 (PS80) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), both at 0.1%] were added individually to the buffers, and the spread of the liquids was evaluated. Both surfactants increase the similarities between fluid and protein shape compared to the reference data. While SDBS increases the general lateral spread, PS80 does increase the penetration depth of the protein into the membrane, which could lead to reduced signal in LFAs. © 2025 Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000033880,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Inspired by TARE, we study the injection of fluid via a catheter in an idealized liver vasculature through experiments and lattice Boltzmann simulations. First, we validate the simulations using in vitro experiments of dye injected through a catheter. Then, we investigate the impact of catheter injection velocity on the distribution of injected fluid. The sensitivity of the distributions to changes in flow rate is low at catheter flow rates Q c ≤ 6 mL min − 1 and Q c ≥ 11 mL min − 1 , while in the intermediate regime, changes in flow rate of only 2 ml/min lead to changes in distribution of more than 50%. This is shown to originate from changes in the flow field in the first bifurcation. Specifically, the sensitivity to flow rate becomes large as the jet breakdown length approaches the distance to the first bifurcation. Our work represents a first step toward a fundamental understanding of the effect of injection velocity in TARE and similar applications. © 2025 Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002733636,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

To address inequities and optimise care, Te Korowai Hauora o Hauraki, an Iwi Māori health provider, established the 'Piki te Ora service' to support its five rural clinics by providing culturally safe, multidisciplinary support for patients with T2D. Aim This study aimed to undertake a service review, describing and evaluating the available clinical data, of the Piki te Ora service. Methods Patients enrolled in the Piki te Ora service between January 2021 and March 2024 were invited to have their data (sociodemographic, HbA1c, cholesterol and blood pressure) included in the review. Frequency and mode of health care/patient contact were also explored. Results A total of 112 patients were contacted and 64 (mean age 58years, 62.5% Māori) consented to data review. Over 6months, patients in the Piki te Ora service were contacted an average of 9.5 times, with phone calls being the predominant mode of contact. Median HbA1c levels significantly decreased by 16.0mmol/mol at 6months post enrolment in the Piki te Ora service (P =0.011) but no significant changes were observed in cholesterol or blood pressure.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of all relevant information was conducted for patients who underwent total thyroidectomy with neck lymph node dissection at our hospital between April 2021 and September 2022. The primary outcome measure was symptomatic hypocalcemia. Results: Of the 210 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy with l neck lymph node dissection, 76 patients (36%) experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia. The analysis confirmed that the rate of parathyroid hormone (PTH) decline (OR = 238.414, 95%CI: 51.904–1095.114, P = 0.000) was an independent risk factor for symptomatic hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy with neck lymph node dissection. The ROC curve indicated that a PTH decline cutoff value of 0.7425 was significantly correlated with symptoms of hypocalcemia, with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 69%, which could effectively predict symptomatic hypocalcemia. Conclusion: A PTH decline rate greater than the cutoff value of 0.7425 is a predictive factor for symptomatic hypocalcemia in adults and may be considered as a high-risk patient and actively managed to supplement calcium as soon as possible to ensure patient safety. © 2024 The Author(s).

Accurate prognostic evaluation is essential in CRC patient management. This study investigates the prognostic significance of red blood cell count (RBC) and Onodera’s prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) in resectable CRC patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 210 CRC patients undergoing radical resection (January 2015–January 2017) assessed clinical and hematological factors, including RBC, albumin, hemoglobin, and OPNI. A novel comprehensive biomarker, R-OPNI, combining preoperative RBC with OPNI, was introduced. Correlations with patient survival were analyzed, and R-OPNI’s independent prognostic value was assessed through univariate and multivariate Cox models. Predictive ability was compared to other factors using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method. Results: Higher RBC levels (≥ 3.9 × 1012/L) and elevated OPNI were associated with significantly improved overall survival. Lower R-OPNI scores (0 or 1) indicated notably poorer survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed R-OPNI’s independent prognostic significance (HR: 0.273, 95% CI: 0.098–0.763, p = 0.013). R-OPNI (AUC = 0.732) demonstrated superior predictive value compared to individual prognostic factors. Conclusion: R-OPNI emerges as a robust, independent prognostic predictor for resectable CRC patients, emphasizing the importance of assessing preoperative nutritional status. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206112738,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Based on case series and small hospital-based studies, a number of drugs have been associated with BP. More reliable and precise estimates of associations between a broad selection of drugs/vaccines and BP will enable greater awareness of any potential increased risk of BP following the administration of certain medicines and help identify clinical, histological and genomic characteristics of drug-induced BP for different culprit drugs. Greater awareness could lead to earlier recognition or suspicion of BP and referral to a dermatologist for diagnosis. Earlier diagnosis may lead to less aggressive treatment and improved wellbeing. Objectives: To determine the association between drugs/vaccines commonly prescribed to older people and the risk of developing BP. Methods: We conducted a population-based nested case-control study between 1998 and 2021 using electronic primary care records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We matched patients with BP with up to five controls. Exposures were drugs/vaccines commonly prescribed to older people. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression adjusting for multiple drug use. For antibiotics, in a sensitivity analysis, we considered that drugs may be prescribed for undiagnosed symptoms of BP that resemble skin infection (protopathic bias). Results: Antibiotics were associated with the highest risk of BP [odds ratio (OR) 4.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.40-4.80]. However, after adjusting for protopathic bias, the OR decreased to 2.08 (95% CI 1.99-2.17). Also, after adjusting for protopathic bias, of all the antibiotic classes and subclasses, penicillins [OR 3.44, 95% CI 3.29-3.60 (sensitivity analysis OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.66-1.84)] and penicillinase-resistant penicillins [OR 7.56, 95% CI 7.15-8.00 (sensitivity analysis OR 2.64, 95% CI 2.45-2.85)] had the strongest associations with BP risk. Other drugs strongly associated with increased risk were gliptins (OR 2.77, 95% CI 2.37-3.23) and second-generation antipsychotics (OR 2.58, 95% CI 2.20-3.03). Conclusions: Healthcare professionals need to be aware of BP risk in older people, particularly when prescribing penicillinase-resistant penicillins, gliptins and second-generation antipsychotic drugs, to recognize and manage BP early. Owing to the low disease prevalence, we do not suggest avoiding certain drugs/vaccines to prevent BP. Further research should consider recency, dosage and duration of antibiotic treatments.  © 2024 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218805545,Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis

The primary outcome was the short-term postoperative complication rate. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the significant predictors of severe mediastinal shift and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plots were drawn. Results: Among the 348 patients, 174 patients were assigned to the completely tubeless group and 174 patients were assigned to the partially tubeless group. There was no difference in postoperative complications including pulmonary complications, supraventricular arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, acute cerebral stroke, venous thromboembolism and urinary retention. The completely tubeless protocol was associated with a higher proportion of early mobilization (66.7% versus 55.7%, P = 0.047), a shorter median duration of drainage (1.0 versus 2.0 days, P = 0.002), and a shorter median duration of postoperative hospital stay (2.0 versus 3.0 days, P = 0.001). The completely tubeless group had less of a difference in white blood cell count before and after the operation (P = 0.042). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that weight was a significant predictor of mediastinal shift in the completely tubeless group. Conclusion: Under enhanced recovery after surgery protocols, there is no difference in postoperative complications in patients undergoing completely or partially tubeless surgery. However, patients having completely tubeless surgery have shorter durations of postoperative drainage, shorter durations of hospital stay, milder systemic inflammatory reactions, and better immune protection than patients who undergo lung resection with a partially tubeless protocol. The severity of mediastinal shift may be mainly related to body-weight. © The Author(s) 2025.

This study aimed to determine the role of aggressive intravenous hydration with lactated Ringer’s solution at a specific volume with 20% human albumin before ERCP in reducing the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Methods: This study was a single-centre randomized clinical trial. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: those who received aggressive intravenous hydration with 20% human albumin and lactated Ringer's solution (intervention group), and those who received standard-volume intravenous hydration with lactated Ringer's solution (control group). The primary endpoint was post-ERCP pancreatitis. Participants and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Comparison was performed using the chi-square, the Fisher’s exact, the Student’s t, or the Mann–Whitney U tests, where appropriate. Results: Of 300 randomized participants, 149 and 144 participants from the intervention and control group were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference in the post-ERCP pancreatitis rate (n = 10; 6.7% versus n = 9; 6.3%, P = 0.873) between the intervention and control groups. High-risk procedures (that is pancreatic duct wiring, pancreatic duct injection, precut sphincterotomy, and balloon dilation of the ampulla) were significantly associated with post-ERCP pancreatitis compared with low-risk procedures (n = 15; 15% versus n = 4; 2.1%, P < 0.001). In the high-risk procedures population, the intervention and control groups had increased post-ERCP pancreatitis rates (P = 0.716). Two participants in each group developed pulmonary congestion. Conclusion: Aggressive peri-ERCP intravenous hydration with lactated Ringer's solution combined with 50 ml of 20% human albumin did not prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis. None of the subgroups presented with prophylactic effects. © The Author(s) 2025.

Sarcopenia, defined as reduced muscle strength and muscle quantity, has been seldom assessed in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. The aim of this study was to examine functional compromise in emergency laparotomy using sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and frailty parameters and evaluate impacts on functional and patient-centred outcomes. Methods: Patients aged greater than or equal to 55 years who underwent emergency laparotomy and preoperative computed tomography (CT) at two hospitals in New Zealand between February 2022 and October 2023 were included in a prospective database. Sarcopenia was measured using the SARC-F questionnaire, isokinetic dynamometry to measure hand grip strength, and skeletal muscle quantity according to CT. Myosteatosis was determined using CT and frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale. Predictors for rehabilitation, days alive and out of hospital at 90 days, and risk of not returning home were analysed using relative risk and proportional means regression. Secondary outcomes were 3- and 6-month mortality and inpatient morbidity defined using the Clavien–Dindo classification. Results: A total of 101 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy during the study interval were analysed; 21.6% of participants had sarcopenia, 34.7% had myosteatosis, and 24.8% were living with frailty. Muscle strength parameters (low grip strength and a positive SARC-F questionnaire) had significant relationships with primary outcomes. Low grip strength (less than 27 kg for male patients and less than 16 kg for female patients) was most significant for risk of admission for rehabilitation (adjusted risk ratio 5.48 (95% c.i. 2.03 to 14.82)). A positive SARC-F questionnaire (an overall score of greater than or equal to 4 out of 10) was most significant for not returning home (adjusted risk ratio 8.26 (95% c.i. 1.81 to 37.76)). Isolated low muscle quantity (less than 52.4 cm2/m2 for male patients and less than 38.5 cm2/m2 for female patients) demonstrated no relationship. Being frail was most significant for a reduced number of days alive and out of hospital at 90 days (−13.4% compared with non-frail participants (95% c.i. −24.3% to −0.8%)). Sarcopenia and low grip strength were the only parameters to demonstrate a relationship with 3- and 6-month mortality. Conclusion: Sarcopenia and frailty parameters are major determinants of functional compromise and predict adverse outcomes after emergency laparotomy. Muscle strength is more important than mass, and measurable without imaging, streamlining its clinical application. © The Author(s) 2025.

Despite its impact on patients' quality of life, limited data exist on its epidemiology. Objectives: To estimate the incidence and prevalence of hospital-diagnosed PN and to explore the burden of associated comorbidities. Methods: A national register-based study in Denmark was conducted using data from Danish national health registers to determine the incidence and prevalence of PN diagnosed in hospitals from 1998 to 2021 and to explore the occurrence of comorbidities. Results: In total, we identified 1209 individuals diagnosed with PN. The mean age of onset was 45 years, with a female predominance of 58% (696/1209). The prevalence of PN increased over the studied period, reaching 14.1 per 100 000 individuals by 2021. Comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease had higher odds ratios preceding the diagnosis of PN, whereas the odds ratios for atopic dermatitis, mood disorders and depressive disorders increased following the onset of PN. Conclusion: The findings indicate a significant association between PN and various comorbidities, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary care. The increase in prevalence suggests a growing burden of disease. Although the study may underestimate the true prevalence of PN because of reliance on hospital records, it reveals a rising rate prevalence of PN and associated comorbidities in Denmark. The observed high prevalence of mental health problems in individuals with PN should be a focus of concern for the treating physicians.  © 2024 The Author(s).

It remains unclear whether persisting proteinuria in ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis (AAGN) reflects damage from the initial injury or ongoing inflammation. Methods. A retrospective, single-centre study of biopsy-proven AAGN was performed. The study defined the ‘albuminuria’ group as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >300 mg/g and the ‘no albuminuria’ group as ACR ≤300 mg/g at 6 months. We sought the clinical and histopathological characteristics of both the initial and subsequent biopsies and long-term kidney outcomes stratified by albuminuria levels. Results. Two hundred and eighteen patients were included. Within the first 6 months, 28 (13%) died or progressed to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Among the remaining 190 patients, 37% had an ACR >300 mg/g at 6 months. The albuminuria group more frequently presented with a Berden mixed or crescentic class and had higher glomerular activity on the initial biopsy. They were more often male (OR 2.75; 95% CI 1.15–6.54), younger age (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93–0.99), and had fewer normal glomeruli in the biopsy (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93–0.99) compared with the group without albuminuria. Over the initial 5-year period, the recovery in eGFR was lower in the albuminuria group (adjusted mean difference in eGFR −12.5 mL/min per 1.73 m2; 95% CI −15.8 to −9.1). In multivariable analysis, ACR >300 mg/g was associated with a higher risk of ESKD, even after adjusting for Berden classification and eGFR at diagnosis (hazard ratio 6.53; 95% CI 1.49–28.50). Conclusions. In a well-defined cohort of AAGN, one-third of the patients, primarily younger males with a lower percentage of normal glomeruli, had persisting albuminuria after induction treatment which was associated with worse kidney outcomes independent of Berden class and eGFR at diagnosis. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216228367,Albuminuria
Nurmi M.S.; Pérez-Alós L.; Garred P.; Fellström B.; Gabrysch K.; Lundberg S.,"Urine complement-related proteins in IgA nephropathy and IgA vasculitis nephritis, possible biomarkers of disease activity",2025,Clinical Kidney Journal,10.1093/ckj/sfae395,"Introduction. The activation of the complement system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Our primary aim was to evaluate a range of complement-related proteins, including pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), in blood and urine at diagnosis and their association with disease activity in the kidney biopsy, eGFR, albuminuria, and outcome. Our secondary aim was to compare the same biomarkers between patients with IgAN and IgA vasculitis with renal involvement (IgAVN). Methods. In a longitudinal Swedish cohort of 96 patients with IgAN (n = 65) or IgAVN (n = 31), with a median follow-up time of 10.8 years, we analysed mainly lectin-pathway-related proteins and PTX-3 in plasma and urine (u) samples stored at the time of kidney biopsy. Outcome was defined by the GFR slope or by the combined outcome of 50% loss of eGFR or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Results. Patients with detectable vs undetectable u-PTX-3 and u-mannose-binding lectin (MBL) more frequently had mesangial hypercellularity, endocapillary proliferation, and crescents in their kidney biopsy. u-C4c levels were higher in patients with advanced tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and u-C4c was also an independent predictor of a more severe eGFR slope. There were no differences in the levels of biomarkers between patients with IgAN and IgAVN. Conclusion. u-PTX-3 and u-MBL might be biomarkers of an active proliferative stage of the disease, while higher u-C4c levels indicate more chronic lesions in both IgAN and IgAVN. These results must, however, be confirmed in larger and multiethnic cohorts. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216253370,Complement; Immunoglobulin A; Nephritis; Secretory IgA

These calculations do not account for the variation seen in preanalytical conditions in routine practice or CVI in patients presenting for treatment. As a result, the RCVs may not reflect routine practice or align with clinicians’ experiences. We propose a novel RCV approach based on routine patient data that is potentially more clinically relevant. METHODS: This study used the refineR algorithm to determine RCVs using serial patient data extracted from a local Laboratory Information System (LIS). The model was applied to biomarkers with a range of result ratio distributions varying from normal to log-normal. Results were compared against conventional formula-based RCVs using CVI estimates from a state-of-the-art biological variation study. Monte Carlo simulations were also used to validate the LIS data approach. RESULTS: The RCVs estimated from LIS data were: 11-deoxycortisol (men): −70%/+196%, 17-hydroxyproges-terone (men): −49%/+100%, albumin: −10%/+11%, androstenedione (men): −47%/+96%, cortisol (men): −54%/+51%, cortisone (men): −32%/+51%, creatinine: −16%/+14%, phosphate (women): −23%/+29%, phosphate (men): −27%/+29%, testosterone (men): −38%/+60%. The formula-based RCV estimates showed similar but slightly lower results, and the Monte Carlo simulations confirmed the applicability of the new approach. CONCLUSIONS: RCVs may be estimated from patient results without prior assumptions about the shape of the ratios between serial results. Laboratories can determine RCVs based on local practice and population. © Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214089523,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

A monocytes-based diagnostic test using perilipin-2 (PLIN2) and Ras-related protein-14 (RAB14) predict the severity of MASH and fibrosis. Here we compared the performances of PLIN2 and RAB14 with cytokeratin-18 (CK18) assessed by Ella™ or M65 ELISA in predicting MASH and fibrosis resolution following bariatric surgery in a longitudinal and histologically characterized cohort of individuals with obesity. Methods: Participants in the BRAVES randomized controlled trial underwent ultrasound-guided needle liver biopsy at baseline and 1 year after surgery. We evaluated NITs' performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic and calculated accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity based on the Youden threshold. Univariable and multivariable logistic models were used to assess the role of recorded covariates in predicting MASH and fibrosis severity, as well as resolution or improvement. Results: After surgery, patients who experienced MASH improvement or resolution showed a significant decrease in PLIN2 expression as compared to those who did not, while patients with fibrosis improvement displayed an increase in RAB14. No differences were found for CK18. The diagnostic accuracy of PLIN2 and RAB14 for the prediction of MASH resolution or fibrosis improvement was superior to CK18 assessed by either Ella or M65 ELISA. Conclusions: PLIN2 and RAB14, but not CK18, are markers for monitoring improvements in MASH and fibrosis after interventions such as bariatric surgery. This may reduce or eliminate the need for frequent liver biopsies.

Prevalence estimations are essential for public health planning and implementation of CKD treatment strategies. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and stages of CKD in the population-based Lolland-Falster Health Study, set in a rural provincial area with the lowest socioeconomic status in Denmark. Additionally, the study characterized participants with CKD, evaluated the overall disease recognition, including the awareness of CKD and compared it with other common conditions. Cross-sectional data were obtained from clinical examinations, biochemical analyses, and questionnaires. CKD was defined as albuminuria (urine albumin–creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, or by a diagnosis in the National Patient Register. Patient awareness was assessed by self-reported CKD, and overall disease recognition by either a registered hospital diagnosis or self-reported CKD. Among 16 097 adults (median age 58.6 years), CKD prevalence was 18.0% (n ¼ 2903), with 70.1% identified by albuminuria, 28.4% by reduced eGFR, and 1.5% by a registered diagnosis alone. Of those with CKD, 98.8% had stages 1–3 (eGFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m2), and 1.2% had stages 4–5 (eGFR <30 ml/ min/1.73 m2). Female sex, comorbidities, smoking, and low socioeconomic parameters were independently associated with CKD. Patient awareness of CKD was 4.4%, compared to >50% for hypertension and >80% for diabetes, and the overall CKD recognition (self-reported or registered diagnosis) was 7.1%. Thus, in this population-based study, CKD was highly prevalent but poorly recognized, indicating great potential for preventing CKD progression and related complications. © The Author(s) 2025.

Seventy-one people finalized the educational program, of whom 10 experienced major barriers to completing it. People with lower educational level required more sessions and weeks to complete it compared to those with higher educational levels. People referred due to suboptimal metabolic control and hypoglycemia also required more time to complete the process. It is essential for diabetes educators to recognize the diversity of characteristics, needs and challenges among the participants in an educational program.

Cefazolin is widely used for skin and soft tissue infections and other complex infections by IV administration. Methods: In this prospective, cross-over self-controlled study, a single dose of SC cefazolin was administered to 15 stable inpatients established on IV cefazolin as part of their management plan. The equivalent dose of cefazolin was diluted in 50 mL of normal saline via gravity feed over 30 min. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h following both the SC and IV doses. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using UPLC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic data were analysed using a non-linear mixed-effects modelling approach. Pain scores and infusion site reactions (oedema/erythema) were evaluated. Results: SC cefazolin was well tolerated. The bioavailability of SC administration was 74.8% (95% CI 66.7%–81.7%). Slower absorption from SC tissue was associated with a BMI of ≥30. Lower peak, and higher trough concentrations were observed with SC administration. Although lower bioavailability was observed with SC administration, the PTA for unbound drug concentrations greater than the MIC for more than 90% of the time between doses was higher for SC compared with IV administration at MICs between 0.25 and 4 mg/L. Simulated SC doses of 3 g twice daily had similar PTA to standard IV dosing of 2 g three times daily. A simulated 6 g continuous 24 h infusion of SC cefazolin had a favourable pharmacokinetic profile. Conclusion: SC cefazolin appears to be well tolerated, with an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared with IV administration Either 3 twice dail or 6 as a 24 h SC infusion could be considered for future evaluation © The Author(s) 2024.

Ahmed H.; Böhmdorfer M.; Jäger W.; Zeitlinger M.,Insights into interspecies protein binding variability using clindamycin as an example,2025,Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy,10.1093/jac/dkae412,"Background: In the preclinical development of new drugs, animal models are often employed to predict their efficacy in humans, relying on translational pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies. We performed in vitro experiments focusing on the comparison of plasma protein binding (PPB) and bacterial growth dynamics of clindamycin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent, across a range of drug concentrations and plasma environments. Methods: Human, bovine and rat plasma were used for determining PPB of clindamycin at various antibiotic concentrations in buffer and media containing 20% to 70% plasma or pure plasma using ultrafiltration (UF) and equilibrium dialysis (ED). Also bacterial growth and time–kill assays were performed in Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB) containing various percentages of plasma. Results: Protein binding of clindamycin correlated well between UF and ED. Notably, clindamycin exhibited substantially lower protein binding to rat plasma compared with human and bovine plasma. Staphylococcus aureus growth was significantly reduced in 70% human, bovine, and rat plasma after 4, 8 and 24 h compared with standard MHB. Time–kill data demonstrated that bacterial counts at both 20% and 70% plasmas were less when compared with MHB at drug concentrations lower than MIC after 4 and 8 h of incubation. For rat plasma, the difference was maintained over 24 h of incubation. Furthermore, a complete bacterial killing at 16 mg/L was observed after 24 h in 20% and 70% human and bovine plasma, but not for rat plasma. Conclusions: Recognizing interspecies differences in PB might be essential for optimizing the translational relevance of preclinical studies. © The Author(s) 2024.

Therefore, the pharmacodynamics of rifampicin as monotherapy and combined with polymyxin B were studied in Escherichia coli- and Klebsiella pneumoniae-infected mice. Methods: The rifampicin pharmacokinetics (oral doses 0.5–64 mg/kg) in murine plasma were studied to estimate the exposures to rifampicin. These exposures were subsequently correlated with the antibacterial effect in a sigmoid maximum-effect model. The minimum exposures needed for a static, 1 log10 and 2 log10 kill effect in two E. coli and two K. pneumoniae strains were determined for monotherapy and the combination. The pharmacodynamic interactions between polymyxin B and rifampicin were assessed using Loewe additivity and Bliss independence in both an E. coli and a K. pneumoniae strain. Results: Rifampicin monotherapy resulted in a static effect in E. coli but not against K. pneumoniae. When combined with polymyxin B, rifampicin fAUC/MIC needed for stasis, 1 log10 and 2 log10 kill effect decreased with increasing polymyxin B exposures for all strains. Synergy was confirmed in Loewe additivity (interaction indices 0.11–0.51 for E. coli and 0.04–0.19 for K. pneumoniae) and Bliss independence (267% and 863%). Maximal killing (>2 log10 kill) in combination therapy was found at rifampicin/polymyxin B fAUC/MIC of 0.68/32.56 for E. coli and 0.169/16.28 for K. pneumoniae.

Secretoneurin (SN) is a candidate biomarker, and the performance of a new high-throughput SN assay is not known. Methods: We measured SN concentrations with a prototype chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) in 299 patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea. We compared the results with a CE-marked SN enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We adjudicated the cause of dyspnea as heart failure (HF) or non-HF, and we obtained information on all-cause mortality during follow-up. Results: SN concentrations measured with CLIA and ELISA were closely correlated: rho = 0.81, P < 0.001. SN CLIA concentrations were higher in HF patients (n = 129) compared to patients with non-HF-related dyspnea (n = 170): median 51 (quartile 1-3 40-69) vs 41 (32-54) pmol/L, P < 0.001. The area under the curve (AUC) of SN CLIA to diagnose HF was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.58-0.71) and the AUC of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 0.85 (0.81-0.89). During median 818 days follow-up, 110 patients died (37%). There was a nonlinear association between SN CLIA concentrations and mortality with optimal cutpoint 53 pmol/L. SN CLIA concentrations >53 pmol/L were associated with mortality after adjusting for clinical variables and NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin T concentrations: hazard ratio 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1-2.7), AUC 0.67 (0.61-0.74). We found similar results for SN ELISA for diagnosis and prognosis with AUC 0.63 (0.57-0.70) for the prediction of mortality. Conclusion: The high-throughput SN CLIA correlates with the SN ELISA and provides independent prognostic information over established biomarkers in patients with acute dyspnea.  © 2025 Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004201800,Quartile; Troponin T; Troponin complex

Yet, studies had limitations regarding sample size, follow-up, and contemporary treatments. We evaluated the risk of T2D after BC overall, by cancer treatment, and compared with a matched cohort of cancer-free women. Methods: We assembled a population-based cohort of early-stage BC patients aged 30 years or more diagnosed during 1996-2021 in Denmark. We created a comparison cohort of 5 cancer- and T2D-free women for each BC patient, matched 6 months after BC diagnosis date on age and region. We followed both cohorts until T2D diagnosis, emigration, death, or December 31, 2022. We computed 5-year cumulative incidences and used Cox models to calculate time-varying adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of T2D. Results: Among 74 526 BC survivors and 372 630 matched cancer-free women, 5-year cumulative incidences of T2D were 3.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.7 to 3.9) and 3.3% (95% CI = 3.3 to 3.4), respectively. The aHR of T2D was elevated but attenuated over follow-up (aHR5-years = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.25, and aHR15-years = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.12). Adjuvant endocrine therapy (aHR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.19), aromatase inhibitors (aHR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.32), and less so tamoxifen (aHR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.99 to 1.11), were associated with elevated risk of T2D in women with BC vs cancer-free women. Among BC patients, chemotherapy (aHR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.17) and radiation therapy (right-sided aHR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.27 and left-sided aHR = 1.24, 95CI = 1.15 to 1.33) were associated with increased T2D risk. Conclusion: BC was associated with excess risk of T2D, although of lower magnitude than previously reported. The excess risk was temporary and related to BC treatment but could also be influenced by obesity and heightened T2D diagnostic activity. © The Author(s) 2024.

Proton therapy can be used to mitigate cardiac radiation exposure; however, proton therapy remains a scarce resource in the United States. We report on the cardiovascular profiles of patients undergoing proton therapy to determine the potential benefit of the therapy for Black women compared with patients of other races. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 599 patients with breast cancer who received proton therapy from June 2016 to December 2021 at the Maryland Proton Treatment Center. A variety of sociodemographic, disease, and treatment variables were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: With a median follow-up of 26 months (range = 0.47-90 months), Black patients made up 31.6% of the population and presented with higher rates of hypertension (P < .001), cardiopulmonary conditions (P < .001), and a higher median body mass index (P = .015) compared with the other cohort, a trend that persisted at the time of post–proton therapy follow-up. Black women had higher rates of triple-negative disease (P < .001), with subsequent greater receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P = .039). Pulmonary events were 2.6 times more likely to occur in Black patients than in the non-Black cohort after proton therapy (odds ratio = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.39 to 4.88; P = .003). Conclusions: Black women presenting for proton therapy had higher baseline risks of cardiovascular co-morbidities combined with more aggressive breast cancer biology and a subsequent 2.6-fold increased risk of pulmonary events after proton therapy. Our findings support the use of advanced radiation techniques as a means of sparing important organs at risk, especially in historically marginalized populations. © The Author(s) 2024.

Our objective was to identify blood proteins and modifiable causal risk factors for bladder cancer by combining genome-wide association study (GWAS) and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Methods: We first performed a GWAS meta-analysis of 6984 bladder cancer case patients and 708 432 control individuals from 3 European databases. Next, we conducted 2-sample MR and colocalization analyses using data from the present GWAS and published GWAS meta-analyses on plasma proteins and modifiable factors. Results: Genome-wide association study meta-analysis uncovered 17 bladder cancer susceptibility loci, of which 3 loci were novel. Genes were enriched in pathways related to the metabolic and catabolic processes of xenobiotics and cellular detoxification. Proteome-wide MR analysis based on cis-acting genetic variants revealed that higher plasma levels of glutathione S-transferases were strongly associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer. There is strong evidence of colocalization between GSTM1 and bladder cancer. Finally, multivariable MR analyses of suspected risk factors for bladder cancer revealed independent causal associations between smoking and adiposity, particularly abdominal obesity, and risk of bladder cancer. Conclusions: Findings from this large-scale GWAS and multivariable MR analyses highlight the key role of detoxification processes, particularly glutathione S-transferase 1, as well as smoking and abdominal obesity in bladder cancer etiology. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001928892,Genetic Association; Genome-wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization

One possibility is differences in susceptibility to metallomic dysregulation. A previous study of the PDD brain identified substantive perturbations in metal levels, including severe multiregional decreases in Cu. The current work uses the same methods to ascertain whether this metallomic dysfunction is also present in the PD brain. To do this, tissue from 9 PD cases free of cognitive decline and 15 equivalent controls was obtained from 7 brain regions. Levels of Na, Mg, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Se were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine any potential confounder effects. Results were compared with those previously obtained for PDD. It was found that decreased Cu in the medulla was the only statistically significant case-control difference observed in the PD brain; this contrasts markedly with the widespread metallic dysfunction observed in PDD. PD and PDD cases were well separated by PCA analysis. In the PD cohort, tau Braak stage correlated with Cu concentrations in several regions, but these correlations were not retained when including PDD cases. There is a marked difference in the metallomic profiles of PD and PDD, with an almost complete lack of metallic involvement observed in the former. This resistance to metallomic dysfunction may contribute to resilience against cognitive impairment in individuals with PD who do not develop dementia.  © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000267255,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We use acoustic force spectroscopy to characterize the dynamics of transcription elongation in ternary elongation complexes (ECs) of RNAP in the presence of Stl at a single-molecule level. We found that Stl induces long-lived stochastic pauses while the instantaneous velocity of transcription between the pauses is unaffected. Stl enhances the short-lived pauses associated with an off-pathway early paused state intermediates of the RNAP nucleotide addition cycle. Unexpectedly, we found that transcript cleavage factors GreA and GreB, which were thought to be Stl competitors, do not alleviate the Stl-induced pausing; instead, they synergistically increase transcription inhibition by Stl. This is the first known instance of a transcriptional factor enhancing antibiotic activity. We propose a structural model of the EC-Gre-Stl complex that explains the observed Stl activities and provides insight into possible cooperative action of secondary channel factors and other antibiotics binding at the Stl pocket.

In this study, we identified PHD and Ring Finger Domains 1 (PHRF1) as an important ATR activator through its interaction with TopBP1. Our analysis revealed a correlation between PHRF1 and genomic stability in cancer patients. Mechanistically, PHRF1 is recruited to DNA lesions in a manner dependent on its PHD domain and histone methylation. Subsequently, PHRF1 mono-ubiquitinates TopBP1 at lysine 73, which enhances the TopBP1-ATR interaction and activates ATR. Depletion of PHRF1 disrupts ATR activation and sensitizes cells to replication stress-inducing agents. Furthermore, conditional knockout of Phrf1 in mice leads to early lethality and impaired ATR-Chk1 axis signaling. Collectively, our findings establish PHRF1 as a novel E3 ligase for TopBP1, coordinating the replication stress response by enhancing TopBP1-ATR signaling. © The Author(s) 2025.

We show that the lack of BLM causes a decrease in the autophosphorylation of ATM in mice mammary glands, which have lost one or both copies of BLM. In isogenic human cells, the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway was dampened in the absence of BLM, which negatively affected the recruitment of DDR factors onto the chromatin, thereby indicating a direct role of BLM in augmenting DDR. Mechanistically, this was due to the BLM-dependent dissociation of inactive ATM dimers into active monomers. Fragmentation analysis of BLM followed by kinase assays revealed a 20-mer BLM peptide (91–110 aa), sufficient to enhance ATM-dependent p53 phosphorylation. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BLM at Thr99 within BLM (91–110) peptide enhanced ATM kinase activity due to its interaction with NBS1 and causing ATM monomerization. Delivery of phosphomimetic T99E counterpart of BLM (91–110 aa) peptide led to ATM activation followed by restoration of the DDR even in the absence of ionizing irradiation (both in cells and in BLM knockout mice), indicating its role as a DDR agonist, which can be potentially used to prevent the initiation of neoplastic transformation. © The Author(s) 2025.

Studying this process requires quantifying abundances of specific RNAs at precise subcellular locations. To analyze subcellular transcriptomes, multiple proximity-based techniques have been developed in which RNAs near a localized bait protein are specifically labeled, facilitating their biotinylation and purification. However, these complex methods are often laborious and require expensive enrichment reagents. To streamline the analysis of localized RNA populations, we developed Oxidation-Induced Nucleotide Conversion sequencing (OINC-seq). In OINC-seq, RNAs near a genetically encoded, localized bait protein are specifically oxidized in a photo-controllable manner. These oxidation events are then directly detected and quantified using high-throughput sequencing and our software package, PIGPEN, without the need for biotin-mediated enrichment. We demonstrate that OINC-seq can induce and quantify RNA oxidation with high specificity in a dose- and light-dependent manner. We further show the spatial specificity of OINC-seq by using it to quantify subcellular transcriptomes associated with the cytoplasm, ER, nucleus, and the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria. Finally, using transgenic zebrafish, we demonstrate that OINC-seq allows proximity-mediated RNA labeling in live animals. In sum, OINC-seq together with PIGPEN provide an accessible workflow for analyzing localized RNAs across different biological systems. © The Author(s) 2025.

The BeStSel web server utilizes this method to provide tools to the community for CD spectrum analysis. BeStSel uniquely provides information on eight secondary structure components, including parallel β-structure and antiparallel β-sheets with three different twist groups. It outperforms all available methods in accuracy and information content, and is also able to predict protein folds down to the topology/homology level of the CATH classification. The algorithm has been further developed, and the accuracy of the estimation of the secondary structure elements is improved by 0.7% as an average on the reference dataset. A new module of the web server calculates protein stability from the thermal denaturation profile followed by CD.

It has also been known to play essential roles in trophoblast development and placentation. Dysregulation of PPARG in trophoblast differentiation has been implicated in pregnancy complications, such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms of PPARG-dependent target gene regulation and its interactions with other regulatory factors during human trophoblast differentiation remain unclear. Using human trophoblast stem cells (TSCs), mimicking placental cytotrophoblasts (CTs), and their differentiation into extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) as our models, we reveal that PPARG has cell-type-specific targets in TSCs and EVTs. We also find that while PPARG is essential for both TSC self-renewal and EVT differentiation, only its role in EVT differentiation is ligand sensitive and requires ligand-binding domain (LBD)-mediated transcriptional activity, whereas its function in TSC self-renewal appears to be ligand insensitive. Combined analysis with chromosomal targets of previously defined key TFs in TSCs and EVTs shows that PPARG forms trophoblast cell-type-specific regulatory circuitries, leading to differential target gene regulation via transcriptional re-wiring during EVT differentiation. Additionally, the enhanced invasiveness of EVTs treated with a PPARG agonist suggests a potential connection between PPARG pathways and human placenta accreta.  © 2025 The Author(s).

We aimed to investigate associations between snus and cardiometabolic health markers among young men and women. Aims and Methods: This study was conducted within the BAMSE (Swedish acronym for Children, Allergy, Environment, Stockholm, Epidemiology) birth cohort and included participants followed up around 24 years (n = 2256) and 26 years (n = 1011). Snus use was assessed at 24 years by questionnaires. Cardiometabolic health markers were recorded at clinical examinations at 24 and 26 years. Associations between snus use and cardiometabolic markers were assessed by multivariable linear regression. Results: Snus was used by 6.4% (n = 81) among women and 21.9% (n = 219) among men. Compared to no tobacco use, daily exclusive snus use among women at 24 years was associated with higher body mass index (BMI) (adjusted β: 1.93 kg/m2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54, 3.33) and waist circumference (WC) (aβ: 3.80 cm, 95% CI = 0.41, 7.18) at 24 years, and with higher BMI (aβ: 2.73 kg/m2, 95% CI = 0.53 to 4.93) at 26 years. Among men, using ≥4 cans/week was associated with increased BMI (aβ: 2.48 kg/m2, 95% CI = 0.73, 4.24) and a tendency toward increased body fat (aβ: 2.31%, 95% CI = −0.53, 5.14) at 26 years. Snus use was not associated with glycemic status or blood pressure. Conclusions: Our results suggest that snus is associated with increased BMI, and possibly other measures of adiposity, among young women and heavy-using young men. Given the cross-sectional study design, the results should be interpreted with caution. Implications: We found cross-sectional associations between snus use and measures of increased adiposity in a cohort of Swedish young adults, including BMI and WC among women and BMI among heavy snus-using men. We did not find associations between snus use and body fat %, glycemic status, or blood pressure. This is one of few studies to investigate the health effect of snus among both women and men as well as cardiometabolic health markers in young adults. Given the recent trends of increased snus use among young adults, our findings highlight the need for further research on snus on cardiometabolic health. © The Author(s) 2024.

Approach and Results: A total of 1300 patients who achieved sustained viral response with direct-acting antivirals from 2014 to 2017 in Spain were included: 1145 with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (384 advanced fibrosis and 761 compensated cirrhosis) and 155 with decompensated cirrhosis. The median follow-up was 40.9 months. Overall, 85 deaths occurred, 61 due to non-liver non-AIDS-related causes that were the leading cause of death across all stages of liver disease. The incidence (95% CI) of decompensation per 100 person-years (py) was 0 in patients with advanced fibrosis, 1.01 (0.68-1.51) in patients with compensated cirrhosis, and 8.35 (6.05-11.53) in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The incidence (95% CI) of HCC per 100 py was 0.34 (0.13-0.91) in patients with advanced fibrosis, 0.73 (0.45-1.18) in patients with compensated cirrhosis, and 1.92 (1.00-3.70) per 100 py in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Prognostic factors for decompensation in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease included serum albumin, liver stiffness measurement (LSM), and fibrosis 4. In this population, LSM and LSM-based posttreatment risk stratification models showed their predictive ability for decompensation and HCC. Conclusions: Non-liver non-AIDS-related events were the leading causes of morbidity and mortality after direct-acting antiviral cure among coinfected patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.

The impact of type Ⅰ and type Ⅱ DM on adverse postoperative outcomes, mortality, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and increased in-hospital costs following cervical fusion surgery remains unclear in the past decade. This study aims to determine the specific effect of different classifications of DM on postoperative complications in patients experiencing cervical fusion surgery. METHOD: Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was acquired between 2010 and 2019. Patients experiencing cervical fusion were included and classified as having type I DM, type II DM, or neither. Patient demographics, hospital characteristics, operative variables, comorbidities, complications, and other postoperative outcomes were assessed. Propensity score matching analysis was used to balance baseline differences. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were employed to determine the risk of postoperative outcomes in patients with different classifications of DM. RESULT: A total of 267 174 cervical spinal fusions were identified (224 255 were patients without DM, 670 patients had type I DM, and 42 249 patients had type II DM). After propensity score matching, the multivariate analysis of non-DM and type I DM patients shows a significant difference in pneumonia ( P =0.020). However, type Ⅱ DM served as an independent predictor of an increased risk of acute cerebrovascular disease ( P =0.001), acute myocardial infarction ( P =0.014), pneumonia ( P =0.045), continuous trauma ventilation ( P =0.016), chest pain ( P <0.001), urinary tract infection ( P <0.001), transfusion ( P =0.005) and dysphagia ( P =0.013), prolonged LOS ( P <0.001), and increased costs ( P =0.008). CONCLUSION: Using non-DM patients as a reference, the type II DM group demonstrated a higher risk of postoperative complications than the type I DM group among patients receiving cervical fusion surgery. This vital distinction could enhance risk stratification and guidance for patients diagnosed with DM before cervical fusion surgery. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

METHODS: Patients were enrolled from January 2009 to October 2023 and were randomly divided (2:1) into development and validation cohorts. Predictors of severe adhesion were identified and integrated into a nomogram. The nomogram's performance was evaluated through calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility. Results : A total of 414 patients were included, with 276 in the development cohort and 138 in the validation cohort. Severe adhesion was diagnosed in 54 (13%) patients, including 37 (13.4%) in the development cohort and 17 (12.3%) in the validation cohort ( P = 0.76). Five predictors were identified: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, duration of early-stage abdominal infection, preoperative albumin (Alb) <35 g/L, visceral to subcutaneous fat area ratio, and preoperative C-reactive protein >10 mg/L. The nomogram demonstrated robust discrimination, with a concordance index (C-index) of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90) in internal validation, and was well-calibrated. In the validation cohort, the model maintained good discrimination (C-index = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67-0.94) and calibration. Decision curve analysis affirmed the nomogram's clinical utility. CONCLUSION: This study introduces a practical nomogram for assessing the risk of severe abdominal adhesion prior to DS in patients undergoing surgery for anastomotic fistula after SIR.

However, its role in cirrhosis has not been examined especially in low GFR. We analyzed the performance of CKD-EPI 2021 compared to other equations with protocol-measured GFR (mGFR) in cirrhosis. We analyzed 2090 unique adult patients with cirrhosis undergoing protocol GFR measurements using iothalamate clearance from 1985 to 2015 when listed for liver transplantation at Baylor University in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas. Using mGFR as a reference standard, the CKD-EPI 2021 was compared to CKD-EPI 2012, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-4, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-6, Royal Free Hospital, and GFR Assessment in Liver disease overall and in certain subgroups (ascites, mGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, diagnosis, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and gender). We examined bias (difference between eGFR and mGFR), accuracy (p30: eGFR within ± 30% of mGFR) and agreement between eGFR and mGFR categories. CKD-EPI 2021 had the second lowest bias across the entire range of GFR after GFR Assessment in Liver disease (6.6 vs. 4.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively, p < 0.001). The accuracy of CKD-EPI 2021 was similar to CKD-EPI 2012 (p30 = 67.8% vs. 67.9%, respectively) which was higher than the other equations (p < 0.001). It had a similar performance in patients with ascites, by diagnoses, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease subgroups, by gender, and in non-Black patients. However, it had a relatively higher overestimation in mGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 than most equations (18.5 mL/min/1.73m2, p < 0.001). Specifically, 64% of patients with mGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73m2 were incorrectly classified as a less severe CKD stage by CKD-EPI 2021. In Blacks, CKD-EPI 2021 underestimated eGFR by 17.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, which was higher than the alternate equations except for Royal Free Hospital (p < 0.001). The novel race-neutral eGFR equation, CKD-EPI 2021, improves the GFR estimation overall but may not accurately capture true kidney function in cirrhosis, specifically at low GFR. There is an urgent need for a race-neutral equation in liver disease reflecting the complexity of kidney function physiology unique to cirrhosis, given implications for organ allocation and dual organ transplant.

Li F.; Zhao Y.; Wang J.; Chen J.; Wang M.; Hu W.; Zhang B.,The Impact of Modified Body Mass Index on Clinical Prognosis in the Elderly With Acute Ischemic Stroke,2025,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0000000000000562,"OBJECTIVES: The modified body mass index (mBMI) combines the body mass index and serum albumin, accurately reflecting the nutritional status. It remains uncertain whether modified body mass index influences neurological function and clinical prognosis in elderly patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We divided the cohort into quartiles of mBMI (1 to 4). The primary outcome was analyzed using the percentage of patients with a 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 0 to 1. There were 7 secondary outcomes, including the disability level at 90 days and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 14 and 90 days. RESULTS: mBMI was negatively associated with clinical prognosis at 90-day mRS score in the primary outcome (β=-0.167; 95% CI -0.311 to 0.023, P =0.023). Moreover, mBMI1 (<896.72) and primary outcomes (β=0.438; 95% CI: -0.018 to 0.894) were positively correlated with higher mBMI. Moreover, the number and percentage of patients completing all the duties and activities are also higher. Age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (aCCI) and posterior circulation lesion were positively associated with the clinical prognosis 90-day mRS score in the primary outcome (β=2.218; 95% CI: 1.144-4.300, β=2.771; 95% CI: 1.700-4.516). However, BMI and serum albumin were not associated the with clinical prognosis primary outcome. BMI negatively correlates with secondary outcomes (NIHSS at discharge, β=-0.023; 95% CI: -0.102 to 0.057). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that mBMI and not BMI could be a better primary outcome predictor in the elderly with acute ischemic stroke, and lower mBMI showed a worse prognosis.

For patients who have difficulty controlling blood glucose even with insulin administration, xenogeneic islet cells, including human stem cell-derived pancreatic islets (hSC-islet) and porcine islets, have garnered attention as potential solutions to challenges associated with donor shortages. For the development of diabetes treatment modalities that use cell transplantation therapy, it is essential to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transplanted cells using experimental animals over the long term. Methods. We developed permanent diabetic immune-deficient mice by introducing the Akita (C96Y) mutation into the rodent-specific Insulin1 gene of NOD/Shi-scid IL2rγcnull (NOG) mice (Ins1C96Y/C96Y NOG). Their body weight, nonfasting blood glucose, and survival were measured from 4 wk of age. Insulin sensitivity was assessed via tolerance tests. To elucidate the utility of these mice in xenotransplantation experiments, we transplanted hSC-islet cells or porcine islets under the kidney capsules of these mice. Results. All male and female homozygous mice exhibited persistent severe hyperglycemia associated with β-cell depletion as early as 4 wk of age and exhibited normal insulin sensitivity. These mice could be stably engrafted with hSC-islets, and the mice that received porcine islet grafts promptly exhibited lowered blood glucose levels, maintaining blood glucose levels below the normal glucose range for at least 52 wk posttransplantation. Conclusions. The Ins1C96Y/C96Y NOG mouse model provides an effective platform to assess both the efficacy and safety of long-term xenograft engraftment without the interference of their immune responses. This study is expected to contribute essential basic information for the clinical application of islet cell transplantation.  Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Subnormothermic machine perfusion shows promise as a viable alternative to static cold storage for prolonged preservation of vascularized composite allografts. To date, most studies have been conducted in nonprimate models, and we report its first utilization in a cynomolgus forearm preclinical model for 24-h preservation. Methods. Forearms were procured from nonhuman primates weighing between 5 and 8 kg. Two perfusion protocols were implemented. In group 1 (n = 6), limbs were perfused with 1.5 L of recirculating Steen; the perfusate flow was adjusted to maintain stable vascular pressures. In group 2 (n = 6), limbs were perfused with a Steen+ solution, doubling the albumin concentration, with a full-volume exchange at mid-perfusion under a stable low-flow regimen. Dynamic and metabolic parameters, histological analysis, and response to neurostimulation were assessed. Results. After 24 h of continuous perfusion, mean weight gain was 24.8 ± 5.5% in group 1 and 8.0 ± 4.7% in group 2. Perfusion and metabolic parameters indicated the onset of a compartment syndrome in group 1 with an increase in resistance, lactate, and potassium production at mid-perfusion. In group 2, dynamic and metabolic parameters remained stable for 24 h, and histological analysis showed well-preserved tissues. Finally, in group 2, limbs exhibited muscular contraction recovery quantified at 2.4/5 ± 0.89 after 24 h compared with 0/5 after 3 h of ischemia or after perfusion in group 1. Conclusions. Successful 24-h perfusion and muscle contractility restoration demonstrate promising outcomes for vascularized composite allograft preservation and reconditioning. Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] measurement were prospectively included. Clinical stages were defined as follows: probable ACLD (pACLD): liver stiffness ≥10 kPa and HVPG ≤5 mmHg, S0: mild PH (HVPG 6–9 mmHg), S1: clinically significant PH (CSPH), S2: CSPH with varices, S3: past variceal bleeding, S4: past/current non-bleeding hepatic decompensation and S5: further decompensation. Results: In total, 269 patients were included; 105 were compensated (pACLD: n = 18; S0: n = 30; S1: n = 20; S2: n = 37), and 164 were decompensated (S3: n = 11; S4: n = 89; S5: n = 64). Median levels of IGF-1 decreased with progressive cirrhosis (from pACLD: 88.5 ng/mL to S5: 51.0 ng/mL; p < 0.001). Patients with CSPH had significantly lower IGF-1 levels (63.5 ng/mL vs. 81.0 ng/mL; p = 0.001). IGF-1 showed an independent negative association with body mass index (BMI; aB: −1.56; p < 0.001), enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test (aB: −8.43; p < 0.001), MELD (aB: −1.13; p = 0.042) and age (per 10 years; aB: −6.87; p < 0.001). IGF-1 exhibited an excellent AUROC (0.856) for the prediction of liver-related death at 6 months of follow-up. Lower IGF-1 (per 10 ng/mL) was linked to higher risk of (further) decompensation (0.90; 95% CI: 0.83–0.98; p = 0.016), acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF; asHR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.68–0.93; p = 0.004) and liver-related death (asHR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63–0.91; p = 0.004). Conclusion: Decreased levels of IGF-1 reflect impaired hepatic function and fibrogenesis in patients with cirrhosis, which seems particularly relevant in obesity since low IGF-1 was independently linked to high BMI.

Due to the obesity epidemic, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a frequent HCC aetiology that often coincides with increased alcohol consumption, termed MetALD, or even alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Methods: Patients undergoing LR or OLT for HCC at Charité—Universitätsmedizin Berlin (2010–2020) were included in this retrospective cohort study investigating disease aetiology, time to recurrence (TTR), overall survival (OS) and CT-based body composition. Results: Out of 579 patients with HCC, 417 underwent LR and 162 OLT. Tumour aetiologies were viral n = 191 (33.0%), MASLD n = 158 (27.3%), MetALD n = 51 (8.8%), ALD n = 68 (11.7%) and other/cryptogenic n = 111 (19.2%). Patients with MASLD and MetALD had more intramuscular (p < 0.001, p = 0.015) and visceral fat (both p < 0.001) than patients with non-metabolic dysfunction aetiologies. Patients with MASLD-HCC had comparable TTR (median 26 months, [95% CI: 23–31] vs. 30 months [95% CI: 4–57], p = 0.425) but shorter OS than patients with other HCC aetiologies (63 months [95% CI: 42–84] vs. 80 months [95% CI: 60–100], hazard ratio: 1.53 [95% CI: 1.050–2.229], p = 0.026) after LR. Multivariate analysis confirmed MASLD aetiology, portal vein thrombosis and MELD score ≥ 10 as independent prognostic factors for OS in LR (adjusted p = 0.021,p < 0.001,p = 0.003), even after excluding in-hospital mortality (adjusted p = 0.016,p = 0.002,p = 0.002). Causes of death were similar in MASLD and non-MASLD aetiology. Conclusions: Patients with HCC undergoing LR and meeting the new MASLD criteria have significantly shorter OS. This study provides empirical prognostic evidence for the novel MASLD/MetALD classification in a large European cohort of patients undergoing curative-intent HCC therapy. © 2025 The Author(s).

Samuels A.; Irie K.; Mizuno T.; Reifenberg J.; Punt N.; Vinks A.A.; Minar P.,Integrating early response biomarkers in pharmacokinetic models: A novel method to individualize the initial infliximab dose in patients with Crohn's disease,2025,Clinical and Translational Science,10.1111/cts.70086,"The use of model-informed precision dosing to personalize infliximab has been shown to improve both the acquisition of concentration targets and clinical outcomes during maintenance. Current iterations of infliximab pharmacokinetic models include time-varying covariates of drug clearance, however, not accounting for the expected improvements in the covariates can lead to indiscriminate use of higher infliximab doses and imprecise drug exposure. The aim was to identify changes in the four biomarkers associated with infliximab clearance (Xiong et al. model) and determine if integration of these dynamic changes would improve model performance during induction and early maintenance. We analyzed two cohorts of children receiving infliximab for Crohn's Disease. The Emax method was used to assess time-varying changes in covariates. Model performance (observed vs. predicted infliximab concentrations) was evaluated using median percentage error (bias) and median absolute percentage error (precision). The combined cohorts included 239 Crohn's disease patients. We found from baseline to dose 4, the maximum changes in weight, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and neutrophil CD64 were 4.7%, +11.7%, −62.4%, and −26.5%, respectively. We also found the use of baseline covariates alone to forecast future trough concentration was inferior to the Emax time-varying method with a significant improvement observed in bias (doses 2, 3, and 4) and precision (doses 2 and 4). The integration of the four time-varying biomarkers of drug clearance with pharmacokinetic modeling improved the accuracy and precision of the predictions. This novel strategy may be key to improving drug exposure, minimizing indiscriminate dosing strategies, and reducing healthcare costs. © 2025 The Author(s).

Pharmacokinetics (PK) data of iruplinalkib have been collected in healthy subjects and patient populations in several studies. We developed a population PK (PopPK) model for describing iruplinalkib plasma concentrations and for evaluating whether dose adjustments are necessary based on demographic factors or disease characteristics. Plasma concentration–time data were collected from 392 participants (16 healthy volunteers and 372 patients with solid tumors) who received single or multiple doses of iruplinalkib in four trials. Data were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Iruplinalkib plasma concentrations were best described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. Baseline body weight, time-varying albumin, time-varying creatinine clearance, and time-varying lactate dehydrogenase were significant covariates of apparent clearance from the central compartment (CL/F) while baseline body weight was a significant covariate of apparent volume of the central compartment (V1/F). Given the small or modest effect of all statistically significant covariates on iruplinalkib exposure at steady-state, no covariate was expected to have clinically meaningful effects on iruplinalkib exposure. Furthermore, iruplinalkib absorption was delayed 0.472 h after meal, and Ka was 58.8% of that under fasting. However, there was no difference in exposure of iruplinalkib between the fasted and fed states. In conclusion, the PopPK model adequately describes iruplinalkib PK properties in Chinese healthy subjects and patients with solid tumors. No covariate had a clinically meaningful impact on iruplinalkib exposure. These results indicate that dose adjustment of iruplinalkib is not necessary, based on the aforementioned covariates, for ALK-positive NSCLC patients. © 2024 Qilu Pharmaceutical Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using self-reported survey data collected from April 2019 to October 2023. Primary exposures were social disadvantage indicators (Race, income, education, employment, insurance, immigration, rural/urban location). Primary outcomes were insulin pump and CGM use. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between social disadvantage indicators and the odds of insulin pump and CGM use. Results: Among 2380 adults with T1D, 37.4% used insulin pumps and 82.5% used CGM. Insulin pump use was lower among those with income <$80 000 (odds ratio [OR] 0.64 [95% confidence interval 0.50–0.82]), no post-secondary education (OR 0.62 [0.46–0.85]), non-White Race (OR 0.47 [0.30–0.73]) and public insurance (OR 0.47 [0.35–0.62]). CGM use was lower only among those with income <$80 000 (OR 0.61 [0.45–0.83]) and public insurance (OR 0.61 [0.45–0.83]). Odds of insulin pump and CGM use were successively lower with an increasing number of social disadvantage indicators. Insulin pump and CGM use were both associated with lower HbA1c but not severe hypoglycaemia or diabetes hospitalisation. Conclusions: Social disadvantage is associated with lower uptake of insulin pumps and CGM among Quebec adults with T1D, though public funding partially mitigates disparities in CGM use. Given the benefits and increasing recommendations for automated insulin delivery, strategies to increase the uptake of diabetes technologies among socially disadvantaged individuals are required. Plain Language Summary: Social disadvantage is linked to lower use of insulin pumps and CGM in adults with T1D in Quebec. Public funding narrows CGM disparities, but broader equity strategies are needed. © 2025 The Author(s).

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified plausible loci correlated with peripheral levels of Fe. Systemic organs and the brain share several Fe regulatory proteins but there likely exist different homeostatic pathways. We performed the first GWAS of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measures of postmortem brain Fe from 635 Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) participants. Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with Fe in at least one of four brain regions were measured (p < 5 × 10−8). Promising SNPs (p < 5 × 10−6) were followed up for replication in published GWAS of blood, spleen, and brain imaging Fe traits and mapped to candidate genes for targeted cortical transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis of postmortem Fe in MAP. Results for SNPs previously associated with other Fe traits were also examined. Ninety-eight SNPs associated with postmortem brain Fe were at least nominally (p < 0.05) associated with one or more related Fe traits. Most novel loci identified had no direct links to Fe regulatory pathways but rather endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi trafficking (SORL1, SORCS2, MARCH1, CLTC), heparan sulfate (HS3ST4, HS3ST1), and coenzyme A (SLC5A6, PANK3); supported by nearest gene function and omic analyses. We replicated (p < 0.05) several previously published Fe loci mapping to candidate genes in cellular and systemic Fe regulation. Finally, novel loci (BMAL, COQ5, SLC25A11) and replication of prior loci (PINK1, PPIF, LONP1) lend support to the role of circadian rhythms and mitochondria function in Fe regulation more generally. In summary, we provide support for novel loci linked to pathways that may have greater relevance to brain Fe accumulation; some of which are implicated in neurodegeneration. However, replication of a subset of prior loci for blood Fe suggests that genetic determinants or biological pathways underlying Fe accumulation in the brain are not completely distinct from those of Fe circulating in the periphery.

Materials and Methods: Medical records were searched for dogs with histologically and immunohistochemically characterised nodular splenic lesions with mixed stromal, histiocytic and lymphoid cells and the presence of systemic inflammatory markers at the time of diagnosis. Results: Four dogs were included, of which three had an undifferentiated splenic stromal sarcoma and one had a splenic leiomyosarcoma. Fever and abdominal pain were reported in three and four cases, respectively. All dogs showed hyperglobulinaemia and marked changes in the serum protein electrophoresis profile. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen concentrations were both increased in three cases. These abnormalities completely resolved after splenectomy. Moreover, two dogs had concomitant glomerular disease and one dog had liver amyloidosis. Three dogs were still alive and asymptomatic 1, 6 and 9 months after surgery. One dog died 16 months after the initial presentation due to complications related to progressive renal failure. Clinical Significance: Based on this report, nodular splenic lesions with heterogeneous cell components may directly be associated with a pro-inflammatory state and should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of fever and hyperglobulinaemia in dogs. Furthermore, early recognition and treatment of these lesions could reduce the risk of systemic complications potentially associated with amyloid deposit and organ failure. © 2025 The Author(s).

A Qualitative Study of the Everyday Management of Type 1 Diabetes Among People with Unexplained Persistent Hyperglycaemia,2025,Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences,10.1111/scs.70001,"Background: Despite advances in diabetes care, many people with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) still experience persistent hyperglycaemia, leading to reduced quality of life and increased risk of long-term complications. For some, this hyperglycaemia is linked to factors like co-morbidities, socio-economic challenges, or low health literacy. However, for many, persistent hyperglycaemia remains clinically unexplained, indicating a gap in understanding the contributing factors. Aim: To explore the lived experiences and everyday management of T1D among adults with clinically unexplained persistent hyperglycaemia (HbA1c ≥ 70 mmol/mol), with the goal of informing caring practices that support better health outcomes. Methods: Using an anthropological approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with 19 adults. The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: The analysis identified four themes: (1) ‘Embodied diabetes’ described how the risk of low blood sugar shaped daily management as it could impact productivity and social interactions, highlighting the need for empathetic support. High levels were more tolerable, yet frustratingly unpredictable and perceived as ‘unruly.’ (2) ‘Inescapable diabetes’ described diabetes as a presence that had to be navigated alongside life's complexities and how the participants sought to balance immediate concerns that were often prioritised over perfect glucose levels, underscoring the importance of holistic care approaches. (3) ‘Desire for normalcy’ described the weighing between concealment and disclosure of T1D and the detailed planning required to integrate diabetes seamlessly into everyday life, suggesting a need for personalised care strategies. Finally, (4) ‘Diverse interactions with the diabetes clinic’ described experiences from sincere interactions to feelings of resignation. Clinical advice was sometimes dismissed due to perceived ineffectiveness or lack of relevance, indicating opportunities for improving patient-provider relationships. Conclusion: This study highlights the complexities of daily diabetes management and emphasises the importance of a caring and holistic approach that incorporates the myriad obligations, concerns and desires that adults with T1D navigate and prioritise alongside or in competition with their disease. By understanding these lived experiences, healthcare professionals can better support patients through patient-centred care practices that address both medical and personal dimensions of living with T1D. © 2025 The Author(s).

Davenport A.,The changing face of dialyzer membranes and dialyzers,2025,Seminars in Dialysis,10.1111/sdi.13161,"The key goals for dialysis treatments are to prevent the progressive accumulation of waste products of metabolism and volume overload. Traditionally uremic solutes have been classified according to molecular weight and termed small, middle sized, and large solutes. Solute clearance during dialysis sessions will potentially be by diffusion, convection and adsorption. Dialyzer membranes act as a semi-permeable membrane restricting solute removal predominantly by size. Small molecules move faster than large molecules, so small solutes are readily removed by diffusion. Increasing the size of the pores in the membrane will potentially allow middle and larger sized solutes to pass through the dialyzer membrane, although in practice there is a limit to increasing pore sizes to prevent the loss of albumin and other important proteins. Differences in membrane surface and charge will influence protein absorption. The removal of fluid during dialysis depends in part on the hydraulic permeability of the membrane. Combining higher hydraulic permeability and larger sized pores increases convective clearance with solutes moving across the membrane with the water movement. Depending upon dialyzer design, higher hydrostatic pressure as blood enters the dialyzer leads to a variable amount of internal diafiltration, so improving the clearance of middle sized solutes. Although the dialyzer membrane plays a key role in solute clearance, the design of the casing and header also play a role in directing the countercurrent blood and dialysate flows to maximize the surface area available for diffusive and convective clearances. © 2023 The Author.

Padmanabhan S.; Prakash J.,Deep tissue sensing of chiral molecules using polarization-enhanced photoacoustics,2025,Science Advances ,10.1126/sciadv.ado8012,"Chiral molecule sensing is typically performed using techniques like chromatography, electrophoresis, enzymatic assays, mass spectrometry, and chiroptical methods. While polarimetry allows for in vivo sensing up to 1 mm depth using ultraviolet-visible light, it is limited by dominant light scattering beyond this depth. We propose that photoacoustic sensing in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window can enable deep tissue sensing as acoustic waves scatter less than light. To achieve this, we developed a photoacoustic polarization–enhanced optical rotation sensing (PAPEORS) system, capable of estimating optical rotation from photoacoustic signals and correlating it with chiral molecular concentration for depths up to 3.5 mm. Experiments were conducted using aqueous glucose solutions, naproxen, serum-based glucose samples, and ex vivo chicken tissue. PAPEORS achieved a detection limit of 80 mg/dl while using circularly polarized light with serum samples, demonstrating the potential for deep-tissue chiral molecular sensing. PAPEORS holds promise for in vivo sensing and easy miniaturization using single wavelength.

Interactions between particles and human neutrophils remain largely unexplored, although they represent a critical aspect of VTC performance. Here, we explore the impact of particle elasticity on primary human neutrophil phagocytosis using polyethylene glycol–based particles of different elastic moduli. We found that neutrophils effectively phagocytose deformable particles irrespective of their modulus, indicating a departure from established phagocytosis trends seen with other types of immune cells. These findings highlight the observed phenotypic difference between different types of phagocytes and underscore the need to characterize VTC performance using various cell types and animal models that represent human systems closely. copyright © 2025 the Authors, some rights reserved.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214589107,Cell type; Elasticity

Death receptor 5 (DR5) mediates extrinsic apoptosis. We engineer DR5 agonistic single-chain variable fragment (scFv) expression on the surface of sEVs derived from natural killer cells. PDGFR transmembrane domain delivers DR5-scFvs to the surface of sEVs. DR5-scFv sEVs rapidly induce apoptosis of different types of DR5+ cancer cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). DR5-scFv sEVs migrate specifically to DR5+ tumors in vitro and in vivo. Systemic delivery of DR5-scFv sEVs significantly inhibits the growth of DR5+ melanoma, liver cancer, and breast cancer and prolongs mouse life span without significant toxicity. DR5-scFv sEVs are significantly more efficacious than DR5 antibodies in vivo. In organotypic patient-derived melanoma slice cultures, DR5-scFv sEVs effectively inhibit melanoma cells and MDSCs and activate CD8+ T cells. Our studies demonstrate that DR5-scFv sEVs can inhibit tumor growth by targeting tumor cells and immunosuppressive stromal cells in the TME. © 2025 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Herein, we describe a rational strategy for designing optical probes crossing the BBB based on an electron donor-π-acceptor system to adjust the lipid/ water partition coefficient and molecular weight of probes. The amphiphilic hemicyanine dye (namely, IVTPO), which exhibits remarkable optical properties and effective BBB permeability, is chosen as an efficient fluorescence/ photoacoustic probe for in vivo real-time imaging of orthotopic GBM with high resolution through the intact skull. Abnormal leakage of IVTPO adjacent to the developing tumor is unambiguously observed at an early stage of tumor development prior to impairment of BBB integrity, as assessed by commercial Evans blue (EB). Compared with EB, IVTPO demonstrates enhanced optical imaging capability and improved tumor-targeting efficacy. These results offer encouraging insights into medical diagnosis of intracranial GBM.

The liver resident macrophages, Kupffer cells, form the hepatic firewall to clear many encapsulated bacteria in the blood circulation but fail to control certain high-virulence capsule types. Here we report that the spleen is the backup immune organ to clear the liver-resistant serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a leading human pathogen. Asplenic mice failed to control the growth of the liver-resistant pneumococci in the blood circulation. Immunologic and genetic analyses identified splenic red pulp (RP) macrophages as the major phagocytes for bacterial clearance. Furthermore, the plasma natural antibodies against the cell wall phosphocholine and the complement system were necessary for RP macrophage–mediated immunity. These findings have provided a conceptual framework for the innate defense against blood bacterial infections, a mechanistic explanation for the hyper-susceptibility of asplenic individuals to S. pneumoniae, and a proof of concept for developing vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against encapsulated pathogens.

Our albumin-tagging dye serves as a chromophore to construct NIR-II fluorescent proteins in situ, with substantially improved brightness. Thus, through in situ dye tagging of endogenous albumin as the efficient “targeting agent,” we can precisely image disruptions in various endothelial barriers.

Research design and methods Using data from a primary care dataset linked with multiple health registries, this longitudinal study analyzed demographics, clinical data, and lifestyle factors of women diagnosed with GDM or IGT, assessing T2D incidence over 25 years, using Cox regression models. Results Women with GDM, especially those over 35 years of Māori ethnicity, or socioeconomic deprivation, exhibited an elevated risk of T2D compared with those with IGT. The first 5 years post partum emerged as a critical window for intervention. Conclusions This study underscores the importance of early, targeted post-GDM interventions to mitigate T2D risk. It highlights the necessity of personalized post-GDM interventions to reduce T2D incidence which consider age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status to maximize effectiveness. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211688497,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Research design and methods Prospectively collected HbA 1c data from the ADVANCE biomarker case-cohort study, updated at 6 months and every 12 months thereafter over a median of 5.0 (IQR 4.5-5.3) years, were analyzed in relation to incident CAD in the Hp2-2 (n=1323) and non-Hp2-2 (n=2069) phenotypes separately using weighted multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models. Additional a priori stratifications by sex, race, previous cardiovascular disease (CVD), and type 2 diabetes duration were performed. Results Mean HbA 1c was similar in each phenotype group throughout the study. Compared with HbA 1c of 7.0%-7.9%, HbA 1c <7.0% was not associated with CAD risk for any phenotype group or subgroup. HbA 1c ≥8.0% compared with 7.0%-7.9% over time was associated with higher CAD risk for the Hp2-2 phenotype only (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.32; no significant association in the non-Hp2-2 type: 1.26, 0.89 to 1.77, p-interaction=0.71); this was pronounced when those with previous CVD at baseline were excluded (Hp2-2: 2.80, 1.41 to 5.53, p-interaction=0.03). Compared with HbA 1c of <8.0%, having HbA 1c ≥8.0% was associated with a 59% higher CAD risk among participants with the Hp2-2 phenotype (1.59, 1.12 to 2.26) and a 39% higher CAD risk among participants without the Hp2-2 phenotype (1.39, 1.03 to 1.88, p-interaction=0.97). Conclusions The present ADVANCE analysis suggests that not having HbA 1c ≥8.0%, rather than achieving HbA 1c <7.0%, was found to be particularly important for CAD prevention among people with type 2 diabetes and the common Hp2-2 phenotype. While the subgroup analyses were likely underpowered, their inclusion is hypothesis generating and can be used in future meta-analyses to improve power and generalizability.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004655461,Glycated hemoglobin; Haptoglobin

Awareness of personal clinical data has resulted in improved glycaemic control in adults with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, its effects on their health-seeking behaviour remain unclear. This study aims to explore and understand the effects of a multicomponent TM system on self-efficacy in adults with T2DM. Design A qualitative study using semistructured interviews. Setting A public primary care clinic which is located at an estate in north-eastern Singapore with a population of about 300 000 multiethnic Asian residents. Participants 21 participants who completed 6 months of TM intervention which included immediate feedback on glucose and blood pressure readings, educational videos on exercise and nutrition, and personalised support with TM nurse when clinical parameters met high glucose or blood pressure thresholds. Results The health belief model was used to explain the participants’ behaviour change, including (1) immediate feedback from TM clinical parameters (blood pressure and glucose), raised their awareness of their health status and disease control to motivate behaviour change; (2) notification of higher glucose through TM allowed patients to reflect on their recent food consumption and nudged them to select healthier food options; (3) App teleeducation improved health literacy and supported lifestyle changes; (4) cues for action through personalised engagement with TM nurse and via automated reminders and (5) the TM system enhanced self-efficacy by modifying their multifaceted self-care behaviours. Conclusion TM heightened understanding among adults with T2DM of their potential for health complications and increased awareness of the benefits of proper diabetes management. It also helped lower the barriers to self-management and further enhanced their self-efficacy in self-care. The system and care team provided users with cues for health which was perceived to lead to adapting their lifestyle in order to achieve better health outcomes. © 2024 BMJ Publishing Group.

Nevertheless, variations exist in the observed association between night shift work and prostate cancer (PCa). This study aims to systematically explore the association between night shift work and the risk of PCa. Design Cohort study and Mendelian randomisation (MR) study were used. Setting Cohort study data was from the UK Biobank (UKB). MR study using data was from the Finngen study and UKB through the Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) Open Genome-Wide Association Study Project. Participants Participants without prior PCa in paid employment or self-employment were include in the current work schedule cohort, participants without PCa who provided employment history formed the lifetime night shift work cohort. Main outcome measures The outcome, incident PCa, was obtained from cancer register through linkage to national cancer databases. National cancer registries centralised information received from separate regional cancer centres around the UK. Results A total of 130 853 participants were included in the current work schedule cohort, while the lifetime night shift work cohort comprised 49 511 participants. Over a median follow-up duration of 13.9 years, the current work schedule cohort witnessed 4993 incident cases of PCa, while the lifetime night shift work cohort recorded 2022 PCa cases. In the analysis of the current work schedule, final model showed that no significant association was found between shift work and PCa risk, whether it involved shift but no night shifts (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.08), some night shifts (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.33) and usual night shifts (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.19). In the analysis of the average frequency of night shift work, final model showed no significant impact of different night shift frequencies (<3/month: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.29; 3-8/month: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19; >8/month: HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.07) on the risk of PCa. No significant association was found for either <10 years (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.09) or ≥10 years (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16) of night shift work. Subsequent subgroup and sensitivity analyses demonstrated consistent results without significant alterations. Furthermore, in the two-sample MR analysis, no statistically significant causal relationship was identified between night shift work and the incidence of PCa.

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting The online questionnaire survey was conducted between April and July 2023. Participants GPs from community health centres (CHCs) in all 16 districts of Shanghai were recruited. Primary and secondary outcome measures The data of sociodemographic characteristics, KAP scales, training experience and screening instruments for community screening and managing diabetic microvascular complications were collected. Multiple stepwise linear regression was used to explore the influencing factors of KAP. Restricted cubic spline curves with four knots (5%, 35%, 65%, 95%) were used to determine the association between KAP score and duration of general practice. Results A total of 1243 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The total KAP score was 66.6±8.8/100, and the knowledge, attitude and practice scores were 64.7±8.7, 83.5±10.5 and 51.6+17.8, respectively. Male (β=−2.419, p=0.012), shorter practice duration (β=−1.033, p=0.031), practice in rural area (β=3.230, p=0.001), not attending training in diabetic microvascular complications (β=−6.346, p<0.001), not managing diabetic patients (β=−4.503, p<0.001), less number of diabetes patients under management (β=−0.007, p=0.035), less number of screening instruments based on self-report of GP (β=−1.681, p<0.001), lower knowledge score (β=−0.190, p<0.001) and lower attitude score (β=−0.414, p<0.001) were associated with lower practice score of GPs. The KAP total score increased with the working years of general practice; however, this effect was no longer observed in knowledge score after 15 years, while the attitude and practice scores showed a continuously increasing trend. Conclusions GPs showed insufficient knowledge and poor clinical practice on screening and managing diabetic microvascular complications. There is an urgent need to improve their capacity to provide better care for those with diabetic microvascular complications through targeted training. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216859085,Cross-sectional study

Design The drug procurement data were obtained from the Shanghai Medical Procurement Agency between January 2016 and December 2022. We examined changes in volume, expenditure of overall hypoglycaemic drugs by descriptive analysis. For novel hypoglycaemic drugs, we employed interrupted time series analysis with segmented regression to investigate the change in usage, expenditure and daily cost of specific drug affected by related policies. Setting All the public and private hospitals in Shanghai, China. Primary outcome measures Volume, expenditure and daily cost of novel hypoglycaemic drugs. Results From 2016 to 2022, the overall usage and expenditure of hypoglycaemic drugs in Shanghai have been gradually increasing. Consumption of novel hypoglycaemic drugs had shown a rapid increase, which was significantly increased by 212.28 defined daily doses (95% CI 188.25, 236.31, p<0.001) after policy implementation. For each specific drug, daily cost was significantly decreased immediately after policy implementation (p<0.001). Dulaglutide, loxenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide and dapagliflozin had all seen significant increases in consumption and expenditure after NDPN implementation (p<0.001). Vildagliptin and saxagliptin, which were affected by the NCDP, experienced a significant decrease in usage. Empagliflozin and canagliflozin, which were regulated by both NCDP and NDPN, experienced an initial increase, followed by a significant decline. Consumption of beinaglutide and exenatide was not upregulated by NDPN. Conclusion Implementation of NDPN and NCDP had successfully cut-off the price of novel hypoglycaemic drugs and significantly increased their utilisation. In the future, the government needs to control pharmaceutical expenses more strictly while ensuring the rational use of the drugs. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211416123,Defined daily dose; Glimepiride

Although there is an underlying genetic predisposition to developing T1D, the trigger is multifactorial and likely includes environmental factors. The intestinal microbiome has been identified as one such factor. Previous studies have illustrated differences in the microbiota of people with T1D compared with healthy controls. This study aims to describe the evolution of the microbiome and metabolome during the first year of clinical T1D, or stage 3 T1D diagnosis, and investigate whether there are differences in the microbiome and metabolome of children who present with and without diabetic ketoacidosis. The study will also explore possible associations between the microbiome, metabolome, glycaemic control and beta cell reserve. Methods and analysis This prospective cohort study will include children with newly diagnosed T1D and sibling controls (n=100, males and females) and their faecal microbiome will be characterised using shotgun metagenomic sequencing at multiple time points during the first year of diagnosis. We will develop a microbial culture biobank based on culturomic studies of stool samples from the healthy controls that will support future investigation. Metabolomic analysis will aim to identify additional biomarkers which may be involved in disease presentation and progression. Through this initial exploratory study, we aim to identify specific microbial biomarkers which may be used as future interventional targets throughout the various stages of T1D progression. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals. Study results will be available to patients with T1D and their families, carers, support networks and microbiome societies and other researchers. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216993673,Metabolome

Mixed-methods research in rural Bangladesh,2025,BMJ Open,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-089288,"Objectives Research indicates the effectiveness of participatory interventions to address rapid rises in type 2 diabetes in low-income countries. Understanding their transferability to different contexts is a priority. We aimed to analyse how the COVID-19 post-lockdown context and adjustments to a participatory learning and action intervention affected theorised mechanisms of effect in rural Bangladesh and to examine the broader implications of this context and intervention adjustments for developing optimal contexts for participatory interventions. Design Mixed methods using longitudinal qualitative and quantitative observation data, focus group discussions and interviews with group and community members and project personnel. We used descriptive content analysis, guided by realist evaluation research questions about context, implementation and mechanisms. We used team reflection to enhance the rigour of our analysis. Setting Cluster-randomised trial in Alfadanga upazila, Faridpur district, in the central region of Bangladesh. The intervention was implemented between January 2020 and December 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants Participatory group members, community members and project personnel (n=32). Structured observations of participatory groups (n=1820) and unstructured observations of groups and their environments (n=15). Interventions Participatory learning and action community groups of men and women implemented by community-based facilitators. Results Due to COVID-19, the participatory learning and action (PLA) intervention was not implemented as planned, which had major effects on the time available to develop the intervention with communities. Communities learnt about diabetes and were motivated to address its causes at an individual level, but community action was a more challenging mechanism to trigger. The post-pandemic context made it difficult to build community rapport, and strategies to engage communities through home visits were challenging. Communities' prior negative experience in working together and in working with non-governmental organisations led to low community cohesion and low motivation to address diabetes collectively. This also resulted in expectations that the implementing organisation would implement community actions and incentivise attendance at meetings. This misalignment of expectations further disabled relationship building, and community strategies addressing the social causes of diabetes were largely not enacted. Conclusion PLA has optimal effects when time is available to build trust and social cohesion. These are contextual elements and mechanisms that need to be activated to enable critical reflection and community action to develop an enabling environment to address type 2 diabetes.

Examine price levels and price changes for originator and biosimilars, by country. Methods Retrospective quantitative analysis using insulin glargine pricing data, both of the originator product and its biosimilars. Segmented regression analysis using a dual-model approach: pooled and country-specific. Setting 28 European countries using data from the European Medicine Price Database for the period 2013–2023. Main outcome measures Price variations between countries were analysed to assess trends and correlations before and after biosimilar market entry. Results In the 28 countries studied, cost of insulin glargine underwent a median 21.6% decrease overall in the last decade (p<0.001). In 2022, the median price was €9.0 for the originator (first to market) Lantus (IQR €8.1–€10.4), €8.9 for the biosimilar Abasaglar (IQR €7.6–€10.1) and €7.0 for the biosimilar Semglee (median €7.0; IQR €6.8–€7.5). The originator price was higher than biosimilars (p=0.009). Biosimilar market entry was associated with an overall significant price reduction of the originator, both immediately after entry (p<0.001) and in the long-term postentry (p<0.001). No significant correlation was observed between the price of insulin and the countries’ economic indicators. Conclusion This is the first study to show the price trend of insulin glargine and its correlation with the introduction of biosimilars, in Europe. A significant price reduction of the originator was observed after biosimilars entered the market. The median cost of biosimilars was lower than the originator, although with substantial differences between individual countries and producers. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216987522,Biosimilar; European market; Market share

The present study aimed to determine the predictability of Pender's Health Promotion Model (HPM) constructs in T2D treatment adherence behaviour. Design The present cross-sectional and analytical study was conducted from November 2022 to January 2023. Setting The present study was conducted in Bandar Abbas, a city in Hormozgan Province, in the south of Iran. Participants The participants included 396 patients with T2D with medical records in the Hormoz Diabetes Clinic. Based on their record number, the participants were selected for inclusion in the study through a random systematic sampling. Primary and secondary outcome measures The data collection instruments included a demographic questionnaire and a researcher-made questionnaire based on HPM constructs. The questionnaire was valid and reliable, achieving Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.609 to 0.798 across various constructs. The questionnaires were completed face to face. Pearson's correlation test, path analysis and structural equation modelling were conducted using SPSS V.23, and STATA V.15. Study stage This study was conducted before intervention (pre-results). Results As the path analysis showed, perceived self-efficacy (β=0.23, p<0.001), treatment adherence experiences (β=0.26, p<0.001), immediate competing demands and preferences (β=-0.15, p<0.001) and commitment to plan of action (β=0.24, p<0.001) could significantly predict the treatment adherence behaviour. The results of indirect path analysis showed that the total effect of perceived benefits (β=0.24, p<0.001), perceived barriers (β=-0.14, p=0.002), perceived self-efficacy (β=0.32, p<0.001) on commitment to plan of action was statistically significant. Through the mediation of commitment to plan of action, they could predict the treatment adherence behaviour. Conclusions In light of the present findings, it can be concluded that the proposed model of T2D treatment adherence behaviour has an acceptable fit. Commitment to plan of action, treatment adherence experiences, perceived self-efficacy and immediate competing demands and preferences are the main predictors of T2D treatment adherence behaviour. It is recommended that educational interventions focus on these constructs. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212888119,Cross-sectional study; Stratified Sampling
Nakazawa S.; Fukai K.; Sano K.; Furuya Y.; Hoshi K.; Kojimahara N.; Toyota A.; Korenaga M.; Tatemichi M.,Association of occupational physical activity and sedentary behaviour with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: a case-control study based on the Inpatient Clinico-Occupational Database of Rosai Hospital Group,2025,BMJ Open,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-092020,"Objectives While there is growing evidence that physical activity reduces the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the impact of occupational physical activity and sedentary behaviour remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the associations between occupational physical activity and sedentary behaviour and HCC risk. Design Matched case-control study. Setting Nationwide multicentre, hospital-inpatient data set in Japan, from 2005 to 2021. Participants The study included 5625 inpatients diagnosed with HCC and 27 792 matched controls without liver disease or neoplasms. Participants were matched based on sex, age, admission date, and hospital. Primary measures The association between levels of occupational physical activity (low, medium, high) and sedentary time (short, medium, long) with the risk of HCC. Secondary measures Stratification of HCC risk by viral infection status (hepatitis B/C virus), alcohol consumption levels and the presence of metabolic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, obesity). Results High occupational physical activity was not associated with HCC caused by hepatitis B/C virus infection in men. In women, high occupational physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of non-viral HCC, with ORs (95% CIs) of 0.65 (0.45–0.93). Among patients with non-viral HCC, medium occupational physical activity combined with medium alcohol intake further decreased the HCC risk in men with an OR of 0.70 (0.50–0.97), while high occupational physical activity combined with lowest alcohol intake decreased the HCC risk in women with an OR of 0.69 (0.48–0.99). Men and women with medium sedentary time had a lower HCC risk compared with those with long sedentary time, with ORs of 0.88 (0.79–0.98) in men and 0.77 (0.62–0.97) in women, respectively. In patients without viral infection or alcohol use, medium sedentary time reduced the HCC risk associated with fatty liver disease without comorbid metabolic diseases in women. Conclusions High levels of occupational physical activity and/or medium periods of sedentary time are associated with a reduced risk of HCC, particularly non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

The original study examined the risk factors associated with hospitalisation following COVID-19 infection in people with diabetes. Design A replication of a retrospective cohort study. Setting Observational electronic health record data from primary and secondary care sources in the UK. The original study used data from a large, urbanised region (Greater Manchester Care Record, Greater Manchester, UK—2.8 m patients). This replication study used a national database covering the whole of England, UK (NHS England’s Secure Data Environment service for England, accessed via the BHF Data Science Centre’s CVD-COVID-UK/COVID-IMPACT Consortium—54 m patients). Participants Individuals with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes prior to a positive COVID-19 test result. The matched controls (3:1) were individuals who had a positive COVID-19 test result, but who did not have a diagnosis of diabetes on the date of their positive COVID-19 test result. Matching was done on age at COVID-19 diagnosis, sex and approximate date of COVID-19 test. Primary and secondary outcome measures Hospitalisation within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test. Results We found that many of the effect sizes did not show a statistically significant difference, but that some did. Where effect sizes were statistically significant in the regional study, then they remained significant in the national study and the effect size was the same direction and of similar magnitude. Conclusions There is some evidence that the findings from studies in smaller regional datasets can be extrapolated to a larger, national setting. However, there were some differences, and therefore replication studies remain an essential part of healthcare research. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003982049,Research Design
Alsaedi S.; Skogstad M.; Haugen F.,GLU24/7 study: Cardiometabolic health risk factors in night shift workers - Protocol for a 2-year longitudinal study in an industrial setting in Norway,2025,BMJ Open ,10.1136/bmjopen-2025-098896,"Introduction Evidence links night shift work to circadian rhythm disruption, causing hormonal and metabolic alterations, as well as increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study investigates whether night shift work affects blood glucose variability and dysregulation, potentially driven by circadian misalignment. It also examines whether such disruptions elevate inflammatory markers involved in atherosclerosis and contribute to the exacerbation of CVD risk markers. Methods and analysis The study includes 60 participants: rotating night shift workers (day, evening, and night shifts) and day workers (controls) at a pharmaceutical plant. We will assess the effects of night shift work on metabolic and cardiovascular health over three phases: an initial 6-week observational period (phase I), baseline registration of CVD risk factors (phase II), and follow-up assessment of CVD risk factors at 2 years (phase III). Phase I registrations include working hours derived from payroll data, sleep metrics by OURA ring (actigraphy, plethysmography and temperature), continuous assessments of blood glucose using continuous glucose monitor, self-reported food diary and measurements of circadian rhythm markers (monocyte mRNA expression). In phases II and III, blood CVD risk factors such as markers of inflammation, lipids, glycosylated haemoglobin, D-dimer, clinical examination of blood pressure, resting heart rate, arterial stiffness by the means of carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity, carotid intima-media thickness and maximal oxygen uptake (V˙O 2max) are measured. To this end, a comprehensive set of methods will be used in a prospective manner to provide new knowledge on shift work-induced glucose regulation and CVD risk factors. Ethics and dissemination All participants provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study, which will adhere to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval has been granted by the Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics South-East B (reference # 745702). Dissemination plans include academic and public publications, as well as collaborations with national and regional policy-makers.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004481280,Longitudinal Study
Waida E.; Wilkinson S.; Brauer M.,Evaluating the utility of texting in the ambulatory care of paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes: a quality improvement report,2025,BMJ Open Quality,10.1136/bmjoq-2024-003114,"Introduction Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic and costly disease that is often diagnosed in childhood. Achieving excellent glycaemic control during this period requires attention to multiple factors. Advances in technology now allow clients (patients/family members) to fine-tune their insulin delivery, necessitating support from highly skilled nurses, dietitians and physicians (clinicians). Despite quarterly team-based appointments, interim issues and questions often arise, and families may not always reach out for support. The incidence of T1D is rising, and yet barriers exist to expanding the clinical team. Additionally, clinicians are not necessarily colocated, making timely and efficient communication challenging. We postulated that offering texting as a communication modality would increase client interactions by 20%, and that clients and clinicians would find it a desirable tool in the delivery of efficient and timely ambulatory care. Methods A prospective interventional quality improvement project was conducted between July 2022 and August 2023. Baseline data were obtained for the number of interactions. Parents, caregivers and age-appropriate patients were then registered onto the texting platform (N=125) and received a weekly check-in message. The number of interactions and clinical time spent texting and providing care because of a text interaction were collected. Results There were approximately 30 interactions per week, an increase of >2300%. The average additional clinical time required was 56 min per week (average of 30 s/interaction). Qualitatively, 100% of our clients expressed a desire to continue texting with the team. 97% of clients felt that texting was an important way for them to contact their diabetes team. Our clinicians also wished to continue texting, valuing the improved efficiency of communication and experiencing a greater degree of connection with their clients. Conclusions Texting is a welcome modality of communication between clients and their clinical care team in the setting of ambulatory T1D care, resulting in increased engagement. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002535266,Interim
Gilholm P.; Raman S.; Irwin A.; Lister P.; Harley A.; Schlapbach L.J.; Gibbons K.S.,Identification of distinct clinical profiles of sepsis risk in paediatric emergency department patients using Bayesian profile regression,2025,BMJ Paediatrics Open,10.1136/bmjpo-2024-003100,"Background Sepsis affects 25 million children and neonates annually, causing significant mortality and morbidity. Early identification and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes. Identifying children at risk is challenging due to clinical heterogeneity and overlap with other conditions. Current evaluations of sepsis criteria adopt a variable-centred approach, evaluating each criterion independently. The objective of this study was to explore associations between patterns of sepsis screening criteria and sepsis risk in children screened in the emergency department (ED) to identify distinct profiles that describe the clinical heterogeneity of suspected sepsis. Methods This secondary analysis involved 3473 children screened for sepsis across 12 EDs in Queensland, Australia. Bayesian profile regression was used to construct data-driven clinical profiles derived from sepsis screening criteria and their association with suspected sepsis, defined as senior medical officer diagnosis and antibiotic administration in the ED. Posterior risk probabilities (Prs) with 95% credible intervals (CIs) were calculated for each profile. Profiles were internally validated by assessing their association with sepsis, septic shock, organ dysfunction and infection sources, in both adjusted and unadjusted models. Results Seven distinct clinical profiles were identified. Two profiles were labelled as high risk of suspected sepsis (profile 1, n=22: Pr 0.73, 95% CI 0.55, 0.89; profile 2, n=150: Pr 0.69, 95% CI 0.59, 0.80), four as moderate risk and one as low risk. High-risk profiles were characterised by severe illness indicators and elevated lactate levels. Moderate-risk profiles included criteria such as altered behaviour, young age (<3 months) and respiratory distress. High-risk profiles had strong associations with all clinical outcomes. Conclusions Seven clinical profiles were identified that varied in their risk of suspected sepsis and associated outcomes. Validation of these profiles in diverse populations and identification of which profiles are likely to benefit from certain interventions is needed. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007744949,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

However, the PTPRDexpressing hepatic cell types, signalling pathways responsive to PTPRD and their role in non-viral liver disease are largely unknown. Methods We studied PTPRD expression in single-cell and bulk liver transcriptomic data from mice and humans, and established a Ptprd-deficient mouse model for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Identified pathways were validated by perturbation studies in human hepatocytes and PTPRD substrates by pull-down assays. The clinical relevance was further explored in a cohort with metabolic disease by ranking patients according to PTPRD expression and analysing its association with metabolic disease markers. Results The analysis of individuals ranked according to PTPRD expression and Ptprd-deficient mice, showed that PTPRD levels were associated with hepatic glucose/ lipid signalling and peroxisome function. Hepatic PTPRD expression is impaired in aetiologies of chronic liver diseases that are associated with metabolic disease. We further validated PTPRD as a STAT3 phosphatase in the liver, acting as a regulator of peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism. During MASH, low PTPRD led to increased liver steatosis in Ptprd+/− mice and a pronounced unfolded protein response, which impacts insulin signalling. Accordingly, silencing of PTPRD blunted insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation. Patients with obesity and low hepatic PTPRD expression exhibit increased levels of metabolic risk factors. Conclusion Our data revealed an important regulatory role of the hepatic PTPRD-STAT3 axis in maintaining glucose/lipid homeostasis, which is recapitulated in clinical manifestations of metabolic liver disease. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

While PNI has been shown to be a significant prognostic tool in gastrointestinal surgery and heart failure, its role in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate whether PNI can serve as a meaningful risk factor for patients undergoing CABG. Methods This observational retrospective analysis involved a substantial sample of 2889 patients who underwent isolated CABG at one of four medical centres. The primary outcomes included short- and long-term mortality. Perioperative serum albumin levels and total lymphocyte counts used to calculate PNIs were collected 48 hours before the operation, 24 hours after the operation and at discharge. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors of short-term mortality. Survival and relative risks were assessed using Cox regression analysis and the Kaplan-Meier test. Results Among the 2889 patients, 64 (2.2%) died within 30 days following CABG. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that higher preoperative PNI was independently associated with reduced short-term mortality (OR=0.852 per unit increase, 95% CI 0.802 to 0.904, p<0.001). Regarding long-term outcomes, among the 2825 patients who were discharged alive, 199 deaths occurred over a median follow-up period of 54.9 months. Patients with a normal PNI at discharge (>40) exhibited significantly higher long-term survival rates compared with those with a lower PNI (≤40) (log-rank p=0.003). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that a normal PNI at discharge(>40) independently predicted a lower risk of long-term all-cause mortality (HR=0.718, 95% CI 0.529 to 0.974, p=0.033). Conclusions PNI at various time points may play a crucial predictive role in mortality among CABG-treated patients, and a low PNI serves as a risk factor for both short- and long-term survival. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218108429,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We aimed to assess primary care adherence to guideline-recommended standards for patients with overlapping HF, CKD and T2D in England. Methods Using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1998-2020), we evaluated care adherence across 161 529 individuals with HF, CKD or T2D before and after developing a second of these conditions. We analysed disease investigation rates, medication use and predictors of guideline adherence. Results We identified 161 529 patients with CKD followed by HF (CKD+HF, 40%), CKD+T2D (51.3%) and HF+T2D (8.6%) with a median of 3.1 years follow-up after the second diagnosis. In CKD+HF, CKD+T2D and HF+T2D groups, prescription rates of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (71%, 64.1% and 74.4%), beta-blockers (53.1%,36.2% and 55.1%), antiplatelets (56.2%, 45.2% and 54.4%) and statins (56.7%, 68.5% and 72%) were suboptimal. Advanced age, female sex, peripheral arterial disease and cancer were associated with a lower likelihood of checking blood pressure, creatinine and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) after HF, CKD and T2D diagnoses, respectively. The first diagnosis of HF was associated with reduced odds of having HbA1C measured after T2D diagnosis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.86), compared with CKD as the first diagnosis. Conclusions In overlapping HF, CKD and T2D, guideline-recommended care is suboptimal, with inequalities by age, sex, disease on first presentation and comorbidities.

Alenzi F.; Aljohani R.; Aboabat A.; Alanazi F.; Almalag H.M.; Omair M.A.,Systematic review of the reporting of extrarenal manifestations in observational studies of Saudi patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,2025,Lupus Science and Medicine,10.1136/lupus-2024-001469,"Background SLE is prevalent in Saudi Arabia, with numerous studies focusing on SLE in adult patients. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies summarising the extrarenal manifestations of SLE in this population. This study aims to assess the variability in the prevalence rates of extrarenal manifestations of SLE across different cities in Saudi Arabia and to emphasise the need for a national registry to better understand the overall disease burden in the region. Methods We conducted a systematic review of articles with no time restrictions, including studies from databases such as Medline, ScienceDirect, EBSCO and PubMed up to July 2024. The review process involved screening, data extraction and quality assessment in duplicate. Only observational or experimental studies focusing on extrarenal manifestations in adult patients with SLE in Saudi Arabia were included. The review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist for systematic reviews to ensure a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Results A total of 35 studies were included, primarily retrospective cohort studies. Riyadh showed the highest number of publications over time. Musculoskeletal involvement in SLE ranged from 2% to 100%, with most studies reporting 46%-85%. Mucocutaneous manifestations, including discoid rash (5%-100%), malar rash (up to 79%) and photosensitivity (6.12%-29.3%), varied widely. Raynaud's phenomenon was noted at 4.5%-15.2%. Constitutional symptoms were more common in early-onset SLE, while serositis and cardiopulmonary issues showed variability. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially depression, reached up to 67.6%. Conclusion This study explores the prevalence of extrarenal manifestations of SLE among adult Saudi patients, highlighting significant regional variability in musculoskeletal, dermatological, cardiovascular and neurological symptoms. It addresses a gap in the literature for a region where autoimmune diseases are a growing public health concern. The findings emphasise the need for population-based studies to investigate environmental, genetic and lifestyle factors influencing SLE progression.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000425738,Mucocutaneous zone; Serositis

We used data from the Trends in Scottish Veterans Health cohort to explore the risk of hospitalisation and death associated with COVID-19 in veterans resident in Scotland in comparison with matched non-veterans. Methods Retrospective cohort study of 71 000 veterans and a comparison group of 230 000 non-veterans matched for age, sex and geography, using Cox proportional hazard analysis to explore the risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 and COVID-19-associated death overall and by birth cohort, sex and length of military service. Results Between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021, 564 (0.79%) veterans had been hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with 1728 (0.75%) non-veterans. The Cox model showed no significant difference overall, HR 0.99, 95% CIs 0.90 to 1.11, p=0.800. Subgroup analysis showed increased risk in older, short-serving (<20 weeks) Early Service Leavers (ESL). There was no overall difference in COVID-19-associated deaths, HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23, p=0.993, but subgroup analysis showed a non-significant reduced risk of death in veterans aged 61-70 years, and a 38% higher risk in veterans aged over 70 years which almost reached statistical significance, p=0.054. This was only partially explained by socioeconomic factors and common comorbidities, although we had no data on domestic circumstances or care home residence. Conclusions Overall, military service was not a risk factor for either hospitalisation or death associated with COVID-19. Older ESLs were at increased risk compared with non-veterans, but military service is unlikely to have been causal. The risk of death was increased in the oldest veterans and further studies are needed to explain this once census data become available for linkage.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192718279,Pandemic; Subgroup analysis; Veterans Affairs

Outcomes included 30-day medical complications, 30-day wound complications, return to the operating room, nonhome discharge, and extended postoperative length of stay. Bivariate t-tests and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted. For any outcome-laboratory value pairs with significance on regression, area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were constructed. Results: A total of 1440 patients with albumin, 3138 patients with hematocrit, and 3159 patients with creatinine levels were identified. Increased serum albumin was associated with lower odds of medical complications (aOR: 0.479, p = 0.035). An overall cohort cutoff of ≤ 3.5 g/dL (AUC: 0.79, p < 0.001) was predictive of medical complications. On multivariate logistic regression, increased hematocrit reduced the odds of medical complications (aOR: 0.889, p < 0.001). Predictive hematocrit cutoffs of ≤ 39.7% (AUC: 0.77, p < 0.001) and ≤ 36.6% (AUC: 0.74, p < 0.001) were identified for medical complications amongst male and female patients, respectively. Similarly, increased serum creatinine was associated with greater odds of medical complications (aOR: 1.684, p = 0.006). Creatinine cutoffs of ≥ 1.2 mg/dL (AUC: 0.58, p = 0.033) and ≥ 1.0 mg/dL (AUC: 0.59, p = 0.039) were identified for medical complications amongst male and female patients, respectively. Conclusions: Multiple preoperative serum values were predictive of postoperative medical complications, and laboratory value thresholds were identified in this carpal tunnel decompression cohort to aid in risk stratification.

Ye J.; Bounds A.; Crumpton M.; Long M.; McDonough H.; Srikhirisawan I.; Gao S.,Potential Mechanisms of Lactate Dehydrogenase and Bovine Serum Albumin Proteins as Antioxidants: A Mixed Experimental–Computational Study,2025,Biochemistry Research International,10.1155/bri/9638644,"Proteins have shown varying degrees of antioxidant activity. This study examined the potential mechanisms of interactions between proteins and radicals using chemical kinetics and computational methods. The study quantified the antioxidant activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) through Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. BSA was about seven times and LDH 12 times more potent as antioxidants for 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS•−) than they were for peroxyl radicals. According to the evaluation of Trolox equivalents (TE) of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, tryptophan (with a TE value of 101 μmol TE/μmol) exhibited the highest antioxidant activity for ABTS•−, followed by tyrosine (38.7 μmol TE/μmol) and cysteine (30.5 μmol TE/μmol), lysine (0.193 μmol TE/μmol), arginine (0.0325 μmol TE/μmol), valine (0.0280 μmol TE/μmol), histidine (0.00689 μmol TE/μmol), and leucine (0.00560 μmol TE/μmol). The EC50 showed a similar order with a swap between valine and histidine. The antioxidant activity of the amino acids and proteins was temperature dependent. The rate laws, activation energy, and pre-exponential factor A of these reactions provided information on the reaction mechanisms, i.e., a biomolecular elementary step for the reaction of ABTS•− with amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, cysteine, or protein LDH, and a more complicated mechanism for BSA. The presence of –NH– or hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings enhanced the antioxidant ability of tryptophan and tyrosine. LDH’s antioxidant activity did not affect its enzymatic activity, indicating that the radical reaction likely happened on the protein’s surface without significantly altering its conformation. The molecular modeling and visualization showed potential reaction sites on the proteins’ accessible tryptophan and tyrosine residues. However, the mere surface exposure of tryptophan and tyrosine does not guarantee their antioxidant activities. Copyright © 2025 Jing Ye et al.

Further evaluation revealed neutropenia, impaired platelet function, pulmonary fibrosis, and mild pulmonary hypertension. An ECG identified ventricular pre-excitation with a postero-septal right accessory pathway, consistent with Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome. Genetic testing confirmed a homozygous mutation in the AP3B1 gene and a diagnosis of Type 2 HPS (HPS-2) was made. HPS-2 is an extremely rare disorder, and to our knowledge, the co-occurrence of WPW syndrome has not been previously reported in literature. We propose a potential causal link between these two conditions, as mutations in the AP3B1 gene—which encodes the beta subunit of the adapter protein 3 trafficking complex—result in mistrafficking of transmembrane proteins from the endosomal and trans-Golgi network to lysosomes and endosome–lysosome-related organelles. Specifically, the dysfunction of a transmembrane protein, namely the lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2), has been implicated in the development of cardiac accessory pathways, as seen in Danon disease. We hypothesize that individuals with HPS-2 may have a genetic predisposition to WPW syndrome, and this hypothesis should be investigated in further studies. Copyright © 2025 Riccardo Alcidi et al.

Takeuchi H.; Iso-O N.; Takai A.; Mikamo T.; Nagumo K.; Hara M.,An Adult Case of Diabetes With High Levels of GAD Antibodies Without Insulin Deficiency for More Than 10 Years,2025,Case Reports in Endocrinology,10.1155/crie/9712659,"Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or slowly progressive insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (SPIDDM) is a form of autoimmune diabetes characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to deficient insulin secretion. Here, we report a case of diabetes and obesity in a 56-year-old woman. She was diagnosed with severe obesity, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and a positive antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) test result at the age of 39 years. She developed diabetes 7 years later, meeting the diagnostic criteria for SPIDDM (probable). Despite high GADA levels, her endogenous insulin secretion has been preserved for over a decade. GADA has been regarded as a marker of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, and high levels of GADA are considered a risk factor for future insulin deficiency. However, the role of GADA in its pathogenesis remains unclear. GADA is not a specific indicator of autoimmune diabetes, as it is also positive for autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) and stiff-person syndrome. Therefore, a positive GADA test alone is not sufficient to predict insulin deficiency in an individual case, even if the titer is high. In the early stages, autoimmune diabetes presents clinical features similar to those of type 2 diabetes, particularly obesity. Although insulin therapy is often started early in the treatment of autoimmune diabetes, as the consensus statement indicates, when endogenous insulin secretion is preserved and the risk of insulin deficiency is low, efforts should be made to prevent body weight gain and the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) by following treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes, with the exception of the use of sulfonylurea agents.

Kalan Sarı I.; Keskin O.; Seremet Keskin A.,The Effect of Diabetes Mellitus and Glycemic Parameters on the Prognosis of COVID-19 Disease,2025,International Journal of Clinical Practice,10.1155/ijcp/5566405,"Studies show that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is more severe in people with diabetes. Although diabetes has been shown to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease, the relationship between fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with mortality and prognosis in COVID-19 is still controversial. We designed this study to investigate the impact of diabetes on the prognosis of COVID-19 and to show the relationship between FBG and HbA1c and COVID-19 mortality. In this study, patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in the COVID-19 Ward of the Department of Chest Diseases and Intensive Care Unit of Antalya Research and Training Hospital between December 2019 and December 2021 were included. The patients’ demographic data, treatment and laboratory results, developing complications, and clinical outcomes were extracted from their electronic medical records. The mortality of patients with diabetes was significantly higher than that of patients without diabetes (p : 0.0001). The duration of hospitalization, the development of complications, and the need for oxygen, antibiotics, and steroids were higher in patients with diabetes than in patients without diabetes (p : 0.0001). C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fibrinogen, which are associated with poor prognosis in studies, were higher in patients with diabetes (p : 0.0001). When comparing discharged and deceased patients with diabetes, HbA1c was higher in discharged patients and FBG was higher in deceased patients (p : 0.003 and p : 0.030, respectively). Our study confirms the finding that COVID-19 patients with diabetes have a poor prognosis and mortality. It also shows that FBG level is related to COVID-19 mortality. Contrary to some studies, the low detection of HbA1c in deceased patients may indicate that initial blood glucose rather than glycemic control prior to infection, is associated with COVID-19 mortality. The influence of HbA1c and FBG on COVID-19 prognosis could be investigated in larger studies. Copyright © 2025 Işılay Kalan Sarı et al.

Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted, and patients with a proven hemoglobinopathy diagnosis were included. Fasting blood was obtained to measure creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, uric acid, and ferritin. In addition, a 24-h urine specimen was collected to determine the level of urine albumin, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, uric acid, and β2-microglobulin. Fractional excretion of sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and uric acid was also calculated. Spearman’s coefficient of correlation was used to determine the correlations between serum ferritin level and other variables. Results: Of the sixty-six patients studied, 3.0% had sickle cell thalassemia, 80.3% had major thalassemia, and 72.7% had intermediate thalassemia. In our study, serum ferritin, 24-h urine protein, and fractional excretion of sodium, calcium, and urine were higher than the normal range in thalassemia patients. There was a significant correlation between serum ferritin level and fractional excretion of magnesium, calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and uric acid with a negative correlation coefficient (p ≤ 0.05). We also found that the serum ferritin levels strongly correlated with microalbuminuria (p ≤ 0.05). Copyright © 2025 Mohammad Tammadondar et al.

Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 150 T2DKD patients in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 2018 to December 2021. All patients received short-term CSII treatment and achieved the blood glucose target by adjusting insulin infusion. The patients’ daily insulin requirements during the treatment were recorded and analyzed. Result: There were 91 males and 59 females with an average age of 60.6 ± 10.6 years. Total daily insulin dose (TDD), total daily insulin dose per kilogram (TDD kg−1), total basal insulin dose per kilogram (TBa kg−1), and total bolus insulin dose per kilogram (TBo kg−1) fell with the decline of eGFR when achieving the blood glucose target except for the ratio of total basal insulin dose (TBD) to TDD (%TBa). Insulin requirement was less in patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.05). When achieving the blood glucose target, eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 group and eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 group were 0.71 ± 0.19 U/kg and 0.60 ± 0.24 U/kg, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that glycated hemoglobin and eGFR were independent factors associated with TDD kg−1. Conclusion: In patients with T2DKD who received short-term CSII therapy, the insulin requirement decline with the decrease of eGFR, while the %TBa did not change significantly. The dosage of insulin should be adjusted according to the level of eGFR in patients with T2DKD treated with CSII. Copyright © 2025 Qianqiu Feng et al.

Lora-Escobar S.J.; Rodríguez-de Francisco L.; López-Feijoo M.; Santos-Ramos B.; Bellido V.; Casado-Mejía R.; Acosta-García H.,Gender Bias in Clinical Trials of Sodium–Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review,2025,Journal of Diabetes Research,10.1155/jdr/3733178,"Aims: The study is aimed at assessing gender bias in Phase III clinical trials (CTs) of sodium–glucose cotransporter type 2 (iSGLT2) inhibitors in adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases until June 2023. To estimate sex bias in recruitment, the difference between F-Particip (fraction of women recruited) and F-Prev (prevalence fraction of women with T2DM) was calculated. A significant sex bias in recruitment was considered to exist when the difference between F-Particip and F-Prev was greater than 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2. The analysis was considered to have a sex bias when the efficacy variables were not analyzed by sex. Gender of the first, last, and corresponding author was also assessed. Results: In total, 70 articles met all inclusion criteria. Sex bias in recruitment showed variable results depending on the reference value. No significant sex bias in recruitment was found in the total number of included patients. Examining each CT individually, using values of significant sex bias in recruitment of ±0.05, ±0.1, or ±0.2, we found that 41.4%, 20%, and 5.7% of the trials, respectively, showed this bias. In 34.3% of the articles, women were the first, last, or corresponding authors. Sex-based analysis of the results was performed in five studies. Conclusions: Although the proportion of women included in iSGLT2 CTs seems acceptable, gender bias persists in the analysis of variables and in the study authors. However, the lack of gender focus may be explained by the characteristics of the patients included in the CTs. Copyright © 2025 Santiago José Lora-Escobar et al.

Niu S.; Li R.; Yuan L.; Huang D.,Associations Between Self-Stigma and Health Promotion Behaviors in Overweight/Obese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Cross-Sectional Study,2025,Journal of Diabetes Research,10.1155/jdr/9142949,"Background: Patients experiencing stigma are more prone to engage in unhealthy behaviors. The correlation between stigma and health-promoting behaviors in overweight/obese T2DM patients is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between the two in this particular population. Methods: This cross-sectional study, conducted from July 2022 to July 2023 at the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism of a tertiary general hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China, used convenience sampling to enroll overweight/obese T2DM patients. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Respondents were assessed for stigma and health-promoting behaviors using the SSCI and T2DHPS scales. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 27.0, with a significance level of p < 0.05. Results: The majority was males (64%). The average BMI of patients was 27.27 ± 3.11 (kg/m2), and the average HbA1c was 8.36 ± 1.81 (mmol/mol). The overall stigma score of overweight/obese T2DM patients was 4.19 ± 8.69, and the overall health-promoting behaviors score was 87.75 ± 16.75. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between stigma and the overall score of health promotion behaviors (r = −0.144, p < 0.05). The multiple linear regression analysis showed that the hypoglycemia incidence, patient origin, GLP-1RA use, and stress management explained 23.9% of the patients’ feelings of stigma. Conclusions: This study found that there was a correlation between the level of stigma and health-promoting behaviors in overweight/obese patients with T2DM. Hypoglycemia, inpatient, GLP-1RA treatment, and stress management significantly predicted stigma among overweight/obese patients. These findings have implications for healthcare providers, as they can develop intervention strategies by assessing the levels of stigma and stress management in overweight/obese patients with T2DM, to help reduce stigma and promote healthy behaviors among these patients.

Although many drugs have certain therapeutic effects, they still produce some side effects. Therefore, this article chooses the natural medicinal plant mulberry leaves to reveal its mechanism of regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. By establishing an insulin resistance model and a 3T3-L1 adipocyte model, it was found that mulberry leaf extract (MLE) and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) significantly increased glucose consumption and glycogen consumption, while reducing total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Network pharmacology, molecular docking, and protein level showed that MLE and DNJ could improve glucose and lipid metabolism disorders through IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These results suggest that MLE and DNJ may have broad application prospects in regulating glycolipid metabolism in functional foods and healthcare products. Copyright © 2025 Yin-Di Zhang et al.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complication in malaria-infected individuals with a high mortality rate (80% to 100%) and can occur before, during, or after antimalarial drug treatment. Although inflammation and epithelial/endothelial injury pathways have been determined through these studies, specific circulating malaria-associated ARDS markers have not yet been established. We applied a quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approach to identify altered molecular pathways in a mouse model of malaria-associated ARDS. Acute-phase response (APR) proteins were regulated in the ARDS group, suggesting their potential involvement in the development of the syndrome. They may serve as biomarkers when analyzed alongside other proteins that require further investigation. Additionally, the regulation of APR proteins in the ARDS group provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of ARDS, contributing to a better understanding of the syndrome.

Objectives: To compare the clinical presentation, biochemical parameters, and precipitating factors of DKA in adult patients with T1DM and T2DM. Methodology: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at King Salman Hospital, Riyadh, involving medical records of diabetic patients aged 14 years or older who attended the Diabetic Center from September 1, 2021, to August 1, 2022. Data collection included sociodemographic, clinical, biochemical, and management details using a standardized checklist. Results: The study included 285 patients with DKA, aged 14–70 years (mean: 23.1 ± 11.5 years), with 52.5% being male. The most common symptoms were nausea (91.1%), abdominal pain (86.1%), vomiting (83.6%), polyuria/polydipsia (74.1%), and shortness of breath (72.4%). Vomiting and abdominal pain were more frequent in T1DM (85.9% and 88.3%) compared to T2DM (65.6% and 68.8%), p = 0.004 and 0.003, respectively, while dizziness was more common in T2DM (56.3% vs. 33.2%), p = 0.011. Uric acid and creatinine levels were significantly higher in T2DM, whereas hemoglobin and hematocrit were elevated in T1DM. Poor compliance was the most common precipitating factor (70.2%), followed by upper respiratory tract infection (21.1%) and inadequate treatment (15.6%). Conclusion: This study highlights key differences in DKA presentation between T1DM and T2DM. While symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain were common in both types, vomiting was more frequent in T1DM and dizziness in T2DM. Biochemical markers such as uric acid and creatinine were elevated in T2DM, while hemoglobin and hematocrit were higher in T1DM. Poor compliance was a more common precipitating factor in T1DM, whereas inadequate treatment prevailed in T2DM. Tailored management approaches for each diabetes type may improve DKA outcomes.

Notably, the 0–4-year-old age group saw the most significant annual increase, at 9.3%. Objective: This study aims to determine the incidence and trends of T1DM among Estonian children from 1983 to 2022, focusing on the period from 2007 to 2022. Additionally, the study evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of T1DM in this population. Subjects and Methods: This retrospective cohort study gathered data from 2007 to 2022 using population-based registries from Estonia’s paediatric medical centers. Preceding data were sourced from previous publications. The subjects were divided into three age groups, and the study period was segmented into five time periods, each spanning 8 years. Results: From 2007 to 2022, 1104 new T1DM cases were diagnosed in children under 15 years in Estonia, with a crude IR of 32.9 per 100,000 persons per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.9–34.8). The highest incidence was in the 10–14-year age group (40.5 per 100,000 per year) (95% CI 36.7–44.3). On average, the incidence grew by 1.6% during this time period for all age groups combined. The most significant growth was in the 5–9-year-old group, with an annual increase of 2.9% (relative risk [RR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.0–1.5). The highest IR ever recorded in Estonia was in 2021, during the highest fatality year of COVID-19, at 45.8 per 100,000 (95% CI 26.9–54.8). Conclusions: The incidence of childhood-onset T1DM in Estonia continues to rise, with a notable spike in 2021 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright © 2025 Sonja Mattson et al.

Insulin icodec is a novel basal insulin designed for once-weekly administration. Methods: This study investigated the pharmacokinetic properties of icodec in children and adolescents with T2D aged 10 to < 18 years. Eighteen insulin-treated (daily basal insulin dose ≥ 0.2 U/kg) participants (11 females/7 males; mean ± standard deviation body mass index 38.5 ± 7.1 kg/m2, HbA1c 7.5 ± 1.3%) received a single subcutaneous injection of icodec (5.6 U/kg). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were drawn frequently until 35 days postinjection. Observed single-dose pharmacokinetic profiles were extrapolated to steady state using pharmacokinetic modeling. Results: One-week icodec pharmacokinetic profiles observed after a single dose and extrapolated to steady state suggest that icodec exposure covers the full weekly dosing interval in children and adolescents with T2D. After a single dose, geometric mean total exposure was 819∙105 pmol∙h/L [coefficient of variation (CV) 28.2%] and maximum concentration (Cmax) was 4.22∙105 pmol/L (CV 25.8%). Median time to maximum concentration (tmax) was 21 h (range 12–27 h). When extrapolated to steady state, geometric mean total exposure was 771∙105 pmol∙h/L (CV 29.9%) and maximum concentration was 6.35∙105 pmol/L (CV 27.3%). Median tmax was 15 h (range 13–19 h). In total, six adverse events (AEs) were reported in two participants. All AEs were mild and recovered/resolved. No serious or severe AEs, hypersensitivity or injection site reactions, or hyperglycemic episodes (plasma glucose > 14.0 mmol/L and blood ketones > 1.5 mmol/L) were reported. One level 1 hypoglycemic episode (plasma glucose < 3.9 and ≥ 3.0 mmol/L) was reported. Conclusion: Icodec was safe and well-tolerated in the current study in children and adolescents with T2D. The pharmacokinetic properties of icodec support its potential for once-weekly administration in children and adolescents with T2D. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05790681.

There is concern that unequal access to technologies, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), may increase disparities. This systematic review summarises the evidence for inequalities in the prevalence of CGM use for children and young people (CYP) and outcomes for CGM users. Methods: Medline, Embase and Web of Science were searched for observational studies published between January 2020 and July 2023 which report CGM use stratified by any PROGRESS-Plus criteria for T1D patients under 26. Reports based in low- or middle-income countries, ≤500 participants or only reporting hybrid closed-loop systems were excluded. Primary outcomes were the proportion of patients using CGM and HbA1c of CGM users. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Unadjusted odds ratios were calculated from the extracted summary data, though heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. The protocol was preregistered with PROSPERO (CRD42023438139). Results: Of the 3369 unique studies identified, 27 met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-three percent were of ‘good’ or ‘very good’ quality. We found decreased CGM use and higher discontinuation for low SES, low education, publicly insured and minority ethnic, especially Black, CYP. These associations were generally robust to adjustment for other sociodemographic variables, suggesting an independent effect. Lower SES inequalities were seen in countries where CGM is reimbursed. Although low SES and minority ethnicity were associated with poorer outcomes in general, for CGM users there was no significant association between domains of disadvantage and higher HbA1c, excepting parental education. Conclusions: There are significant SES, ethnic and education inequalities in CGM use for CYP with T1D, particularly when reimbursement is limited. This inequity is contributing to inequalities in T1D outcomes. However, evidence suggests CYP benefit equally from CGM use, irrespective of ethnicity and SES. Increasing CGM funding and use is likely to reduce outcome inequalities. Copyright © 2025 James Howard Dicks et al.

Among these MSCs, multilineage-differentiating stress enduring (Muse) cells are reported to be effective in mouse models. The present study investigated the safety and effectiveness of Muse cell transplantation in large animal models of hepatic fibrosis. Methods: Muse cells and MSC were prepared from bone marrow cells of male mini pigs (Göttingen strain). Recipients mini pigs (female Göttingen strain) were repeatedly administered with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) intraperitoneally for 12 weeks to induce liver fibrosis. Thereafter, either Muse cells or MSCs were transplanted intravenously. After the cell transplantation, laboratory tests, vital signs, and liver histology were evaluated (Muse cell group (n = 6), MSC group (n = 6), and vehicle group (n = 7)). Results: Liver fibrogenesis was successfully induced after 12 weeks of CCl4 administration. Engraftment of transplanted cells and differentiation into hepatocytes were confirmed in recipients’ liver. In Muse cell group, significant increase of serum albumin (Alb) level was observed at 4 weeks compared to those of control groups (p < 0.05). Hepatic proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive cells were significantly increased in the Muse cell group (p < 0.05). Hepatic fibrogenesis at 12 weeks after transplantation were significantly improved in Muse cell group (p < 0.05). Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) immunostaining revealed significant decrease in liver from Muse cell transplanted recipients. No serious adverse effects were observed. Conclusions: Muse cell transplantation was safe and effective in large animal models of hepatic fibrosis. The positive effects were observed in namely 4 weeks after transplantation. Since biochemical as well as histological improvements were demonstrated, future studies including establishing ideal administration protocol seem to be feasible as a preclinical study.

However, ICB is largely ineffective in desert-type gastric cancer due to intrinsic tumor heterogeneity and a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Transforming tumors from an immunosuppressive state to an immunostimulatory state is a potential approach to enhance ICB response. In this study, we developed a chromosomal instability–subtype gastric cancer mouse model with an immunoactive TME and a stem cell–originated mouse-derived allograft model with an immunosuppressed TME to investigate mechanisms regulating the tumor immunophenotype and uncover therapeutic strategies to remodel the TME. Blocking β-catenin signaling attenuated the immunochemotherapeutic resistance of mouse-derived allograft tumors. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor apatinib reprogrammed the TME by increasing CD8+ T-cell and IGHA+ plasma cell infiltration and decreasing M2 macrophages, but apatinib also induced PD-L1 and CD80 expression in both human and mouse desert–type tumors. Oxaliplatin decreased the apatinib-induced expression of immune checkpoints and enhanced the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapy. A prospective clinical trial (NCT04195828) demonstrated that a neoadjuvant regimen of apatinib plus ICB and chemotherapy was effective in patients with desert-type gastric cancer. Collectively, these findings identify potential drug targets for immune desert–type gastric cancer driven by β-catenin signaling. ©2025 The Authors.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007067095,Apatinib; Cancer Immunotherapy

We conducted a phase I study of TTI-101, a first-in-class, selective small-molecule inhibitor of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, in patients with advanced metastatic cancer. Patients and Methods: Patients were treated with TTI-101 orally twice daily in 28-day cycles at four dose levels (DL): 3.2 (DL1), 6.4 (DL2), 12.8 (DL3), and 25.6 (DL4) mg/kg/day (“3+3” design). Three TTI-101 formulations were used in a stepwise manner (NCT03195699). Results: Sixty-four patients were treated (median age, 63 years; male sex, 52%; median number of prior therapies, 3). No dose-limiting toxicities or fatal treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were observed. Diarrhea (mostly grade 1/2) was the only TRAE observed in ≥30% of subjects. Five patients experienced grade 3 TRAEs that resolved. TTI-101 showed linear pharmacokinetics from DL1 to DL3, with the pharmacokinetics plateauing at DL3. The recommended phase II dose is 12.8 mg/kg/day (DL3). Of the 41 patients who were evaluable for response, five (12%) had confirmed partial responses (cPR) and 17 (41%) had stable disease. Three (18%) of the 17 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had a cPR (median time to treatment failure, 10.6 months). Two other cPRs were noted in one patient with ovarian cancer and one patient with gastric cancer. Conclusions: TTI-101 was well tolerated. cPRs were observed across tumor types. The antitumor activity of TTI-101 monotherapy in patients with advanced, metastatic solid tumors is promising.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-Evans blue–FAP inhibitor (177Lu-LNC1004) radioligand therapy (RLT) for treating end-stage metastatic tumors. Patients and Methods: This single-arm, single-center, phase II trial included 28 patients with progressive metastatic malignancies (11 types) and high FAP expression (defined as a maximum standardized uptake value ≥10 in >50% of tumors) who had exhausted all approved therapies, screened between June 2022 and April 2024. Patients were scheduled to receive four 177Lu-LNC1004 RLT cycles at 3.33 GBq/cycle every 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was post-RLT radiologic response. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), dosimetry, and safety. Results: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scores >2 were observed in 68% of patients. Overall, 63 177Lu-LNC1004 RLT cycles were performed, with 19 (68%) patients undergoing ≥2 cycles. Disease control was achieved in 13 (13/28, 46%) patients, with 4 and 9 patients demonstrating partial response and stable disease, respectively, and associated with improved PFS and OS (P < 0.001). The mean absorbed dose in tumors was 4.69 ± 3.83 Gy/GBq (1.18–25.03 Gy/GBq). Treatment-related grade 3/4 hematotoxicity was observed in six (21%) patients, with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and neutropenia most prevalent. No grade 3/4 hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity was observed. Conclusions: FAP-directed RLT using 177Lu-LNC1004 at 3.33 GBq/cycle was well tolerated with an acceptable toxicity profile. Nearly half of patients achieved disease control, which was associated with prolonged PFS and OS. ©2025 The Authors.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003610408,Radioligand; Single Center

However, EPR-mediated tumor uptake and distribution vary by cancer phenotype. Thus, we hypothesized that a companion PET imaging surrogate may benefit EPR-mediated therapeutic drug delivery. We developed two 89Zr-radiolabeled nanocarriers based on 4-armed starPEG40kDa with or without talazoparib (TLZ), a potent PARP inhibitor, as surrogates for the PEG-TLZ4 therapeutic scaffold. For PET imaging, PEG-DFB4 and PEG-DFB1 -TLZ3 were radiolabeled with 89Zr by replacing one or all four copis of TLZ on PEG-TLZ4 with deferoxamine B (DFB). The radiolabeled nanodrugs [89Zr]PEG-DFB4 and [89Zr]PEG-DFB1 -TLZ3 were tested in vivo in prostate cancer subcutaneous (s.c.) xenografts (22Rv1, LTL-545, and LTL-610) and 22Rv1 metastatic models. Their EPR-mediated tumoral uptake and penetration was compared with CT26, a known EPR-high cell line. MicroPET/CT images, organ biodistribution, and calculated kinetic parameters showed high uptake in CT26 and LTL-545 and moderate to low uptake in LTL-610 and 22Rv1. MicroPET/CT and high-resolution autoradiographic images showed nanocarrier penetration into highly permeable CT26, but heterogeneous peripheral accumulation was observed in LTL-545, LTL-610, and 22Rv1 s.c. xenografts and metastatic tumors. CD31 staining of tumor sections showed homogenous vascular development in CT26 tumors and heterogeneity in other xenografts. Both [89Zr]PEG-DFB4 and [89Zr]PEG-DFB1-TLZ3 showed similar accumulation and distribution in s.c. and metastatic tumor models. Both nanocarriers can measure tumor model passive uptake heterogeneity. Although heterogeneous, prostate cancer xenografts had low EPR. These starPEG nanocarriers could be used as PET imaging surrogates to predict drug delivery and efficacy. ©2024 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214320587,Biodistribution; Nanocarriers

In this study, three albumin-bound FAP inhibitor (FAPI) radioligands, 68Ga/177Lu-DOTA-ALB-01, 68Ga/177Lu-DOTA-ALB-02, and 68Ga/177Lu-DOTA-ALB-03, were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro stability, binding affinity, in vivo biodistribution, and tumor uptake using 68Ga and 177Lu labeling. All radioligands are stable in saline and plasma and exhibit high FAP-binding affinity. 177Lu-DOTA-ALB-02 has longer retention in circulation than 177Lu-FAPI-46 and other radioligands. Continuous tumor accumulation was observed during imaging with both 177Lu-DOTA-ALB-01 and 177Lu-DOTA-ALB-02. Notably, 177Lu-DOTA-ALB-02 had a significant tumor/nontarget ratio as indicated by biodistribution data. The outstanding tumor retention properties of 177Lu-DOTA-ALB-02 have been demonstrated in small-animal single-photon emission computed tomography imaging and biodistribution studies; therefore, it is considered the albumin-binding FAPI with the most favorable pharmacokinetic and imaging properties, worthy of further clinical investigation. ©2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012887207,Biodistribution; DOTA; Human serum albumin

Adipocytes are the main nonmalignant cells of the breast tumor microenvironment (TME). However, adipocyte metabolism is usually ignored in oncology, and the mechanisms that couple T2D to TNBC outcomes are poorly understood. In this study, we hypothesized that exosomes, small vesicles secreted by TME breast adipocytes, drive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in TNBC via miRNAs. Exosomes were purified from conditioned media of 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, either insulin-sensitive (IS) or insulin-resistant (IR). Murine 4T1 cells, a TNBC model, were treated with exosomes in vitro (72 hours). EMT, proliferation, and angiogenesis were elevated in IR versus control and IS.

We studied genome landscapes, phylogenies, and clonal compositions of 91 PDACs in relation to clinicopathologic features. There was no difference in the number of driver mutations or evolutionary timing when each mutation occurred. High truncal density, a metric of the accumulation of somatic mutations in the lineage that gave rise to each PDAC, was significantly associated with worse overall survival. Polyclonal, monoclonal, or mixed polyclonal/monoclonal metastases were identified across the cohort, highlighting multiple forms of intertumoral heterogeneity. Advanced stage and treated PDACs had higher odds of being polyclonal, whereas oligometastatic PDACs had fewer driver alterations, a lower fractional allelic loss, and increased likelihood of being monoclonal. In sum, our findings reveal novel insights into the dynamic nature of the PDAC genome beyond established genetic paradigms. Significance: Although the pancreatic cancer genome has been described, it has not been explored with respect to stages of diagnosis or treatment bottlenecks.

EZH2 is overexpressed in many cancers, and studies in mice attributed both prooncogenic and tumor suppressive functions to EZH2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). EZH2 deletion enhances de novo KRAS-driven neoplasia following pancreatic injury, while increased EZH2 expression in patients with PDAC is correlated to poor prognosis, suggesting a context-dependant effect for EZH2 in PDAC progression. In this study, we examined EZH2 in pre- and early neoplastic stages of PDAC. Using an inducible model to delete the SET domain of EZH2 in adult acinar cells (EZH2ΔSET), we showed that loss of EZH2 activity did not prevent acinar cell regeneration in the absence of oncogenic KRAS (KRASG12D) nor did it increase PanIN formation following KRASG12D activation in adult mice. Loss of EZH2 did reduce recruitment of inflammatory cells and, when combined with a more aggressive PDAC model, promoted widespread PDAC progression and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. This study suggests that expression of EZH2 in adult acinar cells restricts PDAC initiation and progression by affecting both the tumor microenvironment and acinar cell differentiation. © 2024, Jaune-Pons et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217648850,PRC2; Tumor progression

Understanding the molecular underpinnings of DKD is critical to designing tailored therapeutic approaches. Here, we focused on sex differences and the contribution of aging toward the progression of DKD. To explore these questions, we utilized young (12 weeks old) and aged (approximately 50 weeks old) type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN) rats. We revealed that the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/ stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway was upregulated in T2DN rats compared with nondiabetic Wistar rats and in type 2 diabetic human kidneys. The activation of the cGAS/STING signaling pathway exhibited distinct protein expression profiles between male and female T2DN rats, with these differences becoming more pronounced with aging. RNA-Seq analysis of the kidney cortex in both male and female T2DN rats, at both younger and older ages, revealed several key molecules, highlighting crucial genes within the cGAS/STING pathway. Thus, our study delved deep into understanding the intricate sexual differences in the development and progression of DKD and we propose the cGAS/STING pathway as an essential contributor to disease development. © 2024, Khedr et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214325933,Sexual dimorphism; Sting

The clinical development of GIP receptor–GLP-1 receptor (GIPR–GLP-1R) multiagonists exemplified by tirzepatide and emerging GIPR antagonist–GLP-1R agonist therapeutics such as maritide is increasing interest in the extrapancreatic actions of incretin therapies. Both GLP-1 and GIP modulate inflammation, with GLP-1 also acting locally to alleviate gut inflammation in part through antiinflammatory actions on GLP-1R+ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. In contrast, whether GIP modulates gut inflammation is not known. Here, using gain- and loss-of-function studies, we show that GIP alleviates 5-fluorouracil–induced (5FU-induced) gut inflammation, whereas genetic deletion of Gipr exacerbates the proinflammatory response to 5FU in the murine small bowel (SB). Bone marrow (BM) transplant studies demonstrated that BM-derived Giprexpressing cells suppress 5FU-induced gut inflammation in the context of global Gipr deficiency. Within the gut, Gipr was localized to nonimmune cells, specifically stromal CD146+ cells. Hence, the extrapancreatic actions of GIPR signaling extend to the attenuation of gut inflammation, findings with potential translational relevance for clinical strategies modulating GIPR action in people with type 2 diabetes or obesity. © 2024, Hammoud et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217712040,Gastric inhibitory polypeptide; Glucagon-like peptide-2; Incretin; Proinflammatory cytokine

Chemokines have been identified as major conductors of islet infiltration by autoaggressive leukocytes, including antigen-presenting cells and islet autoantigen–specific T cells. We have previously generated a road map of gene expression in the islet microenvironment during T1D in a mouse model and found that most of the chemokine axes are chronically upregulated during T1D. The XCL1/XCR1 chemokine axis is of particular interest, since XCR1 is exclusively expressed on conventional DCs type 1 (cDC1) that excel by their high capacity for T cell activation. Here, we demonstrate that cDC1-expressing XCR1 are present in and around the islets of patients with T1D and of individuals with islet autoantibody positivity. Furthermore, we show that XCL1 plays an important role in the attraction of highly potent DCs expressing XCR1 to the islets in an inducible mouse model for T1D.

In contrast, its effects on periarticular skeletal muscle are under-studied. Furthermore, while TNF inhibition is an effective therapy for RA synovitis, it exacerbates fibrosis in muscle injury models. We aimed to investigate whether myositis and muscle fibrosis are features of inflammatory arthritis and evaluate whether targeted RA therapies influence these disease features. Periarticular muscle was analyzed in murine models of poly- and monoarticular inflammatory arthritis: serum transfer–induced arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis, K/BxN, and antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). Periarticular myositis and an increase in muscle fibroadipocyte progenitors (FAPs) were observed in all models, despite diverse arthritogenic mechanisms. Periarticular muscle fibrosis was observed from day 15 in AIA. Neither etanercept nor baricitinib suppressed periarticular myositis or subsequent fibrosis compared to vehicle, despite reducing arthritis. Notably, etanercept failed to prevent muscle fibrosis even when initiated early, but this was not linked to increased FAP survival or collagen production. Corroborating these data, radiographic and histological analyses revealed periarticular myositis in patients with RA. We conclude that periarticular myositis and fibrosis are under-recognized features of inflammatory arthritis. Targeted RA therapies may not prevent periarticular muscle sequelae, despite controlling arthritis. © 2025, Day et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002250677,Inflammatory arthritis

We aimed to characterize factors associated with the under-studied complication of cognitive decline in aging people with long-duration type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS. Joslin “Medalists” (n = 222; T1D ≥ 50 years) underwent cognitive testing. Medalists (n = 52) and age-matched nondiabetic controls (n = 20) underwent neuro- and retinal imaging. Brain pathology (n = 26) was examined. Relationships among clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging parameters were evaluated. RESULTS. Compared with controls, Medalists had worse psychomotor function and recall, which associated with female sex, lower visual acuity, reduced physical activity, longer diabetes duration, and higher inflammatory cytokines. On neuroimaging, compared with controls, Medalists had significantly lower total and regional brain volumes, equivalent to 9 years of accelerated aging, but small vessel disease markers did not differ.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors slow down progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether the circulating substrate mix is related to CKD progression and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and albuminuric CKD in the CREDENCE trial. METHODS. We measured fasting substrates in 2,543 plasma samples at baseline and 1 year after randomization to either 100 mg canagliflozin or placebo and used multivariate Cox models to explore their association with CKD progression, heart failure hospitalization/cardiovascular death (hHF/CVD), and mortality. RESULTS. Higher baseline lactate and free fatty acids (FFAs) were independently associated with a lower risk of CKD progression (HR = 0.73 [95% CI: 0.54–0.98] and HR = 0.67 [95% CI: 0.48–0.95], respectively) and hHF/CVD HR = 0.70 [95% CI: 0.50–0.99] and HR = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.42–0.94]). Canagliflozin led to a rise in plasma FFAs, glycerol, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate. Changes in substrate between baseline and year 1 predicted an approximately 30% reduction in relative risk of both CKD progression and hHF/CVD independently of treatment. More patients who did not respond to canagliflozin treatment in terms of CKD progression belonged to the bottom lactate and FFA distribution tertiles. CONCLUSION. In T2D patients with albuminuric CKD, basic energy substrates selectively influenced major long-term endpoints; canagliflozin treatment amplified their effects by chronically raising their circulating levels. © 2024, Ferrannini et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212875187,Credence

Female mice were started on high-fat or regular diet 8 weeks before breeding and throughout pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, all offspring were fed a regular diet. By 12 weeks, body weight and fat were increased in offspring of high-fat diet–fed dams, which was accompanied by metabolic dysfunction and hyperinsulinemia. This was followed by increased epithelial sensory innervation and increased bronchoconstriction to inhaled 5-hydroxytryptamine at 16 weeks. Bronchoconstriction was nerve mediated and blocked by vagotomy or atropine. A high-fat diet before pregnancy exerted the most influence on offspring airway physiology. Maternal obesity induced metabolic dysfunction and hyperinsulinemia, resulting in hyperinnervation and subsequent increased reflex-mediated hyperresponsiveness in their offspring.

In search of a molecular regulator that could simultaneously and reciprocally control both LDL and HDL levels, we screened a microRNA (miR) library using human hepatoma Huh-7 cells. We identified miR-541-3p that both significantly decreases apoB and increases apoA1 expression by inducing mRNA degradation of 2 different transcription factors, Znf101 and Casz1. We found that Znf101 enhances apoB expression, while Casz1 represses apoA1 expression. The hepatic knockdown of Casz1 in mice increased plasma apoA1, HDL, and cholesterol efflux capacity. The hepatic knockdown of Zfp961, an ortholog of Znf101, reduced lipogenesis and production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and atherosclerosis, without causing hepatic lipid accumulation.

One approach is to study relevant endophenotypes, a strategy we applied to the UBE2E2 locus where noncoding single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are associated with both T2D and visceral adiposity (a pathologic endophenotype). We integrated CRISPR targeting of SNV-containing regions and unbiased CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening to establish candidate cis-regulatory regions, complemented by genetic loss of function in murine diet-induced obesity or ex vivo adipogenesis assays. Nomination of a single causal gene was complicated, however, because targeting of multiple genes near UBE2E2 attenuated adipogenesis in vitro; CRISPR excision of SNV-containing noncoding regions and a CRISPRi regulatory screen across the locus suggested concomitant regulation of UBE2E2, the more distant UBE2E1, and other neighborhood genes; and compound heterozygous loss of function of both Ube2e2 and Ube2e1 better replicated pathological adiposity and metabolic phenotypes compared with homozygous loss of either gene in isolation. This study advances a model whereby regulatory effects of noncoding variation not only extend beyond the nearest gene but may also drive complex diseases through polygenic regulatory effects. © 2024, Zhang et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216332530,Candidate gene; Genome-wide Association Study

Targeting ketohexokinase (KHK), the first enzyme of fructose metabolism, has been investigated for the management of metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We compared the effects of systemic, small molecule inhibitor of KHK enzymatic activity with hepatocyte-specific, N-acetylgalactosamine siRNA–mediated knockdown of KHK in mice on an HFD. We measured KHK enzymatic activity, extensively quantified glycogen accumulation, performed RNA-Seq analysis, and enumerated hepatic metabolites using mass spectrometry. Both KHK siRNA and KHK inhibitor led to an improvement in liver steatosis; however, via substantially different mechanisms, KHK knockdown decreased the de novo lipogenesis pathway, whereas the inhibitor increased the fatty acid oxidation pathway. Moreover, KHK knockdown completely prevented hepatic fructolysis and improved glucose tolerance. Conversely, the KHK inhibitor only partially reduced fructolysis, but it also targeted triokinase, mediating the third step of fructolysis. This led to the accumulation of fructose-1 phosphate, resulting in glycogen accumulation, hepatomegaly, and impaired glucose tolerance. Overexpression of wild-type, but not kinase-dead, KHK in cultured hepatocytes increased hepatocyte injury and glycogen accumulation after treatment with fructose. The differences between KHK inhibition and knockdown are, in part, explained by the kinase-dependent and -independent effects of KHK on hepatic metabolism. © 2024, Park et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211475528,Carbohydrate Metabolism

An improved understanding of wound-healing mechanisms is paramount. Collagen XVII (COL17), a pivotal constituent of hemidesmosomes, holds considerable promise for regulating epidermal cell adhesion to the basement membrane as well as for epidermal cell motility and self-renewal of epidermal stem cells. However, the precise role of COL17 in wound repair remains elusive, and the upstream regulatory mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we delineated the temporal and spatial expression patterns of COL17 at the epidermal wound edge. Subsequently, we investigated the indispensable role of COL17 in keratinocyte activation and reepithelialization during wound healing, demonstrating the restoration of the normal repair process by COL17 overexpression in diabetic wounds. Notably, we identified a key transcriptional signaling pathway for COL17, wherein pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2) promotes phosphorylation of STAT3, leading to its activation and subsequent induction of COL17 expression upon injury. Ultimately, by manipulating this pathway using the PKM2 nuclear translocator SAICAR, we revealed a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing the healing of chronic wounds. : © 2025, Liu et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219040153,Expression (computer science)

Our finding demonstrated that VLX-1005, a potent 12-LOX inhibitor, effectively delayed the onset of autoimmune diabetes in human gene replacement non-obese diabetic mice. By spatial proteomics analysis, VLX-1005 treatment resulted in marked reductions in infiltrating T and B cells and macrophages, with accompanying increases in immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1, suggesting a shift toward an immunosuppressive microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of isolated islets and polarized proinflammatory macrophages revealed significant alteration of cytokine-responsive pathways and a reduction in IFN response after VLX-1005 treatment. Our studies demonstrated that the ALOX12 human replacement gene mouse provides a platform for the preclinical evaluation of LOX inhibitors and supports VLX-1005 as an inhibitor of human 12-LOX that engages the enzymatic target and alters the inflammatory phenotypes of islets and macrophages to promote the delay of autoimmune diabetes. © 2024, Nargis et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212814551,Autoimmune diabetes

While fatty acids are the preferred energy source for RTECs via fatty acid oxidation (FAO), FAO-mediated H2O2 production in mitochondria has been shown to be a major source of oxidative stress. We have previously shown that a mitochondrial flavoprotein, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), which catalyzes a key step in mitochondrial FAO, directly produces H2O2 in vitro. Furthermore, we showed that renal LCAD becomes hyposuccinylated during AKI. Here, we demonstrated that succinylation of recombinant LCAD protein suppresses the production of H2O2. Following 2 distinct models of AKI, cisplatin treatment or renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), LCAD–/– mice demonstrated renoprotection. Specifically, LCAD–/– kidneys displayed mitigated renal tubular injury, decreased oxidative stress, preserved mitochondrial function, enhanced peroxisomal FAO, and decreased ferroptotic cell death. LCAD deficiency confers protection against 2 distinct models of AKI. This suggests a therapeutically attractive mechanism whereby preserved mitochondrial respiration as well as enhanced peroxisomal FAO by loss of LCAD mediates renoprotection against AKI. © 2025, Chiba et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000835305,Renal Injury

Preclinical experiments have used animal models to study this phenomenon, yet the response of human cerebral ECs to BBB disruption remains unclear. In our phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04528680), we used low-intensity pulsed ultrasound with microbubbles (LIPU/MB) to induce transient BBB disruption of peritumoral brain in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. We found radiographic evidence that BBB integrity was mostly restored within 1 hour of this procedure. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and transmission electron microscopy, we analyzed the acute response of human brain ECs to ultrasound-mediated BBB disruption. Our analysis revealed distinct EC gene expression changes after LIPU/MB, particularly in genes related to neurovascular barrier function and structure, including changes to genes involved in the basement membrane, EC cytoskeleton, and junction complexes, as well as caveolar transcytosis and various solute transporters. Ultrastructural analysis showed that LIPU/MB led to a decrease in luminal caveolae, the emergence of cytoplasmic vacuoles, and the disruption of the basement membrane and tight junctions, among other things. These findings suggested that acute BBB disruption by LIPU/MB led to specific transcriptional and ultrastructural changes and could represent a conserved mechanism of BBB repair after neurovascular injury in humans. © 2025, Gould et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219070051,Occludin; Transcytosis

Maladaptive hypertrophy, podocyte stress, and depletion contribute to kidney function decline. Although insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) plays a key role in early hypertrophic responses in the single kidney state, its impact on kidney transplant (KTx) outcomes remains uncertain. This report tests the hypothesis that early IGF-1 exposure reduces KTx survival. METHODS. Population datasets compared incident death-censored graft failure (DCGF) rates by age at KTx (n = 366,404) with IGF-1 levels by age (n = 15,014). A clinical study of 216 KTx recipients evaluated the association of IGF-1 exposure with DCGF and secondary outcomes of proteinuria and biopsy-proven acute rejection. IGF-1 exposure was modeled using pre-KTx IGF-1 levels and donor kidney dose estimated from the donor/recipient body surface area ratio reflecting allograft hyperfiltration. The association of DCGF with an IGF1 SNP linked to high IGF-1 levels was assessed in 724 genotyped allograft recipients. Single-cell transcriptomic data from first-year post-KTx patients and binephric donors were compared to assess intrarenal cellular expression of IGF1, IGF1R, and growth hormone receptor (GHR) transcripts. RESULTS. DCGF risk by age at KTx paralleled IGF-1 levels by age. Higher IGF-1 exposure was associated with significantly increased risks of DCGF, proteinuria, and T cell–mediated rejection. Genotypic analysis showed a 50% increase in DCGF risk per risk allele at IGF1 expression quantitative trait locus rs35767. First-year biopsy results revealed no increase in intrarenal IGF1 transcripts, while GHR and IGF1R transcripts were suppressed, consistent with circulating IGF-1 (vs. graft-derived IGF-1) being the primary source of IGF-1 exposure. CONCLUSION. We identify a role for the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis in reducing KTx survival. © 2025, Cusick et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007944190,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Adipose tissue plays a key role in obesity/metabolic syndrome by releasing adipokines that regulate systemic energy/ lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Adiponectin (ADPN), the most abundant adipokine, modulates energy/metabolism homeostasis through its insulin-sensitizing and antiinflammatory effects. Human plasma ADPN levels are inversely associated with obesity and diabetes. To the best of our knowledge, the role of adipokines such as ADPN in the LUTS associated with obesity/metabolic syndrome remains unknown. We have tested such a possible role in a global ADPN-knockout (Adpn–/–) mouse model. Adpn–/– mice exhibited increased voiding frequency, small voids, and reduced bladder smooth muscle (BSM) contractility, with absence of purinergic contraction. Molecular examination indicated significantly altered metabolic and purinergic pathways. The ADPN receptor agonist AdipoRon was found to abolish acute BSM contraction. Intriguingly, both AMPK activators and inhibitors also abolished BSM purinergic contraction. These data indicate the important contribution of what we believe is a novel ADPN signaling pathway to the regulation of BSM contractility. Dysregulation of this ADPN signaling pathway might be an important mechanism leading to LUTS associated with obesity/metabolic syndrome. © 2025, Luo et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218999595,Contractility; Electrical impedance myography

Although IVF is viewed as largely safe, it is associated with adverse outcomes in the fetus, placenta, and adult offspring. Because studies focusing on the effect of IVF on the male reproductive system are limited, we used a mouse model to assess the morphological and molecular effects of IVF on male offspring. We evaluated 3 developmental stages: 18.5-day fetuses and 12- and 39-week-old adults. Regardless of age, we observed changes in testicular-to-body weight ratios, serum testosterone levels, testicular morphology, gene expression, and DNA methylation. Also, sperm showed changes in morphology and DNA methylation. To assess multigenerational phenotypes, we mated IVF-conceived and naturally conceived males with wild-type females. Offspring from IVF males exhibited decreased fetal-to-placental weight ratios and changes in placenta gene expression and morphology regardless of sex. At 12 weeks of age, offspring showed higher body weights and differences in glucose, triglyceride, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL/VLDL-C levels. Both sexes showed changes in gene expression in liver, testes, and ovaries and decreased global DNA methylation.

While soy-based lipid emulsions (SLE) are commonly used in PN, they may contribute to cholestatic liver injury. In contrast, mixed lipid emulsions (MLE) show promise in preventing cholestasis in infants without BA, potentially by restoring bile flow. However, their effectiveness in patients of complete bile duct obstruction, as seen in BA, remains uncertain. To explore the potential benefits of MLE in BA, we utilized a neonatal pig model of bile duct ligation (BDL). Pigs underwent either BDL or sham surgery and were subsequently fed either MLE or SLE via PN, or enterally with formula. The MLE-BDL pigs exhibited significantly greater weight gain compared with those fed SLE or formula enterally. Additionally, MLE-BDL pigs showed higher serum bile acid and γ-glutamyl transferase concentrations compared with SLE-BDL pigs.

Liver progenitor cells (LPCs) contribute to tissue regeneration after severe hepatic injury, yet signals instructing progenitor cell dynamics and fate are largely unknown. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) and TIMP3 control the sheddases ADAM10 and ADAM17, key for NOTCH activation. Here we uncover the role of the TIMP/ADAM/NOTCH/DLK1 axis in LPC maintenance and cholangiocyte specification. Combined TIMP1/TIMP3 loss in vivo caused abnormal portal triad stoichiometry accompanied by collagen deposits, dysregulated Notch signaling, and increased soluble DLK1. The MIC1-1C3+CD133+CD26– biliary progenitor population was reduced following acute CCl4 or chronic DDC liver injury and in aged TIMP-deficient livers. Single-cell RNA sequencing data interrogation and RNAscope identified portal mesenchymal cells coexpressing ADAM17/DLK1 as enzymatically equipped to process DLK1 and direct LPC differentiation. Specifically, TIMP-deficient biliary fragment–derived organoids displayed increased propensity for cholangiocyte differentiation. ADAM17 inhibition reduced Sox9-mediated cholangiocyte differentiation, prolonging organoid growth and survival, whereas WT organoids treated with soluble DLK1 triggered Sox9 expression and cholangiocyte specification in mouse and patient-derived liver organoids. Thus, metalloproteinase inhibitors regulate instructive signals for biliary cell differentiation and LPC preservation within the portal niche, providing a new basis for cell therapy strategies.

Lipin 1 catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, the penultimate step of triglyceride synthesis, which is essential for lipid storage. Herein we found that adipose tissue LPIN1 expression is decreased in people with obesity compared with lean subjects, and low LPIN1 expression correlated with multi-tissue insulin resistance and increased rates of hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Comprehensive metabolic and multiomic phenotyping demonstrated that adipocyte-specific Lpin1-/- mice had a metabolically unhealthy phenotype, including liver and skeletal muscle insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, and transcriptomic signatures of metabolically associated steatohepatitis that was exacerbated by high-fat diets. We conclude that adipocyte lipin 1-mediated lipid storage is vital for preserving adipose tissue and systemic metabolic health, and its loss predisposes mice to metabolically associated steatohepatitis. © 2024, LaPoint et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211213598,Expression (computer science)

However, the role of immune cell–mediated inflammation remains elusive. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified a subset of CX3CR1+ macrophages mainly located in the intima in the aortic roots and ascending aortas of Fbn1C1041G/+ mice, further validated in MFS patients. Specific elimination of CX3CR1+ cells by diphtheria toxin in Cx3cr1-CreERT2iDTRF/+Fbn1C1041G/+ mice efficiently ameliorated TAA progression. Administering the monoclonal antibodies to respectively neutralize TNF-α and IGF1 produced by CX3CR1+ cells from MFS patients greatly suppressed the cocultured MFS patient–specific induced pluripotent stem cell–derived VSMC inflammation. BM transplantation and parabiosis revealed that CX3CR1+ macrophages are mainly originated from BM-derived monocytes. Targeting TNF-α and IGF1 in CX3CR1+ macrophages via shRNA lentivirus transduction in BM cells efficiently suppressed TAA development in BM-transplanted Fbn1C1041G/+ mice. Application of the CCR2 antagonist RS504393 to inhibit monocyte infiltration markedly reduced the accumulation of CX3CR1+ macrophages and subsequently alleviated TAA progression in Fbn1C1041G/+ mice. In summary, CX3CR1+ macrophages mainly located in aortic intima mediate TAA formation by paracrinally causing VSMC inflammation, and targeting them offers a potential antiinflammatory therapeutic strategy for MFS-related TAA. © 2024, Huang et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216214590,CX3CR1; Thoracic aortic aneurysm

Hydralazine exposure has been linked to autoimmune diseases, including antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) vasculitis. Our hypothesis posits that hydralazine covalently binds to myeloperoxidase (MPO), triggering the autoimmune response in ANCA vasculitis. In vitro, we observed formation of carbonyl derivatives on amine groups in the presence of acrolein. This facilitated the subsequent binding of hydralazine to heme-containing proteins, including MPO, via a Michael addition. Our studies demonstrated that carbonyl derivatives and hydrazone adducts induced conformational changes in the MPO heavy chain, potentially changing its immunogenicity. We identified hydrazone adducts on circulating MPO in patients with hydralazine-associated ANCA vasculitis. These patients exhibited elevated anti-MPO IgM levels, while anti-MPO IgG levels were comparable between hydralazine-associated and nonhydralazine-associated vasculitis patients. IgM isolated from patients with hydralazine-associated MPO ANCA demonstrated a heightened affinity to hydralazine-modified MPO and activated neutrophil-like HL-60 cells. Hydralazine-modified MPO was pathogenic, as demonstrated by splenocyte transfer in a mouse model of ANCA vasculitis. Our findings unveil a mechanism of drug-induced autoimmunity wherein stepwise chemical modifications of MPO lead to conformational changes and hydrazone adduct formation, producing a neoantigen that generates pathogenic autoantibodies. © 2025, Xi et al.

Although GIP is the dominant incretin in humans, the detailed molecular mechanisms governing its release remain to be explored. GIP secretion is regulated by the activity of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed by K cells. GPCRs couple to 1 or more specific classes of heterotrimeric G proteins. In the present study, we focused on the potential metabolic roles of K cell Gs. First, we generated a mouse model that allowed us to selectively stimulate K cell Gs signaling. Second, we generated a mouse strain harboring an inactivating mutation of Gnas, the gene encoding the α-subunit of Gs, selectively in K cells. Metabolic phenotyping studies showed that acute or chronic stimulation of K cell Gs signaling greatly improved impaired glucose homeostasis in obese mice and in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, due to enhanced GIP secretion. In contrast, K cell–specific Gnas-KO mice displayed markedly reduced plasma GIP levels. These data strongly suggest that strategies aimed at enhancing K cell Gs signaling may prove useful for the treatment of diabetes and related metabolic diseases. © 2024, Oteng et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212568336,Enteroendocrine cell; GNAS complex locus; Gastric inhibitory polypeptide; Incretin

This study examined the underlying cellular mechanisms associated with insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic disease risk within subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in youth with obesity and IR compared with those without IR. METHODS. Thirteen adolescents who were insulin sensitive (IS) and 17 adolescents with IR and obesity underwent a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test and MRI to measure abdominal fat distribution and liver fat content. Lipolysis was determined by glycerol turnover ([2H5]-glycerol infusion) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) phosphorylation (Western blot) from SAT samples biopsied prior to and 30-minutes following insulin infusion during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC). RESULTS. Glycerol turnover suppression during the HEC (first step) was lower in participants with IR compared with those with IS. Prior to insulin infusion, activated ATGL (reflected by the p-ATGL (Ser406)-to-ATGL ratio) was greater in participants with IR compared with those with IS and suppressed in response to a 30-minute insulin exposure in participants with IS, but not in those with IR. Lastly, greater ATGL inactivation is associated with greater glycerol suppression and lower liver fat. CONCLUSIONS. Insulin-mediated inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis via ATGL is dysregulated among adolescents with IR compared with those with IS, thereby serving as a vital mechanism linking glucose and insulin dysregulation and ectopic lipid storage within the liver. © 2025, Slusher et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000732966,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

While most hypertriglyceridemia is asymptomatic, hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis (HTGAP) can be more severe than AP of other etiologies. The reasons underlying this are unclear. We thus examined whether lipolytic generation of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) from circulating triglycerides (TGs) could worsen clinical outcomes. METHODS. Admission serum TGs, NEFA composition, and concentrations were analyzed prospectively for 269 patients with AP. These parameters, demographics, and clinical outcomes were compared between HTG-AP (TGs >500 mg/dL; American Heart Association [AHA] 2018 guidelines) and AP of other etiologies. Serum NEFAs were correlated with serum TG fatty acids (TGFAs) alone and with the product of TGFA serum lipase (NEFAs - TGFAs × lipase). Studies in mice and rats were conducted to understand the role of HTG lipolysis in organ failure and to interpret the NEFA-TGFA correlations. RESULTS. Patients with HTG-AP had higher serum NEFA and TG levels and more severe AP (19% vs. 7%; P < 0.03) than did individuals with AP of other etiologies. Correlations of long-chain unsaturated NEFAs with corresponding TGFAs increased with TG concentrations up to 500 mg/dL and declined thereafter. However, NEFA - TGFA × lipase correlations became stronger with TGs above 500 mg/dL. AP and intravenous lipase infusion in rodents caused lipolysis of circulating TGs to NEFAs. This led to multisystem organ failure, which was prevented by pancreatic TG lipase deletion or lipase inhibition. CONCLUSIONS. HTG-AP is made severe by the NEFAs generated from intravascular lipolysis of circulating TGs. Strategies that prevent TG lipolysis may be effective in improving clinical outcomes for patients with HTG-AP.

Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance often accompany elevated serum urate levels (hyperuricemia), a highly heritable condition that triggers gout; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. METHODS. We evaluated the association between the index of hyperinsulinemia and the fractional excretion of urate (FEUA) in 162 outpatients. The underlying mechanisms were investigated through single-cell data analysis and kinase screening combined with cell culture experiments. In 377,358 participants of the UK Biobank (UKBB), we analyzed serum urate, hyperinsulinemia, and salt intake. We also examined gene-environment interactions using single nucleotide variants in SLC22A12, which encodes urate transporter 1 (URAT1). RESULTS. The index of hyperinsulinemia was inversely associated with FEUA independently of other covariates. Mechanistically, URAT1 cell-surface abundance and urate transport activity were regulated by URAT1-Thr408 phosphorylation, which was stimulated by hyperinsulinemia via AKT. Kinase screening and single-cell data analysis revealed that serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), induced by high salt, activated the same pathway, increasing URAT1. Arg405 was essential for these kinases to phosphorylate URAT1-Thr408. In UKBB participants, hyperinsulinemia and high salt intake were independently associated with increased serum urate levels. We found that SLC22A12 expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) rs475688 synergistically enhanced the positive association between serum urate and hyperinsulinemia. CONCLUSION. URAT1 mediates the association between hyperinsulinemia and hyperuricemia.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, the intervention group received a 3-month NMPI program plus standard care, and the control group received standard care alone in a tertiary health care setting. Ninety-eight participants (baseline A1C > 7%) were randomized 1:1 to either NMPI or standard care group. The primary study outcomes were changes in A1C testing and self-management assessed using the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities tool at baseline and end of the study. Results: The intervention group had statistically significant improvement in their mean A1C level from baseline to the end of the study. In comparison, the control group also had improvement in their mean A1C level but was not statistically significant. Consistently, the intervention participants had better statistically significant improvements in self-management behaviors than the control group. There was a medium, negative correlation between A1C changes and overall self-care changes for the intervention group, whereas that of the control group was smaller.

Methods: A qualitative study with individual semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 adults (8 women, ages 45-74 years) with type 2 diabetes. Purposive sampling was used, and participants from 3 different intervention groups in the micro-choice-based concentrated group intervention were recruited. Thematic analysis was used for the data analysis. Results: Three main themes were identified: (1) group intervention tailored to individual needs through friendly and skilled professionals, (2) valuable social interactions and an experience of fellowship, and (3) commitment to change through goal setting and conscious micro-choices. The participants described a readiness for change that was met by important knowledge from skilled professionals in the concentrated intervention. They reported that new knowledge, particularly about micro-choices and the focus on how insulin works in the body, led to change in their awareness and self-management. The concentrated group intervention was a preferred setting that contained a sense of community without compromising on meeting individual needs. Participants described internalized changes after the intervention and a willingness to adhere to changes necessary for their self-management. Conclusion: Study findings showed that a micro-choice-based concentrated group intervention for people with type 2 diabetes can be a valuable approach contributing to improved patient activation and diabetes self-management.

This finding is intriguing because CHO cells do not generate α2-6 sialylation, which constitutes the majority of human pdVWF sialylation. We hypothesized that glycan differences might regulate the longer half-life of CHO-rVWF. In lectin plate-binding assays and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis, we confirmed that CHO-rVWF lacked α2-6–linked sialylation. Conversely, however, α2-3–linked sialylation was significantly increased on CHO-rVWF, which also had reduced exposed β-galactose (β-Gal) compared to pdVWF. Consistent with human data, CHO-rVWF clearance was significantly (P < .001) reduced in VWF–/– mice compared to pdVWF. However, clearance of asialo-pdVWF and asialo–CHO-rVWF were identical. In keeping with the in vivo half-life prolongation, CHO-rVWF binding to murine macrophages (P = .012) and HepG2 cells (P = .001) was significantly decreased compared to pdVWF. Furthermore, CHO-rVWF binding to purified macrophage-galactose-type lectin (MGL) receptor and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) was also significantly reduced. In contrast to pdVWF, in vivo studies in MGL1–/– mice and Asgr1–/– mice demonstrated that neither MGL nor ASGPR plays significant roles in regulating CHO-rVWF clearance. Together, our findings demonstrate that enhanced α2-3–linked sialylation on CHO-rVWF is responsible for its extended half-life. © 2025 American Society of Hematology",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002662423,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Many cytokines signal through the conserved Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in which tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs (pSTATs) function as transcription factors. STAT5 is a pivotal downstream mediator of several cytokines known to regulate hematopoiesis, but its function in the HSC compartment remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that STAT5-deficient HSCs exhibit an unusual phenotype, including reduced multilineage repopulation and self-renewal, combined with reduced exit from quiescence and increased differentiation. This was driven not only by the loss of canonical pSTAT5 signaling, but also by the loss of distinct transcriptional functions mediated by STAT5 that lack canonical tyrosine phosphorylation (uSTAT5). Consistent with this concept, expression of an unphosphorylatable STAT5 mutant constrained wild-type HSC differentiation, promoted their maintenance, and upregulated transcriptional programs associated with quiescence and stemness. The JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, which increased the uSTAT5:pSTAT5 ratio, had similar effects on murine HSC function; it constrained HSC differentiation and proliferation, promoted HSC maintenance, and upregulated transcriptional programs associated with stemness. Ruxolitinib also enhanced serial replating of normal human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), calreticulin-mutant murine HSCs, and HSPCs obtained from patients with myelofibrosis. Our results therefore reveal a previously unrecognized interplay between pSTAT5 and uSTAT5 in the control of HSC function and highlight JAK inhibition as a potential strategy for enhancing HSC function during ex vivo culture. Increased levels of uSTAT5 may also contribute to the failure of JAK inhibitors to eradicate myeloproliferative neoplasms. © 2025 by The American Society of Hematology.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216474433,Janus kinase 2; Lymphopoiesis; Ruxolitinib; STAT5

Although FN risk models exist, they have largely been developed and validated for solid tumors. We therefore examined whether baseline characteristics could predict which patients with AML and FN have a lower risk of progression to severe illness. We identified adults with high-grade myeloid neoplasms (≥10% blasts in the blood/marrow) who received intensive chemotherapy and who were admitted for FN between 2016 and 2023. We collected baseline clinical and disease variables. Outcomes were: infections identified, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and survival. A lower-risk (LR) outcome was defined as LOS <72 hours without ICU admission or inpatient death. Univariate and multivariable (MV) logistic regression models were used to assess covariate associations with outcomes. We identified 397 FN admissions in 248 patients (median age, 61; [range, 29-77] years). The median hospital LOS was 6 days (range, 1-56) days; 10% required ICU admission, and 3.5% died inpatient. Only 15% of admissions were LR. Infection was identified in 59% of admissions. Physiologic parameters, including heart rate, blood pressure, and fever height, were the best predictors of LR admission and infection. We developed MV models to predict LR admission and infection with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82 and 0.72, respectively. Established FN and critical illness models were not predictive of outcomes in AML, and we could not identify a LR group; thus, an AML-specific FN risk model requires further development and validation. © 2024 by The American Society of Hematology.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213248560,Univariate analysis

We observed that patients with >5% decrease in their body mass index in the 3 months preceding CAR T-cell treatment (weight loss group; all meeting one of the commonly accepted definitions of cancer cachexia) had higher disease burden and inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α) at the time of lymphodepletion and CAR T-cell infusion. Patients with weight loss experienced higher rates of grade 3+ neurotoxicity and early hematotoxicity, but those effects were not seen upon multivariable adjustment. However, in both univariate and multivariable analysis, patients with weight loss had worse response rates, overall survival, and event-free survival, indicating that weight loss is an independent poor prognostic factor. Our data suggest that weight loss in the 3 months preceding CAR T-cell therapy represents a worrisome “alarm signal” and a potentially modifiable factor, alongside tumor burden and inflammation, and warrants further investigation in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. © 2024 by The American Society of Hematology.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215275184,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Biswas I.; Panicker S.R.; Lupu F.; Rezaie A.R.,Physiological significance of antithrombin D-helix interaction with vascular GAGs,2025,Blood Advances,10.1182/bloodadvances.2024014756,"Antithrombin (AT) is an anticoagulant serpin involved in the regulation of proteolytic activities of coagulation proteases. AT also possesses a direct anti-inflammatory function. The anticoagulant function of AT is mediated through its reactive center loop–dependent inhibition of coagulation proteases, but anti-inflammatory function of AT is mediated via its D-helix–dependent interaction with vascular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). In vitro assays have established that therapeutic heparins promote the anticoagulant function of AT by binding D-helix and activating the serpin, however, the contribution of vascular GAGs to D-helix–dependent anticoagulant function of AT has remained poorly understood in vivo. Here, we explored this question by using 2 AT mutants, (AT-4Mut), which exhibits neither affinity for heparin nor D-helix–dependent anti-inflammatory signaling but possesses normal protease-inhibitory function and an inactive signaling-selective AT mutant in which its P1-Arg425 is deleted (AT-R425del). In vivo properties of mutants were compared with wild-type AT (AT-WT) in a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated AT-deficient mouse model. The siRNA knockdown efficiently reduced expression of AT and induced robust procoagulant and proinflammatory phenotypes in mice. Infusion of both AT-WT and AT-4Mut rescued the procoagulant phenotype of AT-deficient mice as evidenced by restoration of the plasma clotting time and inhibition of fibrin deposition. AT-WT also attenuated inflammation as evidenced by reduced VCAM-1 expression and leukocyte infiltration in the liver and lungs; however, AT-4Mut failed to attenuate inflammation. Interestingly, AT-R425del also effectively attenuated inflammation in AT-depleted mice. These results suggest that interaction of AT D-helix with vascular GAGs may primarily be responsible for anti-inflammatory signaling rather than protease-inhibitory function of the serpin. © 2025 American Society of Hematology.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000184596,Antithrombins; Serpin
Doi Y.; Hamano T.; Yamaguchi O.; Isaka Y.,Canagliflozin may increase thromboembolic events in males with erythrocytosis but not in females,2025,Blood Advances,10.1182/bloodadvances.2025016320,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are increasingly recognized as a common cause of drug-induced erythrocytosis. SGLT2 inhibitor–induced erythropoiesis may increase blood viscosity and precipitate thromboembolism, particularly in patients with preexisting erythrocytosis. We conducted a post hoc pooled analysis of patient-level data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study program and the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation trial, which assessed the safety and efficacy of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome, a composite of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and any thromboembolism, was evaluated using sex-specific Cox models, with baseline hematocrit as an effect modifier. Among participants with available baseline hematocrit values (98.5% [14 321/14 543]), 35% were female. Canagliflozin significantly increased hematocrit levels compared with placebo even in patients with erythrocytosis (males > 49%; females > 48%) and increased the proportion of individuals with erythrocytosis at 1 year (males, 16.9% vs 5.5%; females, 5.2% vs 1.0%). Overall, canagliflozin did not alter the risk of the primary outcome in either males or females. However, in males, baseline hematocrit levels modified the treatment effect on the primary outcome, whether assessed categorically (anemia, normal, and erythrocytosis) or continuously with fractional polynomial (FP) analysis (P interaction < .05). FP analysis showed treatment benefits in anemic males but show harm in those with erythrocytosis, primarily driven by an increased risk of MI. Meanwhile, no heterogeneity was seen in females for these outcomes. In conclusion, canagliflozin may pose a safety concern for thromboembolism in males with erythrocytosis at baseline, warranting further investigations. © 2025 American Society of Hematology.

Our objective was to investigate the efficacy of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) as a prophylactic treatment to prevent acute cellular rejection (ACR), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections and reduce the risk of CLAD. Methods This was a single-centre prospective randomised controlled trial conducted at the Medical University of Vienna (Vienna, Austria) between 2018 and 2020. It included 31 COPD recipients per group. The treatment group underwent ECP in addition to a standard triple-drug immunosuppression protocol after lung transplantation. The control group received standard triple-drug immunosuppressive therapy. The primary outcome was a composite outcome defined as incidence of high-grade ACR, CMV infection or CLAD within 24 months after lung transplantation. Results In the control group, 19 patients (61.3%) achieved the primary combined end-point compared with only six patients (19.4%) in the treatment group (p<0.001). Freedom from high-grade ACR was significantly greater in the ECP group (p=0.045). Cumulative A scores were significantly lower in the ECP group than in the control group at 3 months (0.18±0.44 versus 0.56±0.94; p<0.05) and at 12 months (0.25±0.48 versus 1.0±1.45; p=0.002). The rate of infections was lower in the ECP group with five cases and 67 cumulative hospital days compared with 22 cases and 309 days in the control group (p=0.002). Freedom from CLAD at 3 years was significantly greater in the ECP group (p=0.015). Conclusion Adding ECP to standard triple immunosuppression resulted in a significant reduction of the number of ACR episodes and significantly lower incidence of CLAD.

We aimed to identify long-term trajectories of disease progression in patients initiating biologics and investigate trajectory associations with disease burden and impact on biologic therapy efficacy. Methods Patients in the Danish Severe Asthma Register initiating biologic therapy between 2016 and 2022 were included and followed retrospectively in prescription databases starting 1995. We performed sequence analysis for inhaled corticosteroid treatment intensity over time combined with unsupervised trajectory clustering. Results In total, 755 patients were included and three pre-biologic disease trajectories were identified: “Chronic severe asthma” (26%), “Gradual onset severe asthma” (35%) and “Recent, sudden onset severe asthma” (39%). “Chronic severe asthma” patients were older, had the longest disease duration (35 years), the most impaired pulmonary function, the highest comorbidity prevalence and the lowest employment rate. “Recent, sudden onset severe asthma” patients were younger, had shorter disease duration (5 years), more tobacco exposure and the least impaired lung function. “Gradual onset severe asthma” patients had an intermediate burden of disease. The “Chronic severe asthma” cluster demonstrated the lowest prevalence of remission (17%) compared to the “Gradual onset severe asthma” (29%) and “Recent, sudden onset severe asthma” (32%) clusters. Conclusions Three pre-biologic disease trajectories were identified, with increased disease duration and activity associating with asthma and comorbidity burden. Early intervention may be key to prevent irreversible adverse outcomes for patients with severe asthma.

Methods This 52-week randomised clinical trial was conducted in outpatient settings at two general hospitals and two clinics in Japan from January 2013 to October 2018. 45 patients were randomly assigned to the usual care group (UG) or the acupuncture treatment group (AG). Participants were patients with COPD classified as stage II or higher according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease classification. The UG received usual care in accordance with the guidelines, and the AG received acupuncture treatment once a week for 48 times in addition to usual care. Changes in outcome measures were compared using analysis of covariance, with the total domain score from the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) measured at baseline and in week 52 as the primary outcome measure. Result The 45 participants comprised 21 patients in the UG and 24 patients in the AG. In week 52, the SGRQ total domain score was significantly improved in the AG compared with the UG (mean±SD difference from baseline, −22.8±19.0 in the AG versus 6.8±13.5 in the UG; regression coefficient between groups: −26.9, 95% CI −35.8 to −17.9). No severe adverse events were reported. Conclusion This study clearly suggested the long-term effectiveness of acupuncture.

The obstructive apnoea–hypopnoea index (oAHI) used for diagnosing and grading OSA has limitations in predicting CVD. The present study assessed and compared the association between nocturnal hypoxaemia parameters and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 187 consecutive adult outpatients diagnosed with OSA after home cardiorespiratory polygraphy. Blood pressure control was tested with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A standard transthoracic cardiac ultrasound examination assessed LVH. Oximetry parameters were grouped into a single parameter (Oxy-score) using factor analysis (a higher Oxy-score indicating better nocturnal oxygenation), which was tested for association with LVH. Results The mean age was 60±12 years, with 75% male sex and 94% overweight/obese. The prevalence of arterial hypertension and LVH was 92% and 75%, respectively. The prevalence of severe OSA was 44%, with a mean oAHI of 32±19. Patients with LVH had significantly higher oAHI (34±19 versus 27±18; p=0.030), oxygen desaturation index (41±23 versus 30±18; p=0.004), and worse oximetry parameters. Oxy-score results were independently associated with LVH (adjusted OR 0.45; p=0.044). oAHI lost its independent relationship with LVH when the model included the Oxy-score. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that oAHI was less accurate in predicting LVH than Oxy-score (area under the curve (AUC) 0.63, 95% CI 0.59–0.68 versus AUC 0.70, 95% CI 0.65–0.74, respectively; p=0.005). Conclusion Nocturnal oximetry parameters, grouped into a single parameter as a proxy of the global hypoxic burden, proved to be a better and independent predictor of LVH than oAHI, supporting the pivotal relevance of oximetry parameters beyond oAHI in patients with OSA. © The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008293013,Sleep

We aimed to investigate the association of these novel antihyperglycaemic drugs versus metformin with fewer COPD exacerbations in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) comorbid with COPD. Methods Using the national administrative database covering 99% of the medical facilities in Japan, we constructed three active comparators new-user cohorts comprising 36 317 patients with T2DM and COPD who initiated treatment with the novel antihyperglycaemic drugs and metformin between 2014 and 2022. Patients’ backgrounds were balanced using overlap propensity score weighting. We calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the initial occurrence of COPD exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model. Results DPP-4 Is were associated with a higher incidence of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (22.4 versus 20.4 per 100 person-years; HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07–1.25) compared with metformin. In contrast, the incidence of such exacerbations in the GLP-1 RAs (30.1 versus 24.4 per 100 person-years; HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87–1.32) and SGLT-2 Is (20.7 versus 21.8 per 100 person-years; HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94–1.06) groups were comparable with that in the metformin group. Conclusions While DPP-4 Is were associated with poorer control of COPD compared with metformin, GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 Is offered COPD control comparable with that of metformin. © The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007362097,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Emerging evidence suggests that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues may reduce the risk of exacerbation in patients with COPD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study investigates the impact of GLP-1 analogues on pulmonary outcomes in patients with COPD on single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT) and T2DM. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database and analysed adult patients with COPD and T2DM who received SITT between April 2005 and July 2023. Patients were categorised into GLP-1 analogue and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) cohorts. The primary efficacy outcome was COPD exacerbation, and the secondary efficacy outcomes were pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, intubation, oxygen dependence and all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were serious gastrointestinal adverse events. Results We included 6898 patients, with 4184 receiving GLP-1 analogues and 2714 receiving DPP4i. After matching, 1751 GLP-1 analogue users were matched with 1751 DPP4i users. GLP-1 analogue users had an 18% lower risk of COPD exacerbation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82 (95% CI 0.71–0.94)), a 28% reduced risk of pneumonia (HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.61–0.85)), a 34% reduced risk of oxygen dependence (HR 0.66 (95% CI 0.47–0.91)) and a 40% decreased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.60 (95% CI 0.47–0.77)). No significant serious gastrointestinal adverse events were observed. Conclusion GLP-1 analogues may be associated with reduced COPD exacerbations, pulmonary comorbidities and mortality in patients with COPD receiving SITT and T2DM, with no significant serious gastrointestinal safety concerns. © The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003664775,Dry-powder inhaler; Incretin; Rescue therapy

Methods Patients with bronchiectasis at 16 hospitals in Taiwan were recruited with a 1-year follow-up. The patients were classified into six groups: Group 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Group 2, Klebsiella pneumoniae; Group 3, other bacteria; Group 4, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM); Group 5, daily sputum without bacterial or NTM colonisation; and Group 6, dry bronchiectasis. Results In total, 1416 patients (mean age 67 years; 43% males) were included. The mean modified Reiff score was 5 (range 1–18). 59% (829 patients) had sputum, whereas the remaining did not. The proportions of bacteria and NTM cultured from sputum within 1 year of observation were 27% (381/1416) and 15% (202/1416), respectively. The most common bacterial isolate was P. aeruginosa (13%), followed by K. pneumoniae (7%). 26% of the patients experienced severe exacerbations at least once within the year. The 1-year all-cause mortality rate was 3%. Patients with sputum exhibited a higher rate of severe exacerbations compared to patients with dry bronchiectasis, regardless of the presence of bacteria or NTM ( p<0.001). Patients with bacterial colonisation had a higher mortality rate ( p<0.001). Further, the highest mortality rate was observed among those with K. pneumoniae colonisation (hazard ratio (HR) 8.39 (95% CI 2.39–29.49)), followed by individuals colonised with other bacteria (HR 8.04 (95% CI 2.36–27.38)) and P. aeruginosa (HR 7.83 (95% CI 2.45–25.03)). Additionally, old age was an independent risk factor (HR 2.72 (95% CI 1.19–6.18)). Conclusion K. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated from patients with bronchiectasis in Taiwan compared to Western countries and was associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes. © The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011389352,Clinical Significance

The CD131 receptor is indispensable for signalling by the β common (βc) family of cytokines encompassing granulocyte−macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-3, which instigate both type-2 and non-type-2 inflammatory responses. This study aims to determine whether antagonising CD131 signalling can prevent pulmonary inflammation, alveolar cell death and emphysema development. Methods We performed in-house and in silico transcriptomic analysis to investigate the gene expression of CD131 (CSF2RB) and pathway enrichment for βc cytokine signalling in blood, sputum and lung biopsies of COPD patients. To model emphysema, transgenic mice expressing human CD131 were exposed to elastase or cigarette smoke (CS) and a fully human monoclonal antibody (CSL311) was employed to inhibit CD131 signalling. Results CD131 gene expression was significantly increased in COPD, along with an enrichment of gene set for βc cytokine signalling. In transgenic mice subjected to emphysema models, CD131 antagonism effectively prevented lung injury, alveolar cell death and emphysema development. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing identified pathway enrichment for myeloid cell activation, type-2 immune response and macrophage alternative activation in elastase-induced emphysematous mice, mirroring human COPD. Blocking CD131 signalling almost completely reversed the global gene expression alterations associated with emphysema development. Conclusions CD131 signalling orchestrates pulmonary inflammation in COPD, resulting in immunopathology that underpins emphysema and lung function decline. Antagonising CD131 therefore represents a unique strategy to simultaneously target multiple pathogenic myeloid cell populations. © The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009237968,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Measuring N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels is diagnostically useful, but the optimal cut-off point must be determined. This study aimed to optimise NT-proBNP cut-offs for diagnosing HF-related PEs and develop a scoring model to improve diagnostic precision. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 2005 patients with PEs, who were divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified the optimal cut-off point for NT-proBNP in pleural fluid and serum. A scoring system was developed based on logistic regression (TRIPOD statement) that included both clinical and laboratory variables. Its diagnostic accuracy was compared with that of existing methods using the area under the curve (AUC). Results NT-proBNP ⩾2500 pg·mL−1 was found to be the optimal cut-off for identifying HF-related effusions. Pleural fluid NT-proBNP levels tended to have superior diagnostic accuracy compared with serum NT-proBNP levels. A scoring system, denominated as BANCA (bilateral effusions on chest radiographs, age, NT-proBNP levels in pleural fluid, cholesterol in pleural fluid, and albumin gradient), demonstrated an AUC of 0.957, outperforming existing diagnostic criteria for identifying cardiac effusions. In cases misclassified as exudates by Light’s criteria, the BANCA score accurately identified 80% of the HF-related PEs. Conclusions The BANCA score is a reliable tool for diagnosing HF-related PEs, offering superior accuracy compared with conventional methods. It is particularly useful for identifying cardiac effusions that are misclassified using traditional criteria. ©The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011862779,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Symptoms include recurrent and chronic airway infections which can lead to deteriorating lung function and inflammatory destructive lung disease in the form of persistent atelectasis and bronchiectasis. Routine blood testing may be used as a tool for disease monitoring and management. However, currently there are no consensus-based guidelines within the field of PCD. BEAT-PCD together with the ERN-LUNG PCD-Clinical Trial Network aimed to develop an international expert consensus statement on which routine blood tests should be conducted in patients with PCD. Methods An international panel of 33 PCD experts from 17 countries was established to generate consensus on routine blood testing in PCD. A modified Delphi technique with three e-survey rounds was used to reach consensus, which was defined as ⩾80% agreement for each statement. Two patient representatives were included in the consensus process. Results The expert panel reached consensus on 51 out of 101 statements (50%) on routine blood testing in children and adults with PCD to be performed at diagnosis, annually and on exacerbation. The statements include biomarkers for inflammation, haemoglobin, iron status, vitamin D, immune function, inhalant allergies, liver and kidney function, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Conclusions This is the first international consensus on routine blood testing in PCD. It highlights blood tests that may be relevant to perform at diagnosis, annually and on exacerbation in people with PCD. Further research on the clinical usefulness of routine blood testing in PCD is needed. ©The authors 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009080106,Consensus conference; Statement (logic)

Although the clinical symptoms of T1DM differ from those of MS, such as pancreatic β-cell failure in T1DM and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) in MS, both pathologies are considered as autoimmune-related diseases with shared pathogenic pathways, which include autophagy, inflammation and degeneration, among others. Considering the challenges in obtaining pancreatic β-cells and CNS tissue from patients with T1DM and MS, respectively, it is fundamental to explore alternative methods for evaluating disease status. Proteomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is an ideal approach for identifying novel and potential biomarkers for both autoimmune diseases. Methods: We conducted a proteomic analysis of PBMCs from patients with T1DM and relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis (herein forth MS) patients (n = 9 per condition), using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach. The patients were diagnosed following the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for T1DM and McDonald criteria for MS respectively, and were aged over 18 years and more than 2 years from the onset respectively. Results: A total of 2476 proteins were differentially expressed in PBMCs from patients with T1DM and MS patients compared with those form healthy controls (H). Predictive analysis highlighted 15 common proteins, up- or downregulated in PBMCs from patients with T1DM and MS patients vs. healthy controls, involved in the immune system activity (BTF3, TTR, CD59, CSTB), diseases of the neuronal system (TTR), signal transduction (STMN1, LAMTOR5), metabolism of nucleotides (RPS21), proteins (TTR, ENAM, CD59, RPS21, SRP9) and RNA (SRSF10, RPS21). In addition, this study revealed both shared and distinct molecular patterns between the two conditions. Conclusions: Compared with H, patients with T1DM and MS presented a specific expression pattern of common proteins has been identified. This pattern underscores the shared mechanisms involved in their immune responses and neurological complications, alongside dysregulation of the autophagy pathway. Notably, CSTB has emerged as a differential biomarker, distinguishing between these two autoimmune diseases. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217661590,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Recent single-molecule experiments on IsdB interaction with cell adhesion factors revealed an increase of the complex lifetime upon applying a stronger force (catch bond); this was suggested to favor host invasion under shear stress. An increased bond strength under mechanical stress was also detected by Atomic Force Spectroscopy (AFS) for the interaction between IsdB and Hb. Structural information on the underlying molecular mechanisms at the basis of this behaviour in IsdB-based complexes is missing. Here, we show that the single point mutation of Pro173 in the IsdB domain responsible for Hb binding, which weakens the IsdB:Hb interaction without hampering heme extraction, totally abolishes the previously observed behavior. Remarkably, Pro173 does not directly interact with Hb, but undergoes cis–trans isomerization upon IsdB:Hb complex formation, coupled to folding-upon binding of the corresponding protein loop. Our results suggest that these events might represent the molecular basis for the stress-dependence of bond strength observed for wild type IsdB, shedding light on the mechanisms that govern the capability of SA to infect host cells. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218219443,Force Spectroscopy

Case presentation: We present an unusual case of Ogilvie’s Syndrome in a 67-year-old female patient following elective dynamic hip screw surgery. She presented with gradual abdominal distention, as well as gas and stool retention. On the ninth postoperative day, abdominal examination revealed significant distention, marked tympanitic sounds upon percussion, diffuse tenderness on palpation, diminished bowel sounds, and moderate abdominal pain. Investigation tools demonstrated gross dilated in colons, up to 92.4 mm at the cecum level by Abdominal CT which, confirming the diagnosis of Ogilvie’s Syndrome. The team opted for conservative treatment, including nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion, fasting, and intravenous fluids. Subsequent imaging a few days later indicated a reduction in colonic diameter (cecum measuring 38 mm) and an improvement in the patient’s overall condition. Conclusion: Although Ogilvie’s Syndrome is infrequently encountered, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for gas and stool retention following surgical procedures. It is essential to be familiar with diagnostic methods and management protocols for this condition. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000342474,Angiology

This case series aims to shed light on TINU syndrome’s clinical features, underlying causes, and management strategies. The prevalence of TINU syndrome is relatively low with estimates of 3.5 cases/ million people with an incidence of 0.2 cases/ million/ year and it often goes underdiagnosed. The ratio of males to females reported was 4:1. Histological confirmation through renal biopsy is crucial, while systemic conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and Sjogren’s disease should be excluded. In most cases, TINU appears to be an idiopathic immune-mediated process, but it may be precipitated by drugs or infections. Antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been associated with some cases of TINU syndrome. Genetic markers, particularly HLA subtypes, have shown a strong association with TINU syndrome. Uveitis which is characterised by intraocular inflammation is a common feature of TINU syndrome. Anterior uveitis, the most prevalent form, presents with symptoms such as red eye, eye pain, photophobia, and keratic precipitates which are subdivided into granulomatous and non-granulomatous. Corticosteroids represent the primary treatment for ocular inflammation, while immunosuppressant medications may be employed for treatment of nephritis. Observations: Through the analysis of five TINU syndrome cases, this case series provides insights into the clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and biopsy results of patients with TINU syndrome. The cases include individuals with associated systemic conditions such as asthma, psoriasis and hyperthyroidism. Conclusion and importance: In conclusion, TINU syndrome is a rare condition characterised by the simultaneous occurrence of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis. Increased awareness among healthcare professionals is necessary for early recognition and appropriate management of this syndrome. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis, optimise diagnostic criteria, and explore more targeted therapeutic approaches for TINU syndrome. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011070415,Photophobia

However, the connection between it and angina pectoris has not yet been fully examined. This research sought to thoroughly investigate the possible link between the CALLY index and angina pectoris. Methods: This research utilized a cross-sectional approach, drawing data from the 2003–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which included 16,291 adults from the U.S. The CALLY index was calculated based on lymphocyte counts, serum albumin concentrations, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The relationship between the CALLY index and angina pectoris was analyzed using multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) methods. Subgroup and interaction analyses were also performed. Results: Elevated ln CALLY was inversely correlated with the prevalence of angina (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.95). Those in the highest quartile of the ln CALLY (Q4) were 38% less likely to experience angina than those in the lowest quartile (Q1) (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.84). RCS analysis revealed an L-shaped curve linking the CALLY index to angina, with a cutoff at 14. The consistency of this relationship was substantiated through subgroup analyses across different population groups. Conclusions: This research highlights a notable inverse relationship between the CALLY index and angina in U.S. adults, suggesting its potential as an innovative tool for evaluating angina. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218447779,Angiology; Vascular surgery

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of procalcitonin (PCT) for identifying pneumonia after CPB-assisted cardiac surgery. Methods: Patients diagnosed with POP were enrolled in the retrospective matched case-control study and were admitted to a Grade III general hospital in Nanjing in 2023. POP diagnosis was determined based on a combination of clinical and microbiological criteria.PCT and white blood cell count (WBC) data were systematically collected from day 1 (T1) to day 5 (T5). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and subject operating characteristics were utilized to evaluate the diagnostic performance of biomarkers. At the same time, a binary logistic regression model was developed to identify factors that influence the diagnosis of POP. Results: The study included 220 age- and sex-matched patients, comprising 56 individuals with POP and 164 uninfected patients constituting the non-POP group. ROC curve analysis revealed that serum PCT concentration exhibited an AUC > 0.7 from day 2 to day 5, whereas other indices demonstrated AUCs < 0.7 at these time points. Univariate and multivariate analyses highlighted serum PCT concentration on day 2, WBC count on day 5, the PCTT4-T1 variation rate, and days of mechanical ventilation as significant predictive factors for POP diagnosis, each demonstrating statistical significance (P < 0.05). The calculated AUC was 0.837 (95%CI: 0.773–0.902). The absolute PCT value exhibited superior diagnostic performance relative to its variance rate and WBC count, yielding optimal diagnostic accuracy with a cutoff value of 3.45 ng/ml. Conclusion: Serum PCT absolute value demonstrates higher sensitivity and specificity than other indices, offering superior diagnostic potential for predicting POP. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003865127,Angiology; Procalcitonin; Univariate analysis; White blood cell

Nephrolithiasis is a frequent complication of ADPKD, with a prevalence significantly higher than in the general population. However, its role in disease progression remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of asymptomatic nephrolithiasis on kidney function decline in ADPKD patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 195 ADPKD patients was followed at our nephrology clinic. Of these, 85 patients had nephrolithiasis (N+), and 110 did not (N-). Data on demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters, and kidney function were collected. ΔeGFR (change in eGFR over time) served as the primary outcome. Statistical analyses, including correlation and multiple linear regression, were performed to assess the predictors of ΔeGFR. Results: The N + group exhibited a significantly greater decline in kidney function compared to the N- group (ΔeGFR: 16.53 vs. 12.82 mL/min/1.73 m², p = 0.008). Lower calcium levels were observed in the N + group (p = 0.007), potentially reflecting metabolic abnormalities linked to nephrolithiasis. Nephrolithiasis was independently associated with kidney function decline (B = 3.159, p = 0.038). Follow-up duration was strongly associated with ΔeGFR (p < 0.001). Age showed a trend toward significance but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Asymptomatic nephrolithiasis is associated with accelerated kidney function decline in ADPKD patients. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring kidney stones, even in the absence of symptoms, to mitigate their impact on renal dysfunction. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218692690,Nephrology
Mokhtari R.; Farhangi M.A.,Dietary and plasma atherogenic and thrombogenic indices and cardiometabolic risk factors among overweight and individuals with obesity,2025,BMC Endocrine Disorders,10.1186/s12902-025-01844-0,"Background: Obesity and hyperlipidemia are the two central metabolic disorders linked to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Apart from dyslipidemia, the Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP), which is associated with dietary consumption, is another marker for predicting the risk of CVD. Healthy fat quality indicators may impact AIP. The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether there is any connection between Iranian obese people’s plasma and dietary indices and cardiometabolic risk factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study, consisted of 645 overweight and obese participants. The study included assessments of body composition and anthropometric measurements. Dietary fatty acid consumption was evaluated using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) containing 168 items. Additionally, biochemical parameters, including serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting serum glucose (FSG), and insulin levels, were measured using enzymatic methods. The lipid profile was quantified. Results: For participants in higher tertiles of the AIP, the percentage of men was significantly higher than women (men: 48.1%, women: 51.7%, p < 0.001). Additionally, individuals in higher tertiles of AIP had a higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (mean WHR: 0.92 ± 0.05 vs. 0.86 ± 0.04 in lower tertile, p < 0.001). Participants in the highest tertile of AIP had higher systolic blood pressure (SBP: 132 ± 8 mmHg vs. 118 ± 6 mmHg in lower tertile, p < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC: 210 ± 15 mg/dL vs. 185 ± 12 mg/dL, p < 0.001), triglycerides (TG: 180 ± 20 mg/dL vs. 120 ± 15 mg/dL, p < 0.001), and glucose concentrations (fasting glucose: 105 ± 10 mg/dL vs. 90 ± 8 mg/dL, p < 0.001). Participants in the lower tertile of AIP had higher HDL cholesterol levels (HDL: 60 ± 5 mg/dL vs. 45 ± 4 mg/dL in higher tertile, p < 0.001). In the model for Thrombogenicity Index (TI), participants in the higher tertile had higher glucose concentrations (glucose: 110 ± 12 mg/dL vs. 95 ± 9 mg/dL in lower tertile, p = 0.04). Conclusion: This research introduces a novel field of investigation and emphasizes the possible importance of TI, AI, and AIP indices in regulating cardiometabolic risk factors. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218062963,Dyslipidemia; Hyperlipidemia; Lipid Profile

Method: A dataset derived from the Mashhad Stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorders (MASHAD) study comprising 9354 subject aged 65 − 35. 25% (2336 people) of subjects were diabetic and 75% (7018 people) where non-diabetic was used for the analysis of 10 anthropometric factors and age that were measured in all patients. A K-nearest neighbor (KNN) model was used to assess the association between T2DM and selected factors. The model was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and f1-measure parameters. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and factor importance analysis were also determined. The performance of the KNN model was compared with Artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) models. Result: After feature selection analysis and assessing multicollinearity, six factors (Mid-arm Circumference (MAC), Waist Circumference (WC), Body Roundness Index (BRI), Body Adiposity Index (BAI), Body Mass Index (BMI), age) were used in the final model. BRI, BAI and MAC factors in males and BMI, BRI, and MAC factors in females were found to have the greatest association with T2DM. The accuracy of the KNN model was approximately 93% for both genders. The best K (number of neighbors) for the model was 4 which had the lowest error rate. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.985 for men and 0.986 for women. The KNN model achieved the best result of the models explored. Conclusion: The KNN model had a high accuracy (93%) for predicting the association between anthropometric factors and T2DM. Selecting the K parameter (nearest neighbor) has an essential impact on reducing the error rate. Feature selection analysis reduces the dimensions of the KNN model and increases the accuracy of final results. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731881,Association (psychology)

Using pleural fluid characteristics, pleural infection can be classified into microbiological-positive pleural infection (MPPI) and microbiological-negative pleural infection (MNPI). This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of microbiological positivity in pleural infection, and to evaluate the performance of RAPID (renal, age, purulence, infection source, dietary factor) score in these subgroups. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized for pleural infection over a 10-year period in two acute-care hospitals in Hong Kong were evaluated. According to the pleural fluid characteristics, they were classified into MPPI and MNPI, respectively. Survival was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Performance of RAPID score to predict mortality at 3-month and 1-year was evaluated using C-statistics. Results: In total, 381 patients with pleural infection were included. They were classified into MPPI (n = 169) and MNPI (n = 212), respectively. The MPPI group had more elderly home residence and use of large-bore chest tube, and higher Charlson comorbidity index and RAPID score, compared to the MNPI group. Length-of-stay, the need of surgery and intensive care were similar between the two groups. MPPI was associated with significantly increased risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.46, 95% CI 1.08–1.98). Three-month mortality was significantly higher in MPPI compared to MNPI (24.9% vs. 10.4%, p < 0.001; adjusted odd ratio 2.05, 95% CI 1.11–3.80). The trend continued at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years. RAPID score predicted 3-month and 1-year mortality in both groups (C-statistics, MPPI 0.71, 0.75; MNPI 0.84, 0.81). In the MPPI group, presence of Staphylococcus aureus (aHR 2.26, 95% CI 1.43–3.57) and Gram-negative organisms other than Enterobacteriaceae (aHR 2.00, 95% CI 1.10–3.61) were associated with worse survival, while presence of Streptococcus anginosus group was associated better survival (aHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32–0.78), when compared to their absence. Conclusions: Pleural fluid microbiological positivity is independently associated with increased mortality in patients with pleural infections. This finding should complement the RAPID score in risk stratification and inform future research aimed at improving outcomes in this patient population. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218413948,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Obesity-mediated metabolic abnormalities are one of the mechanisms that link asthma and obesity. While maternal obesity contributes to obesity and respiratory morbidity in the child, the contribution of paternal obesity and parental metabolic abnormalities to the child’s asthma is not known. Methods: To quantify the impact of parental and child’s body weight and metabolic traits, including elevated HbA1c, and blood cholesterol levels based on national, age-specific cut-off values, on asthma exacerbations, control, and severity, in a Danish nationwide cohort of 29,851 children aged 2–17 years with inhaled corticosteroid-treated asthma during 2015–17. Results: Among the 29,851 children, 1,430 had severe asthma, 4,750 had poor asthma control, and 2,353 had exacerbating asthma. Elevated LDL in the child was associated with 2.2-fold higher odds of severe asthma and elevated triglycerides with 1.5-fold higher odds of exacerbating asthma, while reduced HDL was associated with 1.5-fold higher odds of poor control. Both triglycerides and HDL were associated with 1.5-fold higher odds of exacerbating asthma. Maternal parameters including elevated LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1C were associated with 1.2 to 1.4-fold higher odds of uncontrolled asthma in the child. Elevated paternal HbA1C was associated with exacerbating asthma. Conclusion: Dyslipidemia, including elevated LDL and decreased HDL, in the child and their parents was associated with high asthma burden in a Danish pediatric cohort with persistent asthma. These observations highlight the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms driven by fat metabolism that are transgenerational. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010627702,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Methods: This prospective cohort study utilized data from the 6026 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The eGDR (mg/kg/min) was computed as 21.158 − (0.09 × waist circumference [cm]) − (3.407 × hypertension [yes/no]) − (0.551 × HbA1c [%]). The population was categorized into four subgroups according to the quartiles (Q) of eGDR. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to assess the associations between eGDR and ASCVD incidence, and restricted cubic spine (RCS) was employed to examine the dose–response relationship. Results: The mean age of participants was 63.6 ± 10.1 years, comprising 3163 (52.5%) women. Over a median follow-up duration of 14.1 years, 565 (9.4%) developed ASCVD, including 256 (4.2%) myocardial infarctions, 234 (3.9%) strokes, and 358 (5.9%) fatal coronary heart disease. Compared to the lowest quartile, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident ASCVD for Q2–Q4 were 0.87 (0.68−1.10), 0.63 (0.47−0.84), and 0.43 (0.30−0.64), respectively. Per 1 standard deviation increase in eGDR was associated with a 30% (HR: 0.70, 95% CI 0.60−0.80) risk reduction of ASCVD, with the subgroup analyses indicating that age and hypertension modified the association (P for interaction < 0.05). RCS analysis indicated a significant and linear relationship between eGDR and ASCVD incidence risk. Conclusion: eGDR level was negatively associated with incident ASCVD risk in a linear fashion among the general population. Our findings may contribute to preventive measures by improving ASCVD risk assessment. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205216444,Angiology

Methods: We designed a population-based cohort study in individuals without T2D and atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD), divided in two groups according to the presence or not of statin therapy. We also balanced the study groups for demographic and clinical factors using propensity score matching. Results: 119307 individuals without T2D and ASCVD were divided in statin users (N = 90906) or not (N = 28401) and followed-up for 70.1 ± 61.3 months. Yearly incidence of T2D rate was 0.3% in the control group and 2.2% in the statin treated group. A Cox regression analysis confirmed the association between incident T2D and statin therapy. In normotensive individuals, the presence of statin therapy led to a 2-fold risk to develop incident T2D with a HR 2.61 (95% CI 2.11–3.22, p < 0.001) which was also that of statin untreated hypertensive patients. In the hypertensive population statin therapy was associated with a HR of incident T2D of 4.62 (95% CI 3.75–5.69, p < 0.001). CV events rate, including coronary and cerebrovascular fatal and non-fatal events, was 1.9% in the statin group vs. 0.7% in the control group and a multiple regression analysis demonstrated an association between statin therapy and CV events. A further Cox regression performed only in the statin treated population revealed a significant association of CV events with age, serum creatinine levels, and incident T2D. Of note, the increased rate of new-onset T2D associated with statin use does not modify the class of CV risk of this population. All these findings were confirmed at the propensity score matched analysis. Conclusions: Statin therapy in primary prevention is associated with a higher risk of incident T2D, especially in hypertensive patients. However, since the final CV risk of those who develop T2D during statin treatment was lower than the one required for statin prescription according to the ESC guidelines, indicating that this phenomenon does not impair the benefit in CV prevention associated with the lipid lowering effect of statins. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006893568,Angiology; Primary Prevention
Jiang L.; Li Y.; Li X.-M.; Shi K.; Fang H.; Yan W.; Guo Y.; Xu H.; Yang Z.-G.,The adverse effects of metabolic disorder on left ventricular myocardial mechano-energetic efficiency and dysfunction in ischemic cardiomyopathy: insight from a cardiac MRI study,2025,Cardiovascular Diabetology,10.1186/s12933-025-02817-2,"Purpose: Metabolic risk factors (MetF) have emerged as the leading drivers of ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) worldwide. However, in patients who have already experienced myocardial ischemia/infarction, whether and in what pattern the MetF act on the heart needs to be further elucidated. This study aims to determine the adverse effects of MetF on left ventricular (LV) indexed myocardial mechano-energetic efficiency (MEEi) and dysfunction in patients with ICM, and further clarify which MetF classification is more clinically significant. Materials and methods: This study retrospectively included 201 patients with ICM who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, and further divided them into the following three groups according to the number of coexisting MetF: The groups with no MetF (MetF-0 group, n = 32), with 1–2 MetF (MetF-1, n = 92) and with 3–5 MetF (MetF-2, n = 77). The clinical variables and MRI-derived parameters were measured and compared among the three groups. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine independent correlation of MetF on LV MEEi and strain in ICM patients. Results: LV global circumferential peak strain (PS) gradually decreased from MetF-0 group, through MetF-1 group, to MetF-2 group (− 9.52 ± 2.70% vs. − 7.62 ± 2.73% vs. − 6.50 ± 2.70%, P < 0.001). MetF-1 and MetF-2 groups both showed lower MEEi, lower LV global radial and longitudinal PS than MetF-0 group (Both P < 0.001), while there was no statistically significant difference between MetF-1 and MetF-2 groups (P > 0.05). Multivariate analyses indicated that the coexisting any MetF was independently associated with decreased LV MEEi (β = − 0.093, P = 0.018) and PS (Radial, β = − 0.232, P < 0.001; Circumferential, β = 0.156, P = 0.002; Longitudinal, β = 0.192, P = 0.008), and the increase in the number of coexisting MetF was only related to the reduction of circumferential PS (β = 0.238, P = 0.006). Conclusions: Our results revealed whether coexisting any MetF, rather than coexisting a greater number of MetF, is associated with the reduction of LV myocardial mechano-energetic efficiency and dysfunction in patients with ICM, suggesting that clinicians should promptly identify and treat any coexisting MetF in the management of ICM patients. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010136662,Angiology; Cardiac Dysfunction; Diabetic Cardiomyopathy; Ischemic Cardiomyopathy

Identifying prognostic biomarkers may improve risk stratification and guide personalized interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term prognostic value of circulating biomarkers related to inflammation, metabolic stress, and organ damage in individuals with T2D. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on a cohort of 478 individuals with T2D, followed for a median of 16.1 years. Ten circulating biomarkers (IL-6, IL-10, CD163, CXCL9, CCL22, GDF15, IL-33, FGF21, Follistatin, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were quantified using an automated immunoassay platform. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess their prognostic significance for all-cause mortality. A biomarker-based scoring model was developed by integrating independent predictors of mortality. Predictive performance was evaluated in comparison with the RECODe equation, a validated risk model for diabetes complications and mortality. Results: Deceased individuals exhibited significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10, CXCL9, FGF21, NfL, and GDF15. Biomarker levels correlated with both microvascular and macrovascular complications, particularly neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, four biomarkers emerged as independent predictors of mortality: CXCL9 (HR per 1 SD increase 1.19, 95% CI 1.05–1.36, p = 0.006), GDF15 (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.33, p = 0.032), NfL (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09–1.43, p = 0.001), and FGF21 (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04–1.37, p = 0.009). A composite biomarker score (range: 4–12) stratified individuals into distinct risk categories, with each 1-point increase in the score associated with a 55% higher mortality risk (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.35–1.74, p < 0.001). The biomarker score remained independently predictive after adjusting for clinical covariates and significantly improved individual-level risk classification beyond the RECODe model, as demonstrated by net reclassification and discrimination improvement metrics. Conclusions: These findings suggest that inflammatory and metabolic stress-related biomarkers independently predict long-term mortality in T2D. The biomarker-based scoring model enhances risk stratification and improves the prognostic performance of existing clinical tools, such as the RECODe equation, potentially informing targeted clinical interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010228810,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

A high proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma cases are caused by exposure to dietary aflatoxins. Cervical cancer is common among Ugandan women; this malignancy is caused by persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types. An analysis was performed to examine associations between plasma aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) detection and oncogenic HPV detection (HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) and persistence among Ugandan women. Methods: Ugandan women were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Annual cervical swabs (Enrollment, Month 12 and Month 24) were tested for oncogenic HPV. Plasma AFB1 concentration was measured (as AFB1-lysine conjugate, or AFB1-lys) at Enrollment and Month 12. Multivariable regression models were fitted to examine associations of plasma AFB1-lys concentrations and oncogenic HPV controlling for demographic and behavioral characteristics. Results: The analytical sample consisted of 114 women with a mean age of 33.2 years; 60 women were living with HIV; 59 were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at enrollment. AFB1-lysine adducts (AFB1-lys) was detected in plasma from all 114 women. Multivariable regression models showed that plasma AFB1-lys concentration was associated with a higher risk of detection of HPV 16 (OR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.42–4.90, p = 0.002) and HPV 18 (OR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.27–3.96, p = 0.005), and persistence of HPV 16 (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.59–6.26, p = 0.001) and HPV 18 (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.09–3.90, p = 0.025), controlling for age, marital status, years of education, home ownership, distance to health care, number of lifetime sex partners, age of first sex, and HIV status. Conclusions: AFB1 is an environmental hazard that is prevalent among Ugandan women. Higher plasma AFB1-lys concentration was associated with detection and persistence of HPV 16 and HPV 18; this association was independent of HIV status. As a result, these women may be at increased risk of cervical cancer. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms involved. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010217406,Persistence (discontinuity)

In recent investigations, correlations have been found between indices of IR and the incidence of all-cause mortality in various populations. However, such correlations have not been detected among individuals undergoing PD. Hence, the present study’s aim was to explore the connections between IR indices and the incidence of all-cause mortality in PD patients. Methods: Peritoneal dialysis patients (n = 1736) were recruited from multiple PD centres between January 2010 and December 2021. Cox proportional hazards and restricted cubic spline regression models were used to evaluate the connections between the triglyceride–glucose (TyG) index, triglyceride–glucose/body mass index (TyG–BMI), and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio and the occurrence of all-cause mortality. All three IR indices were integrated into the same model to assess the predictive stability. Furthermore, a forest plot was employed to display the findings of the subgroup analysis of PD patients. Results: Overall, 378 mortality events were recorded during a median follow-up time of 2098 days. Among PD patients, a higher TyG index, TyG–BMI, and TG/HDL-C ratio were identified as independent risk factors for all-cause mortality according to Cox proportional hazards analyses (hazard ratio (HR) 1.588, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.261–2.000; HR 1.428, 95% CI 1.067–1.910; HR 1.431, 95% CI 1.105–1.853, respectively). In a model integrating the three IR indices, the TyG index showed the highest predictive stability. According to the forest plot for the TyG index, no significant interactions were observed among the subgroups. Conclusion: Significant associations were found between the TyG index, TyG–BMI, and TG/HDL-C ratio and the incidence of all-cause mortality among PD patients. The TyG index may be the most stable of the three surrogate IR markers. Finally, a correlation was identified between IR and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients undergoing PD. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85203271733,Clinical nutrition; Lipidology

The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a key antigen in vaccine design. However, its low immunogenicity has been a hurdle, resulting in the production of minimal anti-RBD antibodies even when combined with alum adjuvant. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), secreted by Gram-negative bacteria, are nanospherical structures that can display or deliver antigens while also providing adjuvant activity through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Results: In this study, we utilized the SpyTag (ST)/SpyCatcher (SC) bioconjugation system to couple OMV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD in vitro. We successfully prepared a ‘plug-and-display’ nanovaccine OMV-RBD, which demonstrated good safety profiles and promoted the uptake of antigens by DCs and the maturation of BMDCs by activating TLR3 and NOD2 signaling pathways. Both intranasal and intramuscular immunization with OMV-RBD vaccine elicited robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Importantly, the induced antibodies effectively inhibited the binding of RBD to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. Conclusions: This vaccine platform offers an alternative strategy for developing recombinant subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, potentially enhancing immune responses and improving vaccine efficacy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218083107,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Despite extensive research, a systematic investigation using a panel of cell lines, thoroughly characterized label-free nanomaterials, and complementary analytical techniques is lacking. Here, we examined the uptake of thin GO sheets with distinct lateral dimensions in 13 cell lines: 8 cancer (HeLa, A549, PC3, DU-145, LNCaP, SW-480, SH-SY5Y, U87-MG) and 5 non-cancer (BEAS-2B, NIH/3T3, PNT-2, HaCaT, 293T), using confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and flow cytometry. Our results reveal a striking difference in GO uptake: non-cancer cells internalized GO efficiently, while in cancer cells, GO predominantly interacted with the plasma membrane, showing minimal to no internalization. Comparison to other nanomaterials (polystyrene beads and graphene flakes) confirmed that cancer cells internalize materials similarly to non-cancer cells, indicating GO-specific interactions. We identified that GO’s thinness plays important role in this differential uptake. More importantly, GO disrupts the actin cytoskeleton of cancer cells, impairing the migration in cancer but not in non-cancer cells. We propose that thin GO sheets act as a cue upon interaction with the plasma membrane of cancer cell lines, subsequently inducing actin filaments disruption leading to impaired endocytosis, migration activity, and reduced capacity of cancer cells towards GO uptake. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006765539,HeLa; Internalization

Represented by PD-L1, the rise of immunotherapy and multidrug combinations offers a reliable approach to treating LUAD. However, there are still some patients with immunoresistance or insensitivity, and new combination therapies are still needed. Methods: In this study, cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartate (cRGD)/erythrocyte membrane (RBCM) double-head nanocarriers were designed. This nanocarrier platform targets CTRP6 in tumors and delivers gemcitabine to block the progression of lung cancer. PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies were used as a codelivery platform to explore the effect of the codelivery platform on immunotherapy. Results: CTRP6 expression was negatively correlated with the prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The codelivery platform @RBCM/cRGD-PhLips effectively targeted tumor cells. Co-carrying gemcitabine and targeting CTRP6 expression, it amplified ferroptosis of tumor cells through the NRF2/STAT3 signaling pathway, activated intratumoral immunity, and promoted M1-like macrophage transformation and CD8+ T-cell recruitment. This platform amplified the immune effect of PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies to play an anti-lung cancer role.

To address these challenges, we developed TRPC6-targeted dexamethasone-loaded nanobubbles (Dex@NBs-TRPC6)—an innovative therapeutic platform that enables selective podocyte delivery alongside real-time monitoring capabilities. Results: The Dex@NBs-TRPC6 nanobubble system comprises polyethylene glycol-modified lipid vesicles encapsulating dexamethasone (Dex), conjugated with TRPC6-specific antibody for precise podocyte targeting delivery. Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro evaluations demonstrated the robust kidney and podocyte-targeting capabilities of Dex@NBs-TRPC6. Functional assays in mouse podocyte cells revealed that Dex@NBs-TRPC6 significantly outperformed free Dex and non-targeted nanobubbles (Dex@NBs) in mitigating cell apoptosis and inflammation. In an adriamycin-induced mouse nephropathy model, Dex@NBs-TRPC6, administered at half the dosage of free Dex, markedly alleviated proteinuria, glomerular and tubular damage, renal apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Notably, Dex@NBs-TRPC6 attenuated the overexpression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes PCK1 and GCP6, a common adverse effect associated with Dex. Furthermore, leveraging the acoustic response properties of Dex@NBs-TRPC6, this delivery system integrates ultrasound imaging capabilities, enabling real-time visualization and therapeutic monitoring. Conclusions: By simultaneously enhancing therapeutic efficacy, minimizing systemic toxicity, and enabling personalized imaging-guided treatment, Dex@NBs-TRPC6 introduces a transformative approach to GC-based renal therapy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006921824,TRPC6

AGuIX-Bi represents a theranostic NP comprising gadolinium and bismuth chelates grafted on a polysiloxane core. We hypothesize that modulating the surface of AGuIX-Bi with targeted peptides will enhance the therapeutic responses of radiation therapy. The cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) peptide has a high affinity to RGD-binding integrins overexpressed on various tumor cells, including lung cancer. In the present study, we introduced cRGD peptides onto the surface of AGuIX-Bi NPs using a PEG spacer to form an amide bond with the free amino functions present at the surface of the NPs. In vitro, AGuIX-Bi-cRGD showed enhanced internalization of NPs via integrin binding and increased radiosensitization. In murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors, AGuIX-Bi-cRGD exhibited increased accumulation and retention in tumors without causing systemic toxicity. Combined with fractionated irradiation, AGuIX-Bi-cRGD converted a “cold” LLC tumor microenvironment (TME) into a “hot” one by inducing the overexpression of the immunogenic cell death marker HMGB1 and increasing the density of tumor-infiltrating CD3+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and thereby delaying tumor growth and improving mice survival. Therefore, these results suggest a potential strategy for using targeted AGuIX-Bi-cRGD NPs to sensitize lung tumors to radiation and immunotherapies. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009542541,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Schulz M.-C.; Wolff N.; Kopf M.; Gekle M.,Acidosis-induced p38-kinase activation triggers an IL-6-mediated crosstalk of renal proximal tubule cells with fibroblasts leading to their inflammatory response,2025,Cell Communication and Signaling ,10.1186/s12964-025-02180-5,"Background: Local interstitial acidosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces inflammatory responses and dedifferentiation of proximal tubule cells (PTCs), disrupting cellular crosstalk through cytokine and COX-2 metabolite secretion. This promotes a switch to an inflammatory fibroblast phenotype, further exacerbating inflammation and PTC dedifferentiation. p38-signaling and downstream transcription factors, including P-CREB and c-fos, contribute to these responses. This study investigates the impact of acidosis on inflammatory responses in PTCs and fibroblasts, focusing on cellular crosstalk and the role of p38-signaling. Methods: HK-2 (human PTCs) and CCD-1092Sk (human fibroblasts) were exposed to acidic or control media in mono- and coculture for 30 min, 3 h, or 48 h. Protein expression of IL-6, phosphorylated (P-) and total CREB, P- and total SRF, c-fos, and P- and total p38 was analyzed by western blot. IL-6 secretion was measured using ELISA. The impact of p38 and IL-6 receptor activity was assessed by pharmacological intervention. Results: In coculture, acidosis initially caused a transient decrease in IL-6 secretion but significantly increased IL-6 levels after 48 h. Acidosis induced intracellular IL-6 expression in HK-2 cells within 3 h independent of culture conditions, with sustained IL-6 protein increase after 48 h only in coculture. Acidosis also enhanced P-CREB and c-fos expression in coculture during the first 3 h. Regardless of culture conditions, acidosis increased IL-6, c-fos, and P-SRF expression in CCDSK cells after 48 h. P-CREB and COX-2 expression were elevated in CCDSK in coculture. Acidosis-mediated effects on IL-6, P-CREB, and P-SRF expression were p38-dependent in both cell lines. Finally, we assessed the pH-dependency of IL-6 action and found that IL-6 addition increased COX-2 expression via the IL-6 receptor in acidic but not control media. Thus, acidosis enhances IL-6 secretion and potentiates its receptor-mediated biological effects. Conclusion: This study identifies IL-6 as a key mediator of tubule-fibroblast crosstalk in an acidic milieu, promoting inflammatory processes. Acidosis induces IL-6 expression, secretion, and biological effects, with p38 kinase as a crucial mediator. If validated in vivo, these findings could enhance understanding of CKD and support early interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003323785,Crosstalk; Renal tubular acidosis

Nevertheless, the role of lipids in the early steps of carcinogenesis is unknown. Although we previously identified two types of pancreatic fatty infiltration with different lipid compositions that were associated with precancerous lesions and fibrosis, their mechanisms of action have not been clarified. Methods: We hypothesized that saturated palmitic acid and mono-unsaturated oleic acid (OA and PA) could play diverse roles in the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) during the genesis of pancreatic fibrosis and the promotion of precancerous lesions. This study explored the lipotoxic effect of OA and PA on PSCs and exocrine pancreatic tissue (acinar cells). We also explored PA-induced pyroptosis in PSCs. A three-dimensional culture system of organotypic slices from human pancreatic tissues was used as well as a two-dimensional culture of hTERT immortalized PSCs. Results: The results show that PA could induce the secretion of collagens and inflammatory cytokines (IL18) in PSCs (p < 0.05). We defined a standardized protocol of precision-cut pancreas slices cultured from human non-tumoral pancreatic tissue (n = 9). Both OA and PA are involved in the initiation of acinar cell transformation into ductal cells. OA was found to have a protective effect against PA-induced fibrosis (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results highlight the antagonistic roles of oleic and palmitic acids in the initiation of pancreatic fibrosis and show that palmitic acid has a profibrotic role. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002969085,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We sought to develop a novel clinically relevant and easy-to-use score to predict elderly patients’ loss of independence after gastrointestinal surgery. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients age ≥ 65 years enrolled in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database and Geriatric Pilot Project who underwent pancreatic, colorectal, or hepatic surgery (January 1, 2014- December 31, 2018). Primary outcome was loss of independence – discharge to facility other than home and decline in functional status. Patients from 2014 to 2017 comprised the training data set. A logistic regression (LR) model was generated using variables with p < 0.2 from the univariable analysis. The six factors most predictive of the outcome composed the short LR model and scoring system. The scoring system was validated with data from 2018. Results: Of 6,510 operations, 841 patients (13%) lost independence. Training and validation datasets had 5,232 (80%) and 1,278 (20%) patients, respectively. The six most impactful factors in predicting loss of independence were age, preoperative mobility aid use, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, preoperative albumin, non-elective surgery, and race (all OR > 1.83; p < 0.001). The odds ratio of each of these factors were used to create a sixteen-point scoring system. The scoring system demonstrated satisfactory discrimination and calibration across the training and validation datasets, with Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve 0.78 in both and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic of 0.16 and 0.34, respectively. Conclusions: This novel scoring system predicts loss of independence for geriatric patients after gastrointestinal operations. Using readily available variables, this tool can be applied in the urgent setting and can contribute to elderly patients and their family discussions related to loss of independence prior to high-risk gastrointestinal operations. The applicability of this scoring tool to additional surgical sub-specialties and external validation should be explored in future studies. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217463735,Odds

Neonatal clinical manifestations are highly variable and mostly is asymptomatic, but severe infections are described such as myocarditis, meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, coagulopathy, pneumonia and viral sepsis. Since 2022, The World Health Organization has recently reported an increasing number of severe neonatal infection associated with a new variant of Echovirus-11 (E-11). Many of the infants described with E-11 infections in a case reports series were preterm, male and twins. Despite the criticality of neonatal disease, the clinical management remains primarily supportive and therapeutic options are unfortunately few. Case presentation: We present the case of male dichorionic diamniotic late-preterm twins, born in December 2023 at Filippo del Ponte Hospital in Varese (Northen Italy) with early Echovirus-11 infection. They had two dramatically different clinical scenarios and one of them developed a severe and fatal hemorrhage-hepatitis syndrome. Conclusions: Our experience has the purpose to emphasize public health attention to Echovirus-11 neonatal infections and their rare dramatically neonatal clinical presentations. Prematurity, host genetic predisposition and vertical transmission seem to be strong risk factors for severe infections, but it still need to be elucidated. According to previous Italian report, a surveillance protocols in all cases with unexpected clinical presentations and sequencing complete genome in order to better understand typing and molecular characterization of emerging and re-emerging pathogenic variants and new strains are strongly recommend in Italy. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218445331,Echovirus

An increased transcapillary escape rate (TER) of albumin has been demonstrated, though TER does not account for lymphatic return. Mass balance calculations, considering lymphatic return, have been used to assess net albumin leakage (NAL) in major surgery but not in sepsis. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate NAL in ten ICU patients with suspected sepsis, hypothesizing a net positive leakage. Secondary aims included investigating associations between NAL and fluid overload, glycocalyx shedding products, and cytokines, as well as identifying factors associated with it. Methods: This prospective, observational study included ten patients within twelve hours of ICU admission for suspected sepsis at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge. Albumin, hematocrit, and hemoglobin levels were sampled at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. NAL was estimated using mass balance calculations, comparing proportional changes in albumin and hemoglobin concentrations over time, adjusted for albumin and hemoglobin infusions and losses. A proportionally greater decrease or smaller increase in albumin compared to hemoglobin indicated NAL, representing the net leakage from the circulation to the interstitium minus lymphatic return. Results: Over 24 h, patients exhibited a net positive albumin leakage to the interstitium of 8 ± 10 g (p = 0.029). NAL showed no correlation with glycocalyx shedding products or fluid overload but had a weak correlation with interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in the first 4 h. Albumin infusions appeared to increase net leakage. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a net positive albumin leakage of 8 ± 10 g over 24 h in ICU patients with suspected sepsis, with a weak early correlation to pro-inflammatory cytokines but no significant link to fluid balance or glycocalyx shedding. Notably, albumin infusions were associated with increased net leakage. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000758908,Serum Albumin
Pellecchia S.; Franchini M.; Viscido G.; Arnese R.; Gambardella G.,Single cell lineage tracing reveals clonal dynamics of anti-EGFR therapy resistance in triple negative breast cancer,2024,Genome Medicine,10.1186/s13073-024-01327-2,"Background: Most primary Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBCs) show amplification of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene, leading to increased protein expression. However, unlike other EGFR-driven cancers, targeting this receptor in TNBC yields inconsistent therapeutic responses. Methods: To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this variability, we employ cellular barcoding and single-cell transcriptomics to reconstruct the subclonal dynamics of EGFR-amplified TNBC cells in response to afatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that irreversibly inhibits EGFR. Results: Integrated lineage tracing analysis revealed a rare pre-existing subpopulation of cells with distinct biological signature, including elevated expression levels of Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2 (IGFBP2). We show that IGFBP2 overexpression is sufficient to render TNBC cells tolerant to afatinib treatment by activating the compensatory insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1-R) signalling pathway. Finally, based on reconstructed mechanisms of resistance, we employ deep learning techniques to predict the afatinib sensitivity of TNBC cells. Conclusions: Our strategy proved effective in reconstructing the complex signalling network driving EGFR-targeted therapy resistance, offering new insights for the development of individualized treatment strategies in TNBC. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190112661,Afatinib; EGFR Inhibitors; Targeted Therapy; Triple-negative breast cancer

We wanted to find out if there was a link between a lack of 25(OH) vitamin D, HOMA-IR, and lipids and APOE genotyping in obese people with and without T2DM. Methods: We divided 300 Egyptians of both sexes into three groups in a case-control study: 100 obese cases with a body mass index of more than 30, 100 obese cases diagnosed with T2DM, and 100 controls with a body mass index of less than 30. Levels of 25 (OH) vitamin D, fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1C, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and lipid profile parameters were measured, and APOE genotypes were assessed using Applied BiosystemsTM TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays. Results: Higher levels of FBS, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and dyslipidemia were found in obese people with and without T2DM compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Lower levels of 25(OH) vitamin D were also found. Insulin resistance and lipid profile parameters, particularly in obese cases with T2DM, inversely correlate with vitamin D deficiency. The APOE genotyping analysis revealed strong links between vitamin D levels and certain APOE genotypes. Independent of metabolic parameters, higher vitamin D levels were associated with lower odds of E3/E4 and E4/E4 genotypes among obese cases with T2DM. Conclusion: This study highlights the independent role of vitamin D deficiency in modulating APOE genotypes in obese T2DM individuals. The findings suggest potential implications for personalized interventions targeting vitamin D status to mitigate genetic predispositions to metabolic disorders such as obesity and T2DM. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201321871,Apolipoprotein E; Dyslipidemia; Lipid Profile
Cao Y.; Wen W.; Zhang H.; Li W.; Huang G.; Huang Y.,The association between visceral fat metabolic score and stroke: mediation by declining kidney function,2025,Diabetology and Metabolic Syndrome ,10.1186/s13098-025-01608-9,"Background: Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Metabolic Score for Visceral Fat (METS-VF), a metric of visceral obesity, has emerged as a novel predictor of metabolic diseases. However, its association with stroke remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between METS-VF and the risk of stroke, as well as the potential mediating role of kidney function. Methods: Data from the 1999–2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed, including 19,109 participants. Weighted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between METS-VF and stroke risk, with restricted cubic splines employed to explore their non-linear relationships. Mediation analysis examined the role of kidney function, measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses, including propensity score matching (PSM) and multiple imputations, were conducted to ensure the robustness of the findings. Results: Higher METS-VF was significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (OR = 2.78, 95% CI: 1.71–4.52, P < 0.001) after adjusting for multiple covariates. A non-linear relationship was observed, with stroke risk sharply increasing when METS-VF exceeded 7.00. Mediation analysis revealed that declining eGFR mediated 26.72% of the METS-VF-stroke association. Subgroup analysis indicated that the association was stronger in men (OR = 5.06, 95% CI: 2.80–9.12, P < 0.001) than in women (OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.03–3.92, P = 0.04, P for interaction = 0.01). Sensitivity analyses using PSM and multiple imputations confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusions: METS-VF is independently associated with stroke risk, showing a non-linear relationship, with a potential mediating role of declining kidney function. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218187050,Association (psychology); Stroke

Previous evidence has implicated disturbed insulin signaling as a key mechanism that plays a role in both neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and comorbid somatic diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). In this study, we analysed available genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of AD and somatic insulin-related diseases and conditions (SID), i.e., DM2, metabolic syndrome and obesity, to identify genes associated with both AD and SID that could increase our insights into their molecular underpinnings. We then performed functional enrichment analyses of these genes. Subsequently, using (additional) GWAS data, we conducted shared genetic etiology analyses between AD and SID, on the one hand, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolite levels on the other hand. Further, integrating all these analysis results with elaborate literature searches, we built a molecular landscape of the overlap between AD and SID. From the landscape, multiple functional themes emerged, including insulin signaling, estrogen signaling, synaptic transmission, lipid metabolism and tau signaling. We also found shared genetic etiologies between AD/SID and the blood/CSF levels of multiple metabolites, pointing towards “energy metabolism” as a key metabolic pathway that is affected in both AD and SID. Lastly, the landscape provided leads for putative novel drug targets for AD (including MARK4, TMEM219, FKBP5, NDUFS3 and IL34) that could be further developed into new AD treatments. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208000156,Geriatric psychiatry

Both Dapa (a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 or SGLT2, receptor inhibitor) and Saxagliptin (a Di-peptydl-peptidase-4 or DPP4 enzyme inhibitor) are commonly used type 2 diabetes mellitus or T2DM medications, however the benefit of using the combination has not been evaluated for cardio-renal risk assessment, in a real-life practice setting, compared to a placebo. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that Dapa will improve the outcomes when compared to placebo and the Combo maybe even more beneficial. Methods: This is a pilot study evaluating low dose Dapagliflozin 10 mg or low dose Dapa + low dose Saxagliptin combination. 15 subjects were enrolled in 16 weeks, double-blind, three-arm, randomized placebo matched trial, with 10mg Dapa + Saxa placebo (n = 4), 10 mg Dapa + 5 mg Saxa (n = 5) Combo, And Dapa placebo + Saxa placebo (n = 6), Placebo groups. T2DM subjects (age 30–70 yrs) with HbA1c of 7–10%, were included. CD34 + HSC number, migration, mRNA expression along with biochemistry and urine exosomes were measured. Data were collected at week 0, 8, and 16. For statistics, a mixed model regression analysis was used. Results: Significant HbA1c (p = 0.0357) reduction was noted in Combo group versus Dapa alone and Placebo. hsCRP levels (P = 0.0317) and IL-6, two important inflammatory molecules, were significantly reduced in both Dapa and Combo vs. Placebo. Leptin levels decreased significantly in both Dapa alone (p = 0.035) and Combo group(p = 0.015), vs. Placebo, however the Adiponectin levels were higher in Dapa alone group. Dapagliflozin alone reduced lipid parameters significantly particularly triglyceride (TG) when compared to placebo, with resultant visit 3 values at 99.5 ± 7.2 vs. 129 ± 12.3 and LDL/HDL ratio values were similar at 2.18 ± 0.08 vs. 2.13 ± 0.15. CD34 + cell migration improved significantly in both Dapa alone (p = 0.05) and Combo group (p = 0.05) vs. Placebo. Conclusions: Several parameters showed significant improvement with both Dapa alone and Combo compared to placebo. However, when all outcome measures were taken into account, other than glycemic control the Combo didn’t seem to offer any further benefit, over Dapa alone. Therefore, contrary to our initial hypothesis we do not believe the more expensive Dapa + Saxa combination offers any specific cardiovascular benefit compared to Dapagliflozin alone. However it is noteworthy that both Dapa and its combination with Saxagliptin showed significant improvement compared to placebo in T2DM, particularly when progenitor cell based numbers and function were analyzed and taken into account.

Toal M.P.; Fergie R.; Quinn M.P.; Hill C.J.; O’Neill C.; Maxwell A.P.,Systematic review of the application of the Kidney Failure Risk Equation and Oxford classification in estimating prognosis in IgA Nephropathy,2025,Systematic Reviews,10.1186/s13643-024-02739-2,"Background: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world and is an important cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure. Outcomes are heterogeneous, and accurate risk stratification is important to identify the highest risk individuals for treatment and to help prevent disease progression. The Oxford classification (OC) is an internationally adopted standard for renal biopsy reporting in IgAN, which measures the degree of histological abnormalities and predicts prognosis. The kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) was developed to predict kidney failure in all causes of CKD and has been shown to be highly accurate across diverse etiologies. This review aimed to compare the KFRE with formulae incorporating the OC in accurately determining the risk of kidney failure in IgAN. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane library guidelines and PRISMA statement for reporting of systematic reviews. Studies comparing the accuracy of the KFRE with the OC in predicting disease progression and kidney failure in IgAN were evaluated. The search strategy and analysis were performed independently by two reviewers. Studies that were eligible for inclusion compared the KFRE with any tool incorporating the OC in a cohort of individuals with IgAN. Eligible outcomes were reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and prognostic tools were required to assess the accuracy of these formulae by discrimination and/or calibration. Results: After searching several databases, only one study was eligible for inclusion in the review. This study of 2300 Chinese individuals with IgAN had a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Two-hundred eighty-eight individuals had a composite outcome of 50% decline in eGFR or ESRD, and 214 individuals developed ESRD. Both the KFRE and the IgAN Risk Prediction (IRP) tool (incorporating the OC) were highly accurate at predicting ESRD with a C-statistic of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. Subgroup analysis demonstrated improved performance of IRP over KFRE in discrimination for individuals with preserved eGFR (> 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) at baseline. The risk of bias was high due to insufficient follow-up and handling of missing data, so overall confidence in findings is very low. Conclusion: There is currently insufficient evidence to compare the accuracy of the KFRE and OC in determining outcomes in IgAN. Further research is required in this field.

However, the complexity of the gut microbiome, data sparsity, compositionality, and population-specificity present significant challenges. Microbiome data transformations can alleviate some of the aforementioned challenges, but their usage in machine learning tasks has largely been unexplored. Results: Our analysis of over 8500 samples from 24 shotgun metagenomic datasets showed that it is possible to classify healthy and diseased individuals using microbiome data with minimal dependence on the choice of algorithm or transformation. Presence-absence transformations performed comparably to abundance-based transformations, and only a small subset of predictors is necessary for accurate classification. However, while different transformations resulted in comparable classification performance, the most important features varied significantly, which highlights the need to reevaluate machine learning–based biomarker detection. Conclusions: Microbiome data transformations can significantly influence feature selection but have a limited effect on classification accuracy. Our findings suggest that while classification is robust across different transformations, the variation in feature selection necessitates caution when using machine learning for biomarker identification. This research provides valuable insights for applying machine learning to microbiome data and identifies important directions for future work. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214128829,Identification

This study aims to investigate the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (NTM-PD) in areas with a high incidence of TB. Method: This study was conducted at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University from January 2017 to December 2021. A total of 6259 culture-positive specimens were analyzed. Screening was based on acid-fast staining, colony morphology, and p-nitrobenzoic acid detection, which identified 107 suspected NTM strains. Gene sequencing confirmed 51 NTM-positive cases. Results: The predominant species identified were Mycobacterium abscessus (33.33%) and Mycobacterium intracellulare (27.45%). Several risk factors were associated with higher susceptibility to NTM-PD suspect, including bronchiectasis, low serum albumin levels (< 3.5 g/L), and male gender. The study found that although the isolation rate of NTM remained stable over the five-year period, drug resistance rates for the dominant species were notably high. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for clinicians in TB-endemic areas to carefully distinguish NTM infections from TB. The stable isolation rates of NTM, coupled with the high drug resistance of key species, underscore the importance of accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment strategies to manage NTM-PD effectively. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219626735,Endemic diseases

A blend of white mulberry leaf and apple peel extracts may reduce postprandial blood glucose surge and insulin response following dietary carbohydrate intake by limiting its digestion and uptake from the gut. Methods: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study, thirty healthy male and female subjects were supplemented with either placebo or a blend of white mulberry leaf and apple peel extract (MLE + AE), 10 min before a carbohydrate- and sugar-rich meal intake. Changes in postprandial blood glucose (up to 120 min) and insulin levels (at 60 min) were measured as the primary endpoints. Changes in blood glucose incremental area under the concentration curve (iAUC), maximum concentration (Cmax) and peak time (Tmax) were compared. Results: Thirty adults (mean age 31 ± 7.2 years, BMI 24 ± 3.8 kg/m2) completed the study and the MLE + AE blend relative to placebo significantly reduced glucose iAUC at 0.5 h (− 38%, 4.2 (2.2, 6.2)), 1.0 h (− 30%, 6.3 (3.2, 9.4)), 1.5 h (− 29%, 8.2 (4.1, 12.2)), and 2.0 h (− 26%, 9.2 (4.1, 14.3)). A statistically significant reduction in 1 h insulin levels (− 35%, p = 0.029) was observed. Conclusion: A single-dose supplementation of MLE + AE significantly reduced the postprandial blood glucose spike and serum insulin levels. The observation of a significant glucose reduction paralleled with a significant lower insulin response supports a reduced gastrointestinal glucose absorption. None of the subjects experienced any major gastrointestinal side effects. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196220919,Clinical nutrition; Crossover study

To investigate the impact of fermentation on soybean meal’s nutritional value, we detected the protein-related indices and conducted a non-targeted metabonomic analysis on both fermented soybean meal (FSM) and soybean meal (SM) in order to explore changes in a certain type of metabolite and its corresponding metabolic pathways. The results showed a significant increase in crude protein, peptides and amino acids while getting porous after fermentation. A reduction of raffinose and stachyose to 18.1% and 8.5%, respectively, due to the action of α-galactosidase and β-furanofructosidase occurred. As to amino acid metabolites, essential amino acids for human bodily functions such as lysine, histidine, and threonine were significantly upregulated. Furthermore, nine peptide metabolites were identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-IV). After feeding with different doses of FSM, levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), hemoglobin (HB), albumin (ALB), and total protein (TP) of malnourished mice all returned to normal. In conclusion, fermentation with Rhizopus oligosporus RT-3 can improve the quality of SM by reducing the level of oligosaccharide anti-nutrition factors and increasing the contents of free amino acid and small bioactive peptides, which provide a theoretical basis and new ideas for the application of FSM. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003780487,Rhizopus; Rhizopus oligosporus

However, similar progress has not been observed in India, with induction mortality rates surpassing those in high-income countries. Our patient population also differs significantly from those in clinical trials, with about 50% ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Yet, because of limited access to newer therapies and high costs, most of these patients receive intensive therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS In this study, we retrospectively classified patients who received intensive induction into fit and unfit groups on the basis of landmark trial criteria. Data were extracted from the Indian Acute Leukemia Research Database, a prospective registry maintained under the Hematology Cancer Consortium. The primary objective was induction mortality.RESULTS We analyzed 385 patients with AML treated between 2017 and 2019. The median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range, 15-61). Induction mortality was reported at 6.1% in the fit cohort and 20.2% in the unfit cohort (odds ratio, 3.91 [1.97-7.74]; P <.0001). Factors such as increased age, poor performance status, baseline infection, and low albumin were associated with a poor prognosis for early death. After a median follow-up of 19.2 months, the 2-year overall survival in the overall, fit, and unfit cohorts was 62.7%, 67%, and 58.1%, respectively.CONCLUSION Our findings highlight the baseline characteristics of our patient population and their impact on the outcomes of induction therapy.

There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between GAP versus GC. Median OS with GAP was 14.0 months (95% CI, 12.4 to 16.1) and 13.6 months with GC (95% CI, 9.7 to 16.6); hazard ratio (HR), 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.14); P =.41. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was similar between groups with median PFS for GAP being 7.5 months (95% CI, 6.4 to 8.5) versus 6.3 months for GC (95% CI, 4.4 to 8.2); HR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.12); P =.32. In exploratory subset analyses, the OS and PFS benefits of GAP versus GC treatment were greater in locally advanced disease compared with metastatic disease, although not statistically significant (interaction P =.14 for OS and P =.17 for PFS). Moreover, GAP versus GC showed greater improvement in PFS among participants with GBC than those with ICC or ECC (interaction P =.01), but not OS (interaction P =.28).CONCLUSIONThe addition of a taxane in the GAP regimen to the standard gemcitabine-cisplatin regimen did not improve OS in newly diagnosed BTC.

We report protocol-prespecified subgroup analysis of patients with dMMR tumors from the phase III ENGOT-en11/GOG-3053/KEYNOTE-B21 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04634877) in newly diagnosed, high-risk EC after surgery with curative intent. Patients were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo (six cycles) plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (four to six cycles) once every 3 weeks, then pembrolizumab 400 mg or placebo once every 6 weeks (six cycles), respectively. MMR status was a stratification factor. Patients received radiotherapy at investigator discretion. Investigator-assessed disease-free survival (DFS) was a primary end point. No formal hypothesis testing was performed for subgroup analysis. In the intention-to-treat population, 141 patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 140 in the placebo arm had dMMR tumors. At this interim analysis, hazard ratio for DFS favored pembrolizumab (0.31 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.69]); median DFS was not reached in either group. Two-year DFS rates were 92.4% (95% CI, 84.4 to 96.4) and 80.2% (95% CI, 70.8 to 86.9), respectively. No new safety signals occurred.

Kappa free light chain (KFLC) quantification in serum and CSF has recently been proposed as an additional test. In a rational medicoeconomic approach, identifying algorithms or biomarkers is important. The objective of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the correlation between CSF kappa free light chain (KFLCCSF)/total CSF protein ratio (KFLCCSF/ProtCSF) and OCB status and its performance in diagnosing MS. Methods KFLC measurements were performed prospectively with each OCB analysis, and the data were interpreted retrospectively. A total of 814 clinical cases were included: 153 with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 181 with other inflammatory neurologic diseases, and 480 with noninflammatory neurologic diseases. Performances of KFLCCSF/ProtCSF in predicting OCB status, diagnosing MS, and estimating evolution of CIS to MS were evaluated and compared with those of other KFLC parameters, i.e., KFLC index, and with OCB and IgG parameters. Results KFLCCSF/ProtCSF and KFLC index performed similarly in predicting OCB status, with a sensitivity of 80.2% and a specificity of 93.4% at a threshold >0.21% for KFLCCSF/ProtCSF (area under the curve: 0.93). The percentage of agreement between OCB status and KFLCCSF/ProtCSF was 91.2%. Using KFLCCSF and KFLCCSF/ProtCSF initially could reduce OCB testing by 68% and quantitative tests by 48.4%. For diagnosing MS/CIS, KFLCCSF/ProtCSF performed similar to or slightly worse than the KFLC index but always outperformed IgG, OCB, and KFLCCSF. For this indication, the optimal threshold for KFLCCSF/ProtCSF was >0.24%. It is important to note that KFLCCSF/ProtCSF was the most predictive parameter for CIS progression to MS. Discussion To conclude, KFLCCSF/ProtCSF is as an easier and cost-effective alternative for predicting OCB status and CIS progression to MS and assisting in the diagnosis of MS. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class II evidence that the KFLCCSF/ProteinCSF ratio accurately distinguishes patients with CSF OCBs from those without CSF OCBs and patients with MS from those with other neurologic disorders. © 2025 The Author(s).

Because FcRn is a multifunctional protein expressed in different immune system cells, including B cells, we investigated whether FcRn blockade by EFG may have further immunologic effects, other than IgG reduction, in patients with MG.MethodsAnti-acetylcholine receptor Ab-positive (AChR-MG) patients were treated with EFG according to the GENERATIVE protocol. Clinical evaluation, IgG and autoAb quantification, and circulating T-cell and B-cell subpopulation analyses by flow cytometry were performed at different time points. The expression of regulatory plasma cell-related candidate genes (CD38, lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG3], IL-12a, Ebi3) was assessed by real-time PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients on treatment and in PBMCs either untreated or in vitro treated with an EFG-mimicking anti-FcRn monoclonal Ab (mAb) or with EFG (Vyvgart).ResultsA significantly increased percentage of CD19+/CD27+ memory B cells and CD27+/CD138+ plasma cells was observed at the end of EFG treatment cycle 1 and cycle 2 in patients with AChR-MG. Plasma cell increase, maintained up to cycle 3, significantly correlated with Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score improvement. Moreover, PBMCs from EFG-treated patients showed overexpression of CD38, LAG3, and IL-12a genes, suggesting EFG's ability to induce non-pathogenic regulatory plasma cells. This ability was confirmed in vitro, because anti-FcRn mAb-treated and EFG-treated PBMCs displayed an up-regulation of CD38 and LAG3 compared with untreated cells.DiscussionOur findings indicate an unknown immunoregulatory action of EFG in patients with AChR-MG, by unraveling a drug effect on B-cell differentiation, and suggest the induction of regulatory plasma cells as a further mechanism, beyond IgG reduction, associated with clinical improvement. A deep understanding of the immunologic effects of EFG can help to optimize its usage over time in individual patients and disclose biomarkers suitable for monitoring the long-term patient-specific response.  © 2025 The Author(s).",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012305493,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increase AD risk and progression. This study aimed to examine the genetic predisposition to these conditions and their effect on AD pathophysiology, risk, and progression.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a North American prospective cohort. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for OSA, T2D, coronary artery disease (CAD), major depression, and body mass index (BMI) were generated for 752 non-Hispanic White participants with whole-genome sequencing data. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between PRSs and progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Time to progression across PRS quartiles was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. PET amyloid and tau deposition rates, regional neocortical atrophy, and cognitive composite score declines were compared across OSA PRS quartiles using analysis of variance (ANOVA).ResultsAmong 463 ADNI participants with baseline MCI (mean age 72.6 ± 7.3 years, 43.4% female), the OSA PRS, adjusted for BMI, was significantly associated with MCI-to-AD progression. The highest OSA PRS quartile had an odds ratio of 1.86 (95% CI 1.03-3.37) at 3 years and 2.02 (95% CI 1.16-3.51) at 5 years, compared with the lowest quartile. PRSs for T2D, CAD, major depression, and BMI were not associated with MCI-to-AD progression. Participants in the highest OSA PRS quartile had higher PET amyloid deposition and greater cognitive decline. In 752 participants (mean age 74.1 ± 7.3 years, 43.6% female), OSA PRS was significantly associated with baseline levels of PET amyloid, CSF amyloid-β 42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), visinin-like protein 1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, and plasma neurofilament light after multiple testing adjustments.DiscussionIndividuals with high polygenic susceptibility to OSA exhibited an increased risk of MCI-to-AD progression and a higher amyloid deposition rate, suggesting potential modifier effects of OSA or OSA-associated genes on AD progression and pathophysiology. However, the small sample size and lack of objective OSA diagnosis limit interpretation of these genetic effects. © American Academy of Neurology.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216094269,Amyloid (mycology); Association (psychology); Polygenic risk score

In this study, we aimed to investigate the natural course of the function of lower extremity small and large nerve fibers in people with NGT and its decline in those with well-controlled type 2 diabetes. Methods This prospective observational study assessed changes in nerve function in participants of the German Diabetes Study with recently diagnosed (≤1 year) type 2 diabetes and age-matched and sex-matched individuals with NGT after 5 years and in a larger group of participants with type 2 diabetes after 5 and 10 years. Reference tests of lower extremity peripheral nerve function included peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), malleolar vibration perception threshold (VPT), and thermal detection thresholds (TDTs). Data were analyzed using multiple linear or logistic regression analyses. Results At baseline, all 5 nerve function measures showed impairment in the 52 individuals in the diabetes group (33% female, median age 51.7 years) compared with the 52 individuals in the matched NGT group (33% female, median age 51.4 years). After 5 years, 2 nerve indices declined in the diabetes group (peroneal MNCV and VPT) and 3 in the NGT group (peroneal MNCV, VPT, and TDT for cold), with similar 5-year declines observed in both groups after adjustment for baseline values and pairwise matching. In addition, the Neuropathy Disability Score increased in the NGT group but not in the diabetes group. Comparable patterns of decline after 5 and 10 years were found in the larger diabetes cohort of 141 individuals (39% female, median baseline age 53.6 years). The observed 10-year prevalence of abnormal NCVs closely matched estimates based on natural aging-related decline (14.2% vs 12.8% for peroneal MNCV and 30.2% vs 31.0% for sural SNCV). Discussion These findings suggest that nerve function deterioration in well-controlled type 2 diabetes is primarily influenced by nerve function status at diagnosis and physiologic aging, rather than diabetes-related progression.

We hypothesized that muscle-related parameters are associated with the occurrence of postoperative complications. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective observational study. Adult patients who underwent colorectal tumor resection surgery under general anesthesia between 2018.09.01 and 2021.09.01 were enrolled. The last abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan images obtained within 3 months before surgery were used to calculate the L3 SMI and HUAC. The primary outcome was defined as the occurrence of any postoperative complications corresponding to Clavien-Dindo classification before discharge. The secondary outcome was defined as the occurrence of any severe postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3) before discharge. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between muscle-related parameters and incidence of postoperative complications. Patients' baseline demographics, past medical history and intraoperative parameters were adjusted in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 317 patients with a median age of 66 (58-72) years were included. Sarcopenia (muscle mass reduction) patients in our cohort and myosteatosis (muscle density decline) were present in 254 (80.1 %) and 79 (24.9%) patients, respectively. A total of 135 patients (42.6 %) developed postoperative complications. According to the multivariable logistic regression, myosteatosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-3.3, P =.039) was significantly associated with postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: A significant association was observed between myosteatosis and postoperative complications (corresponding to Clavien-Dindo classification before discharge), especially severe postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3) in patients undergoing colorectal tumor resection. Screening for myosteatosis with HUAC using the CT before surgery may help clinicians identify high-risk perioperative patients early.  Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

The current study sought to develop and validate a novel composite endpoint of liver surgery (CELS) to facilitate the generation of more feasible and robust high-level evidence in the field of liver surgery. Methods: Patients who underwent curative-intent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, or colorectal liver metastasis were identified using a multi-institutional database. Components of CELS were selected based on perioperative liver surgery-specific complications using univariable logistic regression models. The association of CELS with prolonged length of stay (LOS) and surgery-related death was evaluated and externally validated. Sample sizes were calculated for both individual outcomes and CELS. Results: Among 1958 patients, 377 (19.3%) met CELS criteria based on postoperative bile leak (n = 221, 11.3%), post-hepatectomy liver failure (n = 71, 3.6%), post-hepatectomy hemorrhage (n = 38, 1.9%), or intraoperative blood loss of 2000 ml or greater (n = 101, 5.2%). CELS demonstrated favorable discriminative accuracy of surgery-related death (analytic cohort: area under the curve [AUC], 0.79 vs external validation cohort: AUC, 0.85). In addition LOS was longer among the patients with a positive CELS (analytic cohort: 14 vs. 9 days [p < 0.001] vs. the validation cohort: 10 vs. 6 days [p < 0.001]). Relative to individual endpoints, CELS allowed a 45.8–91.6% reduction in sample size. Conclusion: CELS effectively predicted surgery-related death and can be used as a standardized, clinically relevant endpoint in prospective trials, facilitating smaller sample sizes and enhancing feasibility compared with single quality outcome metrics. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217385457,Clinical endpoint; Surgical oncology

The aim of this study was to determine which 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy functional indicators can predict post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) in patients before major liver resection due to malignant perihilar biliary disease. In addition, it aimed to assess the efficiency of functional future liver remnant (FLR) assessment of 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy indicators. Patients and Methods: A 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy was performed prior to planned surgery in 187 patients, including 81 patients with major liver resection. The 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy parameters including functional liver volume (FLV), ratio of the FLR functional volume to body weight (FLVFLR–BWR), and predictive residual index (PRI) were calculated from radioactive count in regions of FLR and total liver (TOTAL). Morphological liver volume (MLV) was calculated from computed tomography and standardized by standard liver volume (SLV). The efficacy of these parameters in predicting PHLF was compared using generalized linear mixed models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: PHLF occurred in 22 patients, who showed lower MLVFLR/SLV, FLVFLR, FLVFLR/FLVTOTAL, FLVFLR–BWR, and PRI and higher resection rate (P < 0.05 for all) than patients without PHLF. After adjusting for clinical parameters, a decreased FLVFLR–BWR (odds ratio, OR 0.17; 95% confidence intervals, CI 0.05–0.53) was found to be an independently significant indicator in the model of GLMM. FLVFLR–BWR (0.835) had the highest ROC among all liver functional indicators. Conclusions: The FLR functional parameter preoperatively estimated from preoperative 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy protocol is a promising tool for regional liver function assessment, and it can distinguish high-risk patients who may develop PHLF with malignant perihilar biliary tumor undergoing major liver resection. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005204608,Surgical oncology

This study sought to define the impact of tumor size on the relative therapeutic benefit of AR versus NAR for ICC. Specifically, the study aimed to identify a threshold tumor size to define when AR rather than NAR may be warranted to achieve better survival outcomes for patients undergoing resection of ICC. Methods: Patients who underwent liver resection for ICC were identified from an international multi-institutional database. A multivariable Cox model with an interaction term was used to assess the relationship between tumor size and the survival impact of AR. Results: Among 969 patients, 506 (72.9 %) underwent AR, whereas 263 (27.1 %) had an NAR. Multivariable analysis demonstrated an interaction between tumor size and AR (hazard ratio [HR], 0.94; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.88–1.00; p = 0.045). A plot of the interaction demonstrated that AR was associated with improved outcomes for tumors size ≥4 cm. Among 257 (26.5 %) patients with tumors smaller than 4 cm, recurrence-free survival (RFS) did not differ between NAR and AR (3-year RFS: 65.2 % [95 % CI, 55.7–76.2] vs 58.1 % [95 % CI, 49.2–68.5]; p = 0.720). In contrast, among 712 (73.4 %) patients with tumors size ≥4 cm, AR was associated with improved RFS (3-year RFS: 34.7 % [95 % CI, 27.5–43.8] vs 44.9 % [95 % CI, 40.4–50.0]; p = 0.018). Conclusions: Anatomic resection was associated with improved RFS for ICC patients with tumors size ≥4 cm, indicating that tumor size may be a valuable criterion to determine the extent of liver resection for resectable ICC patients. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003155512,Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma; Surgical oncology

We sought to compare the risk of NTR among patients treated with AR versus NAR as the primary surgical strategy for HCC. Patients and Methods: Patients with HCC within Milan criteria who underwent curative-intent resection between 2000 and 2020 were identified from an international multi-institutional database. The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method was utilized to compare short- and long-term outcomes among patients undergoing AR versus NAR. Results: Among 1038 patients, 747 (72.0%) patients underwent AR, while 291 (28.0%) patients underwent NAR. After IPTW adjustment, patients who underwent AR had better 5-year recurrence-free survival than individuals treated with NAR (63.9 vs. 52.0%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–0.99); however, there was no difference in 5-year overall survival (80.2 vs. 75.6%; HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.55–1.05). Notably, individuals who underwent AR were less likely to have a NTR versus individuals treated with NAR (3-year NTR 9.8 vs. 14.4%; HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.40–0.96). In particular, AR was associated with a lower risk of NTR among patients with a medium tumor burden score (TBS) (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.28–0.99), while the benefit among patients with a low TBS was less pronounced (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.40–1.32). Conclusions: AR was associated with a lower risk of NTR and improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) among patients with HCC, especially individuals with higher TBS.

In this study, we evaluated whether a newly developed commercially available test measuring circulating microRNAs (miRs) could predict PHLF and compared it with other established liver function tests. Patients and Methods: A total of 329 patients undergoing liver resection were included and postoperative outcome was assessed. Our previously described P-score, calculated on the basis of three circulating microRNAs (miR-122-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-151a-5p) using the hepatomiR® CE-IVD test, was evaluated and compared with other predictors of PHLF, namely indocyanine green (ICG)-clearance as well as the combined aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and albumin–bilirubin grade (ALBI) score. Results: Compared with both other liver function tests, P-scores were superior in predicting PHLF and PHLF grades B and C (PHLF B + C) (PHLF B + C: hepatomiR® AUC = 0.835, APRI + ALBI AUC = 0.807; retention rate at 15 min (R15) AUC = 0.690; plasma disappearance rate (PDR) AUC = 0.691). We also documented a superior positive (77%) and negative predictive value (> 90%) for PHLF, along with a close association with postoperative overall survival. A health-economic analysis demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of hepatomiR® in terms of life-years gained due to improved patient risk stratification. Conclusions: The hepatomiR® P-score outperforms established liver function tests utilized in daily clinical practice for predicting PHLF and identifies patients possibly better served with alternative treatments. A health-economic assessment allowed us to demonstrate that optimized preoperative risk-assessment leads to a cost-effective improvement in patient outcomes. © The Author(s) 2025.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007660597,Indocyanine Green; Liver function; Surgical oncology

Methods: This study included 300 HCC patients who underwent TACE treatment. Based on whether persistent albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade deterioration (PABD) occurred after the initial TACE, defining as a shift in ALBI grade to a higher grade from baseline without recovery within 90 days, patients were divided into PABD and non-PABD groups. Overall survival of non-PABD and PABD groups according to subgroups stratified by baseline ALBI grade and tumour burden was compared with that of patients receiving only sorafenib or supportive care during the same period. Results: Repeat TACE provided a survival benefit over systemic therapy or supportive care for patients in all post-TACE non-PABD or most PABD subgroups, regardless of baseline liver condition (ie, modified albumin–bilirubin [mALBI] grade and tumour burden). This benefit was absent in two subgroups among patients who developed PABD after the initial TACE, namely, (1) those with a baseline liver condition of mALBI grade 1 or 2a and tumour burden exceeding the up-to-11 criteria, and (2) those with a baseline liver condition of mALBI grade 2b, regardless of tumour burden. Conclusion: Repeat TACE is not recommended for patients with persistent liver function deterioration after the initial TACE, particularly those exhibiting suboptimal baseline liver function or excessive tumour burden. Understanding the liver condition and tumour burden in HCC patients may assist clinicians in planning optimal treatment strategies, leading to better prognosis. ©2025 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219612859,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Previous research linked PFAS exposure to female reproductive disorders, but the mechanism remains elusive. Further, most studies focused on legacy long-chain PFOA and PFOS, yet the reproductive impacts of other long-chain PFAS and short-chain alternatives are rarely explored. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of long-and short-chain PFAS on the mouse ovary and further evaluated the toxic mechanisms of long-chain perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). METHODS: A 3D in vitro mouse ovarian follicle culture system and an in vivo mouse model were used, together with approaches of reverse transcription– quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), pharmacological treat-ments, in situ zymography, histology, in situ hybridization, analytical chemistry, and benchmark dose modeling (BMD). Using these approaches, a wide range of exposure levels (1–250 lM) of long-chain PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFNA) and short-chain PFAS (PFHpA, PFBS, GenX) were first tested in cultured follicles to examine their effects on follicle growth, hormone secretion, and ovulation. We identified 250 lM as the most effective concentration for further investigation into the toxic mechanisms of PFNA, followed by an in vivo mouse exposure model to verify the accumulation of PFNA in the ovary and its ovarian-disrupting effects. RESULTS: In vitro cultured ovarian follicles exposed to long-but not short-chain PFAS showed poorer gonadotropin-dependent follicle growth, ovulation, and hormone secretion in comparison with control follicles. RT-qPCR and RNA-seq analyses revealed significant alterations in the expression of genes involved in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)–dependent follicle growth, luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated ovulation, and associated regulatory pathways in the PFNA-exposed group in comparison with the control group. The PPAR agonist experiment demonstrated that a peroxisome proliferator– activated receptor gamma (PPARc) antagonist could reverse both the phenotypic and genotypic effects of PFNA exposure, restoring them to levels compa-rable to the control group. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that PFNA could accumulate in ovarian tissues and validated the in vitro findings. The BMD, in vitro, and in vivo extrapolation analyses estimated follicular rupture as the most sensitive end point and that observed effects occurred in the range of human exposure to long-chain PFAS. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates that long-chain PFAS, particularly PFNA, act as a PPARc agonist in granulosa cells to interfere with gonadotropin-dependent follicle growth, hormone secretion, and ovulation; and exposure to high levels of PFAS may cause adverse ovarian out-comes. © 2025, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Epidemiological studies have linked environmentally relevant levels of BPA exposure to obesity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to uncover the complex mechanisms by which oral exposure during pregnancy with BPA affects the offspring. METHODS: We conducted a two-stage mouse study. In stage 1, we gavaged dams with BPA at 0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg/kg per day during pregnancy, and we tracked the offspring’s weight and diet to 12 wk of age. In stage 2, exosomes from BPA-exposed dams and offspring were injected into pregnant mice and 3-wk-old males, respectively, and the mice were observed up to 12 wk. We then sequenced exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in male offspring whose dams had been exposed to BPA during pregnancy and checked their expression in adipose, liver, and serum samples at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Finally, we explored the functions of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs secreted by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and we investigated whether the exosomes and miRNAs they secreted could affect glucose uptake, triglyceride synthesis, and the expression of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism in alpha mouse liver 12 cells. RESULTS: Gavage of 0:05 mg/kg per day of BPA during pregnancy in dams led to obesity in male offspring mice, and injection of exosomes from male offspring with BPA exposure during pregnancy also induced similar outcomes in the next generation of male pups. Exosomal miRNA sequencing identified differentially expressed miRNAs associated with BPA-induced obesity in male offspring, revealing sustained high expression of miRNAs in adipose tissue and a gradual increase in the liver and serum over time. Further mechanistic studies showed that exosomes derived from BPA-treated adipose-derived stem cells reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and fibroblast growth factor 21, leading to impaired insulin signaling and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. Overexpression of miR-124-3p in hepatocytes mimicked these effects; in contrast, knockdown of miR-124-3p or inhibition of exosome secretion reversed them. DISCUSSION: The present study corroborates the regulatory function of adipose-derived exosomal miRNAs in obesity in male offspring mice resulting from BPA exposure during pregnancy. Exosomal miRNA may be a key and novel molecular biomarker in the adverse effects of chemical exposure during pregnancy. © 2025, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are a complex set of modified proteins or lipids by non-enzymatic glycosylation and oxidation. The formation of AGEs is irreversible, and they accumulate in tissues with increasing age. Currently, AGEs, as a biomarker of ageing, are viewed as a risk factor for sarcopenia. AGE accumulation could cause harmful effects in the human body such as elevated inflammation levels, enhanced oxidative stress, and targeted glycosylation of proteins inside and outside the cells. Several studies have illustrated the pathogenic role of AGEs in sarcopenia, which includes promoting skeletal muscle atrophy, impairing muscle regeneration, disrupting the normal structure of skeletal muscle extracellular matrix, and contributing to neuromuscular junction lesion and vascular disorders. This article reviews studies focused on the pathogenic role of AGEs in sarcopenia and the potential mechanisms of the detrimental effects, aiming to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and develop novel methods for the prevention and therapy of sarcopenia. © 2025 Guo et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001931381,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Existing detection methods, such as qPCR and ELISA, fail to simultaneously meet the requirements for high sensitivity, high specificity, and rapid detection. This study presents an innovative approach for the rapid, specific, and highly sensitive detection of pathogenic microorganisms, particularly Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), by combining recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The qualitative and quantitative detection method for pathogenic microorganisms was developed and evaluated. The stable and efficient RPA reaction systems were established to specifically amplify the key conserved genes of these pathogens. Then the RPA products were purified, and enriched with MBs. The absorbance spectra were obtained using THz-TDS technology. The linear range of the RPA-THz for detecting E. coli O157:H7 was 0.55 to 5.5 × 104 pg/mL, while for VZV, it was 0.75 to 7.5 × 103 pg/mL. The limit of detection (LOD) for bacteria and viruses was 0.226 pg/mL and 0.528 pg/mL, respectively, demonstrating better sensitivity than the qPCR (550 pg/mL and 750 pg/mL, respectively). In addition, the whole amplification and detection process was completed in about 35 minutes. Compared to traditional pathogen detection techniques, the primary advantage of the developed RPA-THz method exhibited high accuracy, good reproducibility, and short detection times, enabling non-ionizing, label-free analysis for rapid detection with high sensitivity and specificity of pathogenic microorganisms. This study provides a theoretical foundation and practical demonstration for the fast and precise detection of pathogenic microorganisms. It establishes a crucial research basis for further development of RPA-THz sensors, advancing technological progress in the field of food safety, medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and public health. © 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219116911,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

This allows for the reconstruction of the original spectrum with complex features into a new spectrum with linear characteristics. Furthermore, interference caused by other components and offsets can be eliminated by fitting the new spectrum with a function as the new spectrum has relatively simple features.

Rakowski A.; Monti R.; Lippert C.,TransferGWAS of T1-weighted brain MRI data from UK Biobank,2024,PLoS Genetics,10.1371/journal.pgen.1011332,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) traditionally analyze single traits, e.g., disease diagnoses or biomarkers. Nowadays, large-scale cohorts such as UK Biobank (UKB) collect imaging data with sample sizes large enough to perform genetic association testing. Typical approaches to GWAS on high-dimensional modalities extract predefined features from the data, e.g., volumes of regions of interest. This limits the scope of such studies to predefined traits and can ignore novel patterns present in the data. TransferGWAS employs deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract low-dimensional representations of imaging data for GWAS, eliminating the need for predefined biomarkers. Here, we apply transferGWAS on brain MRI data from UKB. We encoded 36, 311 T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using DNN models trained on MRI scans from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and on natural images from the ImageNet dataset, and performed a multivariate GWAS on the resulting features. We identified 289 independent loci, associated among others with bone density, brain, or cardiovascular traits, and 11 regions having no previously reported associations. We fitted polygenic scores (PGS) of the deep features, which improved predictions of bone mineral density and several other traits in a multi-PGS setting, and computed genetic correlations with selected phenotypes, which pointed to novel links between diffusion MRI traits and type 2 diabetes. Overall, our findings provided evidence that features learned with DNN models can uncover additional heritable variability in the human brain beyond the predefined measures, and link them to a range of non-brain phenotypes. © 2024 Rakowski et al.

In this study, we investigate the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and T2D risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel composed of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids (HDL, IDL, LDL, VLDL) and lipoproteins. By integrating these data with large-scale T2D GWAS from the DIAMANTE meta-analysis through Mendelian randomization analyses, we find 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D, all spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2D liability, spanning almost all tested classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Secondly, using an interaction quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we describe four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions show attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls. The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk, pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. Finally, through differential level analyses, we find 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications, with only a few discriminating between complication classes. Of the 165 metabolites, 40 are not causally linked to T2D in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. Overall, this work provides a map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and on their genetic regulation, enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications. © 2024 Bocher et al.

Haasl R.J.; Payseur B.A.,Fitness landscapes of human microsatellites,2024,PLoS Genetics,10.1371/journal.pgen.1011524,"Advances in DNA sequencing technology and computation now enable genome-wide scans for natural selection to be conducted on unprecedented scales. By examining patterns of sequence variation among individuals, biologists are identifying genes and variants that affect fitness. Despite this progress, most population genetic methods for characterizing selection assume that variants mutate in a simple manner and at a low rate. Because these assumptions are violated by repetitive sequences, selection remains uncharacterized for an appreciable percentage of the genome. To meet this challenge, we focus on microsatellites, repetitive variants that mutate orders of magnitude faster than single nucleotide variants, can harbor substantial variation, and are known to influence biological function in some cases. We introduce four general models of natural selection that are each characterized by just two parameters, are easily simulated, and are specifically designed for microsatellites. Using a random forests approach to approximate Bayesian computation, we fit these models to carefully chosen microsatellites genotyped in 200 humans from a diverse collection of eight populations. Altogether, we reconstruct detailed fitness landscapes for 43 microsatellites we classify as targets of selection. Microsatellite fitness surfaces are diverse, including a range of selection strengths, contributions from dominance, and variation in the number and size of optimal alleles. Microsatellites that are subject to selection include loci known to cause trinucleotide expansion disorders and modulate gene expression, as well as intergenic loci with no obvious function. The heterogeneity in fitness landscapes we report suggests that genome-scale analyses like those used to assess selection targeting single nucleotide variants run the risk of oversimplifying the evolutionary dynamics of microsatellites. Moreover, our fitness landscapes provide a valuable visualization of the selective dynamics navigated by microsatellites. © 2024 Haasl, Payseur.

Amongst Tibetan populations, alleles in the EPAS1 gene - whose protein product, HIF-2α, is a central regulator of the hypoxia response - have repeatedly been shown to carry some of the strongest signals of positive selection in humans. However, selective sweep signals alone may only account for some of the phenotypes that differentiate high-altitude adapted populations from closely related lowlanders. Therefore, there is a pressing need to functionally probe adaptive alleles and their impact at both the locus-specific and genome-wide levels and across cell types to uncover the full range of beneficial traits. To this end, we established a library of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from Tibetan and Han Chinese individuals, a robust model system allowing precise exploration of allelic effects on transcriptional responses, and we differentiated them into vascular endothelium. Using this system, we focus first on a hypoxiadependent enhancer (ENH5) that contributes to the regulation of EPAS1 to investigate its locus-specific effects in endothelium. Then, to cast a wider net, we harness the same experimental system to compare the transcriptome of Tibetan and Han Chinese cells in hypoxia and find evidence that angiogenesis, energy metabolism and immune pathways differ between these two populations with different histories of long-term residence at high altitude. Coupled with evidence of polygenic adaptations targeting the same pathways, these results suggests that the observed transcriptional differences between the two populations were shaped by natural selection. © 2025 Gray et al.

Antagonism or genetic ablation of CD33 has been proposed to treat Alzheimer’s disease, hematological cancers, and as a selection mechanism for enriching genetically altered blood cells. To understand the impact of chronic CD33 loss or ablation, we describe individuals who we confirmed to be missing CD33 due to germline loss of function variants. Through PheWAS-based approaches using existing whole exome biobanks and bespoke phenotyping using recall-by-genotype (RBG) studies, we show that CD33 loss of function alters circulating white blood cell counts and distributions, albeit mildly and with no overt clinical pathology.

In the current study, we employed this cell system to understand the role of pancreatic progenitor differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPF), a protein that has been little explored so far. While the zebrafish orthologue exdpf is essential for exocrine pancreas specification, its importance for mammalian and human development has not been studied yet. We implemented a four times CRISPR/Cas9 nicking approach to knockout PPDPF in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and differentiated PPDPFKO/KO and PPDPFWT/WT cells towards the pancreatic lineage. In contrast to data obtained from zebrafish, a very modest effect of the knockout was observed in the development of pancreatic progenitors in vitro, not affecting lineage specification upon orthotopic transplantation in vivo. The modest effect is in line with the finding that genetic variants near PPDPF are associated with random glucose levels in humans, but not with type 2 diabetes risk, supporting that dysregulation of this gene may only result in minor alterations of glycaemic balance in humans. In addition, PPDPF is less organ- and cell type specifically expressed in higher vertebrates and its so far reported functions appear highly context-dependent. © 2025 Breunig et al.

However, in the process of blood feeding, the mosquito may facilitate the transmission of several bloodborne viral pathogens (e.g., dengue, Zika, and chikungunya). The blood meal is essential as it contains proteins that are digested into polypeptides and amino acid nutrients that are eventually used for egg production. These proteins are digested by several midgut proteolytic enzymes. As such, the female mosquito’s reliance on blood may serve as a potential target for vector and viral transmission control. However, this strategy may prove to be challenging since midgut proteolytic activity is a complex process dependent on several exo-and endo-proteases. Therefore, to understand the complexity of Ae. aegypti blood meal digestion, we used Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS) to generate global proteolytic profiles of sugar-and blood-fed midgut tissue extracts, along with substrate profiles of recombinantly expressed midgut proteases. Our results reveal a shift from high exoproteolytic activity in sugar-fed mosquitoes to an expressive increase in endoproteolytic activity in blood-fed mosquitoes. This approach allowed for the identification of 146 cleaved peptide bonds (by the combined 6 h and 24 h blood-fed samples) in the MSP-MS substrate library, and of these 146, 99 (68%) were cleaved by the five recombinant proteases evaluated. These reveal the individual contribution of each recombinant midgut protease to the overall blood meal digestion process of the Ae. aegypti mosquito. Further, our molecular docking simulations support the substrate specificity of each recombinant protease. Therefore, the present study provides key information of midgut proteases and the blood meal digestion process in mosquitoes, which may be exploited for the development of potential inhibitor targets for vector and viral transmission control strategies. © 2025 O’Donoghue et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219756984,Blood meal; Digestion; Proteolytic enzymes
You H.; Song J.; Kim S.; Oh S.-M.; Hwang J.-H.; Hwang J.-H.; Yoo W.-H.; Choi Y.; Lee C.-S.,Scrub typhus association with autoimmune biomarkers and clinical implications,2025,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,10.1371/journal.pntd.0012766,"Background Scrub typhus, a disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, triggers systemic vasculitis and is prevalent in Eastern and Southern Asia. This study aimed to uncover the relationship between scrub typhus and autoimmune responses, focusing on antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and the implications of elevated ANA titers during infection. Method Data from a total of 139 patients diagnosed with scrub typhus and 30 healthy controls were retrospectively analyzed through serum samples to assess the levels of ANAs and related autoantibodies. The study further examined the temporal variation of these antibody titers in relation to post-symptom progression and evaluated their association with clinical and laboratory parameters. Results The study results detail significant differences in autoimmune responses between scrub typhus patients and healthy controls. ANA titers above 1:80 were detected in 71.2% of patients; these titers were elevated in only 13.3% of the healthy controls. High-titer positivity (1:640 or higher) was observed exclusively in the scrub typhus group. The distribution of ANA titers revealed a progressive increase in mean ANA and double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid Immunoglobulin M (anti-dsDNA IgM) titers as the duration after symptom onset increased, indicating an augmented immune response over time. This trend was observed along with a systematic elevation in median anti-dsDNA IgM titers, highlighting the dynamic nature of immune responses in scrub typhus infection. Conclusion Our findings conclude a substantial autoimmunological reaction in scrub typhus patients, suggesting potential mimicry of autoimmune conditions like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. These results underline the complex interplay between infectious diseases and autoimmunity, emphasizing the necessity for further research into these mechanisms and their clinical implications. © 2025 You et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217357698,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Das G.; Ptacek J.; Campbell J.; Li X.; Havlinova B.; Noonepalle S.K.; Villagra A.; Barinka C.; Novakova Z.,Targeting prostate cancer by new bispecific monocyte engager directed to prostate-specific membrane antigen,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0307353,"Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) represents a well-established biomarker of PCa, and its levels correlate positively with the disease progression, culminating at the stage of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Due to its tissue-specific expression and cell surface localization, PSMA shows superior potential for precise imaging and therapy of PCa. Antibody-based immunotherapy targeting PSMA offers the promise of selectively engaging the host immune system with minimal off-target effects. Here we report on the design, expression, purification, and characterization of a bispecific engager, termed 5D3-CP33, that efficiently recruits macrophages to the vicinity of PSMA-positive cancer cells mediating PCa death. The engager was engineered by fusing the anti-PSMA 5D3 antibody fragment to a cyclic peptide 33 (CP33), selectively binding the Fc gamma receptor I (FcγRI/CD64) on the surface of phagocytes. Functional parts of the 5D3-CP33 engager revealed a nanomolar affinity for PSMA and FcγRI/CD64 with dissociation constants of KD = 3nM and KD = 140nM, respectively. At a concentration as low as 0.3nM, the engager was found to trigger the production of reactive oxygen species by U937 monocytic cells in the presence of PSMA-positive cells. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis of PSMA-positive cancer cells by U937 monocytes when exposed to 0.15nM 5D3-CP33. Our findings illustrate that 5D3-CP33 effectively and specifically activates monocytes upon PSMA-positive target engagement, resulting in the elimination of tumor cells. The 5D3- CP33 engager can thus serve as a promising lead for developing new immunotherapy tools for the efficient treatment of PCa. © 2025 Das et al.

However, in previous meta-analyses, there have been inconsistencies in differentiating between spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated septic patients. Objective To consolidate the literature on the predictive accuracy of changes in the inferior vena cava diameter (∆IVC) for fluid responsiveness in septic patients. Methods The Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, Wanfang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical (CBM) and VIP (Weipu) databases were comprehensively searched. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 15.0 software and Meta-DiSc 1.4. Results Twenty-one research studies were deemed suitable for inclusion. The sensitivity and specificity of ∆ IVC were 0.84 (95% CI 0.76, 0.90) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.80, 0.91), respectively. With respect to the distensibility of the inferior vena cava (dIVC), the sensitivity was 0.79 (95% CI 0.68, 0.86), and the specificity was 0.82 (95% CI 0.73, 0.89). For collapsibility of the inferior vena cava (cIVC), the sensitivity and specificity values were 0.92 (95% CI 0.83, 0.96) and 0.93 (95% CI 0.86, 0.97), respectively. Conclusion The results indicated that ∆IVC is as a dependable marker for fluid responsiveness in sepsis patients. dIVC and cIVC also exhibited high levels of accuracy in predicting fluid responsiveness in septic patients. © 2025 Zhang et al.

However, the results of studies on PLR in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) are inconsistent. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to determine the prognostic value of PLR in predicting functional outcome and mortality in patients with ICH. Methods We searched the databases of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI for relevant studies up to 10th June 2024. The Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was applied to evaluate the quality of the included studies. We calculated the pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) between PLR and both functional outcome (as measured by the modified Rankin Scale, mRS) as well as mortality. Poor functional outcomes were defined as mRS > 2. Results A total of 6 studies with 2992 patients were included. The random effects meta-analysis demonstrated that elevated PLR exhibited an association with poor functional outcome in patients with ICH (OR = 1.69; 95% CI [1.39–2.07]; P<0.0001; I2 = 24%). Similarly, elevated PLR was associated with mortality in patients with ICH (OR = 1.65; 95% CI [1.12–2.43]; P = 0.01; I2 = 31%). Conclusion This study suggested that elevated PLR was significantly associated with poor functional outcome (mRS>2) and increased mortality, indicating that elevated PLR could serve as a reliable a prognostic factor for unfavorable clinical outcomes in patients with ICH. It is advisable to conduct extensive prospective investigations across diverse ethnic backgrounds to verify the accuracy of this correlation prior to its utilization in clinical settings. © 2025 Yuan et al.

We demonstrated previously that TLTs develop in mouse and human kidneys with aging and can be a potential marker of kidney injury and prognosis, and therapeutic targets. In addition, we found that two types of unique lymphocytes that emerge with aging, senescence-associated T cells and age-associated B cells, are essential for TLT formation in the kidney. Although TLTs develop with aging in other organs as well, their cellular and molecular components, and clinical significance remain unclear. In the present study, we found that TLTs developed in the liver with aging, and that their cellular and molecular components were similar to those in the kidneys. Notably, senescence-associated T cells and age-associated B cells were also present in hepatic TLTs. Furthermore, analysis of publicly available data on human liver biopsy transcriptomes revealed that the expression of TLT-related genes was elevated in the liver biopsy samples from hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients compared with those without HCV infection and was associated with liver injury and fibrosis. Therefore, we analyzed liver biopsy samples from 47 HCV patients and found that TLTs were present in 87.2% of cases and that the numbers and stages of TLTs were higher in aged patients and cellular and molecular components of TLTs in humans were similar to those in mice. Our findings suggesting that age-dependent TLT formation is a systemic phenomenon across the tissues and aging is also a predisposing factor for TLT formation across organs. © 2025 Toriu et al.

Meehan C.; Hamilton E.L.; Mansour C.G.; Lecocq S.; Drake C.J.; An Y.; Rodrigues E.; Penner G.,A new method for the reproducible development of aptamers (Neomers),2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0311497,"The development of aptamers has been almost exclusively performed based on the SELEX method since their inception. While this method represents a powerful means of harnessing the in vitro evolution of sequences that bind to a given target, there are significant constraints in the design. The most significant constraint has been the reliance on counter selection on off-targets to drive specificity. Counter selection has not been as effective at driving aptamer specificity as the presence of immune tolerance, the capacity of the immune system to remove antibodies that bind to host targets, is for antibody development. This deficiency has constrained the commercial efficacy of aptamers to date. These limitations have been addressed with our design of a novel platform for aptamer identification. This new design is based on what we refer to as a Neomer library with sixteen random nucleotides interspersed with fixed sequences. The fixed sequences are designed to minimize the potential for hybridization, such that secondary structure is driven by the random nucleotides. The use of sixteen random nucleotides reduces the possible library sequences to 4.29 × 109. This enables the application of the same sequences to either the same target or different targets while maintaining a high level of structural diversity. In effect, this introduces the capacity for reproducibility in aptamer selection and an in-silico approach to replicating immune tolerance. We provide here an overview of the new method and a description of the performance of aptamers selected for interleukin 6 developed using this approach. © 2025 Meehan et al.

This study investigates the association between CKD and several anthropometric indices, including A Body Shape Index (ABSI), Body Roundness Index (BRI), Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), and the Conicity Index (C-index), to determine their predictive capabilities. Methods Based on the datasets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009–2018, weighted multivariable regression analyses were carried out to examine the independent relationship between two anthropometric indices and CKD. Also, subgroup analyses, restricted cubic spline regression (RCS), and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were conducted for further data analyses. Results A total of 24,162 participants were enrolled in this study. After adjusting for confounding factors, ABSI, BRI, WHtR, and the C-index were significantly associated with an increased risk of CKD, while BMI was not. Height showed a protective effect against CKD. ABSI and the C-index demonstrated the highest areas under the curve (AUCs), indicating superior predictive capabilities compared to traditional measures like BMI and waist circumference (WC). Subgroup analyses revealed significant interactions between the anthropometric indices and factors such as age, disease status, dietary intake, and physical activity levels. Conclusions This study highlights the significant associations between various anthropometric indices (including ABSI, BRI, WHtR, and C-index) and the risk of CKD. ABSI and the C-index demonstrated the strongest predictive capabilities for CKD, with the highest AUC values. © 2025 Chen et al.

Additionally, we aim to select biomarkers that have the best evidence-base and should be prioritised for further research. Pub med and web of science databases were searched using “steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome AND biomarker”. Papers published between 01/01/2012 and 10/05/2022 were included. Papers that did not compare steroid resistant and steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome, did not report sensitivity/specificity or area under curve and reviews/letters were excluded. The selected papers were then assessed for bias using the QUADAS-2 tool. The source of the biomarker, cut off, sensitivity/specificity, area under curve and sample size were all extracted. Quality assessment was performed using the BIOCROSS tool. 17 studies were included, comprising 15 case-control studies and 2 cross-sectional studies. Given the rarity of nephrotic syndrome and difficulty in recruiting large cohorts, case-control studies were accepted despite their limitations. We present a range of candidate biomarkers along with scores relating to the quality of the original publications and the risk of bias to inform future investigations. None of the selected papers stated whether the authors were blinded to the patient’s disease when assessing the index test in the cohort. Highlighting a key problem in the field that needs to be addressed. These candidate biomarkers must now be tested with much larger sample sizes. Using new biobanks such as the one built by the NURTuRE-INS team will be very helpful in this regard. © 2025 May et al.

Unpredictable hepatic decompensation complications are a major source of morbidity and mortality. Thus, accurately characterizing disease progression through discrete stages of cirrhosis is critical towards implementing timely intervention and liver transplant (LT) waitlisting. Methods A retrospective, longitudinal, population-cohort study of adult patients with cirrhosis from a US metropolitan area (2006–2012) was conducted. Clinical diagnoses were defined by ICD-9 and CPT codes. Cirrhosis stages were defined as: compensated without portal hypertension (Stage 1), compensated with portal hypertension (Stage 2), variceal bleeding (Stage 3), hepatic encephalopathy (Stage 4a), ascites (Stage 4b), and ≥2 different decompensating complications (Stage 5). Multivariate Fine-Gray competing risk survival analysis adjusted for clinicodemographic covariates. Results Among 12,196 patients with cirrhosis, the mean (±SD) age was 56.8 (±11.7) years with a follow-up time of 2.35 (±1.81) years. A novel 5-stage disease progression framework was used. The 1-year mortality rates for each stage were 7.3% for Stage 1, 5.4% for Stage 2, 11.4% for Stage 3, 10.0% for Stage 4a, 20.2% for Stage 4b, and 43.8% for Stage 5. Compared to those in Stage 1, Stage 3 (sHR:1.83, 95% CI:1.36–2.48, P<0.001), Stage 4b (sHR:1.45, 95% CI:1.23–1.70, P<0.001), and Stage 5 (sHR:1.95, 95% CI:1.71–2.23, P<0.001) patients had higher risks of mortality. Additional disease progression rates were identified. Conclusion Even among patients with compensated cirrhosis, the 1-year mortality rate was as high as 7.3% and subsequently increases with each decompensation complication. This one-year mortality rate is higher than 5-years mortality rate reported in previously known non-US studies. The highest associated risk of death was observed among patients with ≥2 different decompensating complications (95.2%), variceal bleeding (83.2%) and ascites (44.9%). Overall, patients in advanced stages of cirrhosis were more likely to die than they were to receive a LT, suggesting that patients should be referred and waitlisted for LT earlier in the disease process. © 2025 Mohammadi et al.

Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in stroke prevention from inception until April 2023. A network meta-analysis in a Bayesian framework was performed using the random-effects model. Results This study included 88 RCTs involving 487,076 patients to investigate the effects of antihypertensive drugs in preventing stroke. Among these trials, 58 RCTs specifically focused on comparing the impact of such drugs on hypertensive subjects. In overall population, Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEIs), Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), Calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and Diuretics (DIs) demonstrated superiority over placebo in in reducing stroke, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. CCBs and DIs outperformed β adrenergic receptor blockers (BBs), ACEIs, and ARBs in stroke reduction. However, when focusing on hypertensive patients, ACEIs, CCBs, and DIs proved superior to placebo in reducing stroke, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. ARBs reduced stroke and all-cause mortality but lacked efficacy in reducing cardiovascular mortality. Of the various CCB subclasses, only the Dihydropyridines displayed efficacy in preventing stroke, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Among diuretic subclasses, thiazide-type DIs exhibited no efficacy in preventing all-cause mortality. ACEIs+CCBs were more effective than ACEIs or ARBs monotherapy in reducing stroke, more effective than ACEIs, ARBs, CCBs, or DIs monotherapy in reducing all-cause mortality, and more effective than ARBs in reducing cardiovascular mortality. Conclusion These findings suggest that ACEIs, dihydropyridine CCBs, and thiazide-like diuretics may provide superior prevention against stroke, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality in hypertensive patients. Combinations of ACEIs and CCBs may provide enhanced protection of stroke than ACEIs or ARBs monotherapy. © 2025 Yu et al.

Wang F.; Gao Y.,Efficacy of early enteral nutrition support on the nutritional status of patients after gallstone surgery,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0314659,"Objective To evaluate the overall efficacy of early enteral nutrition support on the nutritional status of patients following gallstone surgery, providing a theoretical basis for its application in postoperative care. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 98 hospitalized patients who underwent gallstone surgery between February 2021 and March 2023. The patients were divided into two groups: the study group, which received early nutritional intervention, and the control group, which started nutritional support three days post-surgery. The primary objective was to assess nutritional status, while secondary objectives included gastrointestinal function, immune function markers, and the incidence of postoperative and gastrointestinal complications. Nutritional status, gastrointestinal function, immune function, and complications were compared between the two groups before and one week after intervention. Results After the intervention, the study group showed significantly higher levels of total protein (TP), prealbumin (PAB), albumin (ALB), transferrin (TF), and body mass index (BMI) compared to the control group (P<0.05). Additionally, the scores for Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) and the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) were notably lower in the study group (P<0.05). Postoperatively, the study group experienced shorter times to first exhaust, defecation, bowel sound recovery, first meal, and overall hospital stay compared to the control group (P<0.05). Although the pre-intervention levels of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+/CD8+ were comparable between the groups (P>0.05), these immune markers were significantly higher in the study group post-intervention (P<0.05). The incidence of both postoperative and gastrointestinal complications was significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (both P<0.05). Conclusion Early enteral nutrition support significantly improves the nutritional status of patients after gallstone surgery, enhances gastrointestinal and immune function, and reduces the occurrence of complications. These findings underscore its clinical significance and value in postoperative care. © 2025 Wang, Gao.

Nowak J.; Ssanyu J.N.; Namiiro F.; Mountford N.; Parducci A.; Domijan K.; Daly M.; O’Brien D.; Barden E.; Walshe K.; Doyle S.; Waiswa P.,Diagnosis of neonatal and adult sepsis using a Serum Amyloid A lateral flow test,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0314702,"Sepsis is the overwhelming immunological response to infection, which if not treated can lead to multi-organ failure, shock and death. Specifically, neonatal sepsis results in 225,000 neonatal deaths globally per annum. Moreover, Uganda experiences one of the highest materno-fetal death rates (62,000 p.a.), with neonatal sepsis deaths at approximately 6,500 p.a.. The difficulty in diagnosing neonatal sepsis lies in the non-specific signs and symptoms associated with sepsis and an absence of definitive sepsis-specific biomarkers. However, serum amyloid A (SAA) detection has potential as a superior biomarker for the diagnosis of probable neonatal sepsis. Herein, in ethically-approved studies we have deployed a competitive lateral flow test (NeoSep-SAA (research-use only)) to detect SAA in whole blood at patient bedside in a resource-limited environment. Results are available within 10 minutes and test format is compatible with small blood volumes available from neonates (5 μl). NeoSep-SAA exhibited a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of adult sepsis, and in neonates showed a sensitivity and specificity of 92% (89%, 95%) and 73% (68%, 77%) with PPV and NPV of 78% (75%, 81%) and 90% (86%, 93%), respectively (n = 714 individuals; 95% CI). NeoSep-SAA showed superior sensitivity for neonatal sepsis over C-Reactive Protein detection (sensitivity: 37%), albeit with some sacrifice of specificity. NeoSep-SAA enabled rapid diagnosis, which combined with minimally-invasive blood withdrawal, was less stressful for neonates. Overall, NeoSep-SAA can readily identify infection/inflammation and has the potential to enable rapid and informed clinical decisions to combat sepsis. This approach has potential to improve neonatal sepsis detection and reduce neonatal mortality in line with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.2 objectives. © 2025 Nowak et al.

In this study, we employed an integrative multi-omics approach, including targeted proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and DNA methylation profiling, to investigate the response of a representative panel of GBM patient-derived cancer stem cells (CSCs) to astrocytic differentiation and RT and TMZ treatments. Differentiated CSC progenies retained the expression of key stemness genes and survival pathways, while activating the BMP-Smad signaling pathway and upregulating extracellular matrix components. This was associated with increased resistance to TMZ, though not to RT, across all models. We identified TP53 status as a critical determinant of transcriptional response to both RT and TMZ, which was also modulated by the differentiation state and treatment modality in wildtype (wt) p53 GBM cells. Both mutant and wt p53 models exhibited significant activation of the DNA-damage associated interferon (IFN) response in CSCs and differentiated cells, implicating this pathway in the GBM response to therapy. We observed that activation of NF-κB was positively correlated with the levels of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein, a direct DNA repair enzyme leading to TMZ resistance, regardless of MGMT promoter methylation status, further supporting the clinical potential for inhibition of NF-kB signaling in GBM treatment. Our integrative analysis of the impact of GBM cell developmental states, in the context of genomic and molecular diversity of patient-derived models, provides valuable insights for pre-clinical studies aimed at optimizing treatment strategies. © 2025 Berezovsky et al.

AKI occurs in 10%-42% of AP patients, and studies have shown that early (48 hours) acute pancreatitis associated acute kidney injury (AP-AKI) can increases the risk of death in acute pancreatitis. Anion gap (AG) is a common index in clinical evaluation of acid-base imbalance and an important index in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between baseline anion gap values and early acute kidney injury in patients with acute pancreatitis in intensive care unit. Methods Our data were derived from inpatients admitted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in the United States between 2008 and 2019. A total of 4,017 adult patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to the ICU were enrolled in the study, and 475 were enrolled according to the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Only the baseline value and one day after arrival to the intensive care unit (ICU) were considered for all laboratory test values. According to previous literature and clinical significance, AG was divided into two groups: low value (< 16mmol/L) group and high value (≥16mmol/L) group, and logistics univariate and multifactor regression analysis was applied to verify the relationship between anion gap and AKI risk. Results Only 157 of the 475 AP cases had an AG level below 16 mmol/L, whereas 318 patients had an AG level over 16 mmol/L. Within 48 hours, 89 and 240 cases (56.7% and 75.5%) and the low- and high-AG groups had AKI. In AP cases, an elevated AG was related to an increased risk of AKI [odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.1], and is a nonlinear relationship. When controlling for other factors, this correlation was still significant. Compared to the lower group, high-AG (≥16mmol/L) values can increase the risk of early acute kidney injury in patients with acute pancreatitis (OR = 2.35, CI: 1.57–3.53). Conclusion Anion gap (AG) is an independent risk factor for early acute kidney injury in patients with acute pancreatitis, and has a nonlinear relationship with 48-hour AKI. Higher AG(≥16mmol/ L) values can significantly increase the risk of AP-AKI. © 2025 Zhang et al.

Nam Y.S.; Gi E.-J.; Ko Y.-S.; Lee S.; Cho H.-H.,Trichostatin A suppresses hearing loss by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in an Alport syndrome model,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0316033,"Alport syndrome (AS) is a genetic disorder marked by mutations in type IV collagen, leading to kidney glomerular dysfunction. AS also involves the cochlea, causing late-onset progressive hearing loss. Currently, there are no therapeutic drugs to protect hearing from AS. HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) are chemical compounds that block the activity of histone deacetylase and are known to exert diverse biologic effects. We investigated the effect of Trichostatin A (TSA), an HDACi, to assess its potential to inhibit hearing deterioration in AS. Col4a3 knockout (KO) mice were treated with TSA at 3 weeks of age, and hearing levels were measured using auditory brainstem response (ABR). The results demonstrate that TSA significantly protects the hearing of KO mice compared to the untreated group. The TSA-treated group exhibited a reduction in the levels of oxidative stress markers 4-Hydroxynonenal and 3-Nitrotyrosine, along with a decrease in inflammatory cytokines, in both the mouse cochlea and in vitro HEI-OC1 (House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1) cell and HEK (Human Embryonic Kidney)293T cells. AS demonstrated a thickening in the stria vascular vessels, a phenomenon that TSA attenuated. Col4α3 deficiency showed down-regulation of Hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), a key anti-inflammatory molecule. TSA treatment induced HO-1 signaling, which contributed to the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that TSA represents a promising candidate molecule for mitigating the progression of hearing loss in AS. © 2025 Nam et al.

Schleicher E.M.; Tuchscher J.; Weber M.; Galle P.R.; Wörns M.-A.; Gairing S.J.; Labenz C.,Impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus on results in the animal naming test in patients with and without liver cirrhosis,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0316490,"Introduction and objectives Diabetes mellitus is a common comorbidity in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with the development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and cognitive dysfunction. The simplified Animal Naming Test (S-ANT1) has been established for detecting minimal HE (MHE). It is currently unknown whether S-ANT1 results are affected by diabetes mellitus in patients with and without cirrhosis. Materials and methods This study analyzed data from 268 patients with cirrhosis without signs of HE ≥ 1. MHE was defined using the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES). All patients were also tested with S-ANT1. 14 patients with diabetes mellitus and diabetic foot syndrome but no cirrhosis, as well as 37 healthy controls, were also tested with S-ANT1 and served as controls. Results Type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 79 (29.5%) patients with cirrhosis and MHE according to PHES was detected in 81 (30.2%) patients. In the total cohort, results in S-ANT1 did not differ between patients with and without diabetes mellitus (19 vs. 20 animals, p = 0.108). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, the only variables independently associated with performance in S-ANT1 were PHES-MHE, school education, sodium, and age, while diabetes mellitus was not. Patients with diabetic foot syndrome but no cirrhosis performed poorer in S-ANT1 compared to healthy controls, while patients with cirrhosis and MHE performed poorer than patients with diabetic foot syndrome. Conclusion S-ANT1 seems to be usable for screening for MHE in patients with cirrhosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus, while one might be more cautious when interpreting results in patients with diabetes-related complications. © 2025 Schleicher et al.

She C.; Liu H.,Construction and validation of a predictive model for the risk of osteoporosis in patients with chronic kidney disease based on NHANES data,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0316494,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients tend to exhibit a heightened susceptibility to osteoporosis owing to abnormalities in mineral and bone metabolism. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a nomogram for the prediction of osteoporosis risk in patients with CKD. Methods 1498 patients diagnosed with CKD were enrolled from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data spanning 2005–2010, 2013–2014, and 2017–2018. The dataset was randomly divided into a training set and a validation set in a ratio of 7:3. Utilizing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression technique for predictor identification, followed by employing multivariate logistic regression based on the selected predictors to construct a nomogram. The performance of the prediction model was assessed using various metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results The construction of the nomogram was based on five predictors, namely age, height, weight, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and history of fracture. The AUC of 0.8511 in the training set and 0.8184 in the validation set demonstrates robust discriminability. Furthermore, the excellent calibration and clinical applicability of the model have been thoroughly validated. Conclusions Our study suggests a nomogram, providing nephrologists with a convenient and effective tool for identifying individuals at high risk of osteoporosis and avoiding adverse outcomes related to CKD. © 2025 She, Liu.

Yang S.; Zhang E.; Li Z.; Long Y.; Li Y.; Zhang J.; Wang F.; Liu L.; Wang T.; Guo J.; Hou Z.,Deep vein thrombosis in patients with patellar fractures: Assessing incidence rates and identifying risk factors,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0316628,"Background Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) represents a significant complication following orthopedic injuries, particularly patellar fractures. Despite the prevalence, comprehensive studies assessing the incidence rates and identifying specific risk factors in patellar fracture patients are limited. Methods This retrospective analysis reviewed electronic medical records from 3311 patients treated for patellar fractures at two tertiary hospitals between November 2013 and January 2023. The study focused on patient demographics, fracture characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory parameters to evaluate the incidence and predictors of DVT. DVT prophylaxis measures and diagnostic criteria, including Doppler Ultrasound Scans, were rigorously applied. Results In patients with patellar fractures, the DVT incidence was 30.8%, with 1,790 clots identified in 1,021 diagnosed individuals, predominantly on the injured side (96.7%), and a minor portion on the uninjured side (3.2%). Key risk factors included older age (P<0.001, OR = 1.038), the presence of open injuries (P = 0.002, OR = 1.521), multiple injuries (P<0.001, OR = 3.623), and prolonged time from injury to surgical treatment (P<0.001, OR = 1.097). Conversely, higher levels of albumin (ALB) (P = 0.029, OR = 0.983) and sodium (Na) (P = 0.028, OR = 0.971) were identified as protective factors against DVT. Besides, ROC curve analysis revealed that the age of 52 years and a duration of 4 days from injury to surgery serve as predictive cut-off values for assessing the risk of DVT. Conclusion Our study investigates the incidence of thrombosis in patellar fracture patients and identifies key risk factors for DVT, including age, open and multiple injuries, and the time from injury to surgery. Additionally, we highlight sodium and albumin levels as protective factors. By establishing threshold values for age and surgical delay, our findings improve DVT risk assessment, facilitating earlier and more targeted interventions. © 2025 Yang et al.

Method We used data from 8636 participants in NHANES 2007–2016, which were statistically analyzed by participant baseline study, one-way analysis of variance, multiple regression equations, smoothed curve fitting, and stratified analysis. Result In the fully adjusted model, the DII high concentration group was positively associated with the prevalence of herpes simplex (1.15 (0.89, 1.48), p = 0.0027), and the results of the stratified analyses indicated that the positive association between DII and herpes simplex virus type II was stable in the population. Conclusion This study demonstrates a positive association between DII and herpes simplex virus II in US adults, suggesting that a proinflammatory diet may be an independent risk factor for herpes simplex virus II. © 2025 Luo et al.

We compared HVPG in MASLD with ALD and other etiologies according to cirrhosis complications. Patients and methods In our cirrhosis registry RH7, we identified patients with data on HVPG and scrutinized them against the etiology of advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) (MASLD, ALD, Other) and specific complications of ACLD such as variceal bleeding or ascites. We excluded patients with advanced malignancies and less than 6 months of follow-up. Results We enrolled 220 patients with ALD, MASLD, and Other etiology in 128, 52, and 40 cases, respectively; te median age was 57, 60, and 52 years (P=0.09); the proportion of females was 31, 67, and 55%, respectively (P<0.01). Median MELD scores in ALD, MASLD, and Other etiologies were 16.0, 13.0, and 12.0 (P<0.01), and the median HVPG was 18.0, 14.0, and 11.5 mmHg (P<0.001). In 19, 30, and 25 compensated patients, the median HVPG was 10.0, 11.5, and 11.0 mmHg (P=0.97). In 109, 22, and 15 decompensated patients, the median HVPG was 19.0, 15.5 and 14 mmHg (P=0.01 for trend, difference ALD vs. other P<0.01, ALD vs. MASLD, P=0.295). Between decompensated MASLD and ALD patients, we observed no differences in the proportion of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) (>10 mmHg). Conclusion In our cirrhosis registry study of hospitalized patients with ACLD, baseline HVPG measured for accepted indications differed according to the etiology of dACLD: patients with ALD had the highest values followed by MASLD and Other etiologies. Importantly, when looked at from the point of view of complications, the treshold for clinically significant portal hypertension remained fixed at the level recommended by BAVENO Consensus - 10mm Hg irrespective of etiology. © 2025 Skladaný et al.

Karunaratne N.D.; De Silva S.; Herath M.; Liyanage R.; Weththasinghe P.; Jayawardana B.C.; De Seram E.; Pushpakumara A.; Flavel M.,Effects of supplementing a polyphenol-rich sugarcane extract through drinking water on egg production and quality of laying hens,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0317292,"Polyphenols are a wide group of naturally occurring compounds found in plants and have the potential to safeguard living cells. The objective was to evaluate whether the inclusion of a polyphenol-rich sugarcane extract (PRSE) in drinking water could improve egg production and the quality of commercial layers. A total of 120 Shaver Brown hens, aged 43 weeks, were randomly allocated to 12 litter-floor pens in two open-sided poultry houses. The pens were divided into two treatment groups: one receiving 0% (control) and the other 0.05% PRSE in drinking water throughout the study duration. The treatments were prepared by adding PRSE manually into the drinking water daily, and water was given ad libitum. The birds were given commercial layer feed throughout the study. The number of eggs produced, abnormal eggs, and mortality were recorded daily. Egg weight, yolk colour, yolk height, albumen height, Haugh units, and antioxidant properties, were measured at weeks 45, 47 and 49. Supplementing PRSE in the drinking water did not impact hen-day egg production, hen-housed egg production, egg weight, egg mass, or feed conversion ratio. However, there was a trend toward significance in egg weight at week 45. The results indicated that PRSE supplementation led to a significant reduction in yolk colour during week 45 (P = 0.001), although no differences were observed in subsequent weeks. Yolk height, thick albumen height, and haugh units were unaffected by the treatment, while thin albumen height showed a trend towards reduction in the PRSE group at weeks 47 and 49 (P = 0.05). The DPPH assay revealed a significant increase in antioxidant capacity in the PRSE group at week 45 (P = 0.02). The 0.05% PRSE supplementation in drinking water initially enhanced antioxidant capacity but later adversely affected yolk color and thin albumen height. © 2025 Karunaratne et al.

Li Y.; Tian X.; Sun C.; Wei Y.; Jiang W.; He L.; Li C.; Zhang L.; Wang G.; Lu X.,Outcome of COVID-19 in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy during the Omicron wave in China: A longitudinal observational study,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0317319,"Objective The coronavirus disease pandemic brought unknown challenges to patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, who are often heavily immunosuppressed and have comorbidities. We aimed to investigate the outcomes and risk factors of coronavirus disease in Chinese patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy during the Omicron wave. Methods This observational study included patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy who visited the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. Data on baseline characteristics and coronavirus disease-related information were collected through medical records and surveys, and subsequently analysed. Results Overall, 204 patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy were identified; dermatomyositis was the most common idiopathic inflammatory myopathy subtype. Data were collected from 185 patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 via polymerase chain reaction or antigen tests; of these, 20 experienced a severe course of the disease, and 9 died. All patients with severe coronavirus disease had idiopathic inflammatory myopathy-associated interstitial lung disease, and the most common antibodies observed in patients with mortality were anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and anti-MDA-5 antibodies. Furthermore, 45.0% of patients in the severe disease group took > 15.0 mg of prednisone daily before infection, a significantly higher proportion than that in the non-severe disease group. Advanced age, mechanics’ hands, dyspnoea, chronic cough and fever during the course of myositis, low lymphocyte count, low serum albumin level, and high D-dimer and ferritin levels before infection were prominent in patients with severe coronavirus disease. Albumin levels below 35.0 g/L and ferritin levels above 306.8 ng/mL were independent risk factors of severe coronavirus disease. Conclusion Omicron did not worsen the overall outcomes of coronavirus disease for patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy; however, specific risk factors were identified, highlighting the need for targeted management strategies. © 2025 Li et al.

Despite the available evidence showing a high prevalence of CKD in this population, comprehensive pooled estimate of CKD among PLWHIV receiving TDF based regimen across the globe is lacking. Hence, the present systematic review aimed to provide a global pooled prevalence estimate of CKD. Method We conducted a systematic review of literatures published between January 2000 and May 2024. Articles and grey literature were searched from the following databases and search engine: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of science, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL), and Google Scholar. We included eligible studies that report magnitude of CKD in TDF based regimen. We executed the pooled CKD, subgroup analysis, and funnel plot using random effect model. All statistical analysis including sensitivity analysis were made using Stata 17 software. Results Sixty-nine studies with 88299 participants included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of CKD was 7% (95% CI:6–8). CD4 count less than 200 copies per milliliter, and being female were associated with CKD. Conclusion We concluded that the magnitude of CKD across the globe is high in people living with HIV who have received TDF based regimen. Early identification of CKD by considering regular renal function monitoring, and risk factors especially low CD4 count, and female gender at birth are essential. © 2025 Yazie et al.

Wen H.; Lan Z.; Liang X.; Su H.; Qin Y.,Association between serum albumin levels and erectile dysfunction in American Adults: A cross-sectional study from NHANES 2001-2004,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0318147,"Background The aim of this study is to investigate the association between Serum Albumin Levels (ALB) and erectile dysfunction (ED) within the U.S. general population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001–2004 cycles. Serum albumin was analyzed both as a continuous variable and categorized into quartiles. Erectile dysfunction (ED) was assessed via self-reported questionnaires. The association between serum albumin and erectile dysfunction was evaluated using weighted logistic regression models across four models: (1) Crude model (unadjusted); (2) Model 1: Adjusted for age, race, poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), marital status, education level, and body mass index (BMI); (3) Model 2: Adjusted for factors in Model 1 plus physical activity, smoking status, drinking status, and Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015); (4) Model 3: Adjusted for factors in Model 2 plus remaining potential covariates. A generalized additive model (GAM) was employed to examine non-linear associations, followed by subgroup analyses and interaction tests. Results A total of 2925 participants were included in the study, of which 747 were diagnosed with ED. After adjusting for all covariates, a significant negative association was found between ALB and ED (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29–0.97, P = 0.04). Higher ALB quartiles were significantly correlated with a decreased risk of ED [Q4 vs. Q1: OR: 0.56 (0.35–0.90), P =  0.02; P for trend =  0.03]. The GAM and smoothed curve fit indicated a linear relationship between ALB and the risk of ED. Stratified and interaction tests further substantiated the inverse relationship between ALB and ED prevalence. Conclusions This study revealed an inverse association between ALB and ED. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to recognize the assessment of ALB in patients. © 2025 Wen et al.

Lin C.; Tian J.; Zhang Z.; Zheng C.; Liu J.,Risk factors associated with the recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers: A meta-analysis,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0318216,"Aims Diabetic foot ulcers have caused significant medical, economic and social consequences for patients, families and society. With appropriate treatment, many diabetic foot ulcers can heal, temporarily avoiding possible amputation. Unfortunately, even if foot ulcers subside, recurrence is still common. The recurrence of ulcer has brought another physical and psychological trauma to diabetic foot patients who yearn for a better life. Therefore, it may be more useful to evaluate the factors associated with ulcer recurrence in diabetic foot ulcer patients. Methods The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were comprehensively searched for prospective or retrospective studies published up to February 1, 2024. All English or Chinese language studies on diabetic foot ulcer patients who experience recurrence were included, and RevMan 5.3 software was used to analyze the data. Results A total of 22 studies meeting the eligibility criteria were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. 1861 of 5252 diabetic foot ulcer patients experienced recurrence during follow-up. The following variables were associated with an increased risk of ulcer recurrence: male (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10 ~ 1.44, P = 0.0009), smoking history (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.04 ~ 1.35, P = 0.01), living alone (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.21 ~ 2.86, P = 0.004), plantar ulcers (OR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.41 ~ 4.23, P = 0.001), diabetic retinopathy (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.35 ~ 1.88, P < 0.00001), diabetic nephropathy (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.12 ~ 1.68, P = 0.002), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.45 ~ 2.19, P < 0.00001), foot deformity (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.85 ~ 3.40 P < 0.00001) and peripheral arterial disease (OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 2.43 ~ 3.95 P < 0.00001). However, hypertension (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.96 ~ 1.40, P = 0.13) and body mass index (MD = 0.20, 95% CI = −0.12 ~ 0.53, P = 0.22) were not associated with diabetic foot ulcer recurrence. Conclusions Our meta-analysis identified the following important risk factors for diabetic foot ulcer recurrence: male sex, smoking history, living alone, plantar ulcer, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, foot deformity, and peripheral arterial disease. Understanding these factors and their impact on ulcer recurrence is crucial for multidisciplinary teams to develop management and treatment plans for diabetic foot ulcer patients. © 2025 Lin et al.

Yang P.; Yang B.,Development and validation of predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using machine learning,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0318226,"Objective This study aimed to develop and compare machine learning models for predicting diabetic retinopathy (DR) using clinical and biochemical data, specifically logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks. Methods A dataset of 3,000 diabetic patients, including 1,500 with DR, was obtained from the National Population Health Science Data Center. Significant predictors were identified, and four predictive models were developed. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). Results Random forest and XGBoost demonstrated superior performance, achieving accuracies of 95.67% and 94.67%, respectively, with AUC values of 0.991 and 0.989. Logistic regression yielded an accuracy of 76.50% (AUC: 0.828), while neural networks achieved 82.67% accuracy (AUC: 0.927). Key predictors included 24-hour urinary microalbumin, HbA1c, and serum creatinine. Conclusion The study highlights random forest and XGBoost as effective tools for early DR detection, emphasizing the importance of renal and glycemic markers in risk assessment. These findings support the integration of machine learning models into clinical decision-making for improved patient outcomes in diabetes management. © 2025 Yang, Yang.

Independent associations between Prognostic Nutritional Index and kidney stones were investigated by multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analyses, in addition to exploring nonlinear associations using smoothed curves and threshold effects. Results A total of 13,835 participants aged ≥ 20 years were included, with a kidney stone prevalence of 8.48%. An inverse association was observed between the Prognostic Nutritional Index and kidney stone prevalence (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.96–0.98, P < 0.001). This relationship was not significantly modified by race, education, marital status, or comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. However, sex and total cholesterol levels influenced the association. Stratified analysis showed a significant negative association in men (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96–0.99, P = 0.031), but not in women. A nonlinear relationship was identified in individuals with total cholesterol ≥ 5.2 mmol/L, with a significant negative association below the inflection point of 57 (OR = 0.96, P = 0.012) and a positive association above it (OR = 1.11, P = 0.03). These findings suggest that the Prognostic Nutritional Index is inversely associated with kidney stones, particularly in men and those with high cholesterol levels. Conclusion The Prognostic Nutritional Index was negatively associated with the risk of kidney stones, particularly in men and individuals with high cholesterol levels below the identified inflection point, suggesting that tailored nutritional management may be crucial for these subgroups. © 2025 Wang et al.

Wang W.; Jing P.; Zhao H.; Cheng J.; Yang Z.; He F.; Lv S.,Association between glycosylated hemoglobin and blood lead: A cross-sectional study,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0318580,"Background Diabetes is the most common chronic metabolic disease, affecting many people's health. Previous studies have shown a close relationship between trace elements and metabolic diseases. This study investigated the interrelationship between glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood lead (BPb) in adults. Method This research was carried out involving 12,049 eligible individuals aged 20 years or above from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning from 2011 to 2020. Weighted linear regression models and smoothed curve fitting were employed to investigate the association between HbA1c and blood lead. Analyses were stratified based on age, sex, race, and body mass index, and threshold effects were explored using two-stage segmented linear regression models. Result Among all 12049 participants, through comprehensive adjustment of the model, this study discovered a negative association between HbA1c and blood lead. In addition, when stratified by sex, age, race, and BMI status in subgroup analysis in this study, this correlation still had specific statistical significance. In performing subgroup analyses, we found that the relationship between HbA1c and blood lead may yield distinct outcomes arise from gender disparities. In women, a significant U-shaped association exists between HbA1c and BPb. At approximately 6.6% of HbA1c value, the relationship between the two shifts from negative to positive. Conclusion This investigation proposes a “U” form association between HbA1c and BPb in American adults. © 2025 Wang et al.

Xu Q.; Lin J.; Liao L.; Hu J.; Lu J.,Association between cardiometabolic index and albuminuria: Evidence from NHANES 2017-2020,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0318736,"Introduction Albuminuria is a crucial marker of kidney damage and serves as an early indicator of the risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent studies have suggested that the cardiometabolic index (CMI), could be valuable for screening renal insufficiency. However, the relationship between CMI and albuminuria remains underexplored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between CMI and albuminuria, with the goal of providing new insights for the clinical diagnosis, assessment, and early intervention of kidney disease. Methods The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the period between 2017–2020 provided the data for this cross-sectional investigation. Triglyceride (TG) (mmol/L)/High density lipid-cholesterol (HDL-C) (mmol/L) ×  Waist height ratio (WHtR) was the formula used for calculating CMI. Using multifactorial logistic regression, the independent connection between albuminuria and CMI was investigated. The threshold effect was determined by means of a two-stage linear regression model. Additionally, subgroup analysis and interaction tests were carried out. Results A total of 3,339 participants were included, and 12.38% of them had albuminuria. As the CMI quartiles grew (quartile 1: 7.78%, quartile 2: 13.43%, quartile 3: 12.93%, quartile 4: 17.01%), so did the probability of albuminuria. The results of adjusted model 3 showed that a greater probability of albuminuria prevalence was strongly correlated with CMI (OR =  2.26, 95% CI: 1.58–3.23). This association held true for all subgroups (all P for trend >  0.05). Furthermore, with a two-stage linear regression model with an inflection point of 0.92, we discovered a nonlinear relationship between CMI and albuminuria. Conclusions Our findings indicate that CMI levels are significantly associated with the risk of albuminuria prevalence, suggesting that CMI could serve as a valuable biomarker for assessing the risk of albuminuria. © 2025 Xu et al.

Cho E.H.; Kim J.A.; Park M.-S.; Kwon M.-J.; Park H.; Woo H.-Y.,Mean platelet volume as a biomarker for liver fibrosis in patients with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0318847,"Introduction Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Accurate assessment of liver fibrosis is essential for the prognosis and management of NAFLD. Mean platelet volume (MPV), an index of platelet activation, has been associated with liver fibrosis in various chronic liver diseases; however, its role in NAFLD remains uncertain. Methods This study analyzed data from 70,830 patients with NAFLD who underwent a comprehensive health examination between 2015 and 2019. Patients were stratified into three groups based on the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index: low (<1.30), indeterminate (1.30–2.67), and high (>2.67). We evaluated the differences in MPV among these groups and analyzed the association between MPV and the FIB-4 index. Results MPV varied significantly across the three groups categorized by the FIB-4 index (p < 0.001). Additionally, a weak but statistically significant positive correlation was observed between MPV and the FIB-4 index (rho =  0.170, p <  0.001). Multivariable linear regression adjusted for multiple covariates showed that MPV remained significantly associated with the FIB-4 index (β =  0.01, p <  0.001). Conclusions MPV may serve as a supplementary non-invasive marker for assessing liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Further studies are required to validate these findings and explore the utility of MPV in conjunction with other non-invasive markers. © 2025 Cho et al.

de Oliveira Filho F.J.; da Silva Rodrigues L.; do Amaral S.M.B.; Mellucci Filho P.L.; Medolago N.B.; de Carvalho Bovolato A.L.; de Cássia Alvarado R.; Bertanha M.,Study protocol for a randomized clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of autologous adipose-derived stem cell therapy for ulcers in patients with critical limb ischemia,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0318922,"Background Peripheral artery disease (PAD) can develop into critical limb ischemia (CLI), which is characterized by resting pain at rest, ulcerations, or gangrene, with a high risk of amputation. The optimum course of treatment at this point is arterial revascularization, although this has a significant financial cost and is not always feasible or successful in reducing pain, healing ulcers, or preventing amputations. In situations where traditional alternatives for treating PAD have been exhausted, recent developments in cell therapy may offer a viable substitute. Objective The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of using expanded autologous adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in cellular therapy for the treatment of PAD patients who developed chronic artery ulcers. Methods An open randomized clinical trial will be carried out with two groups of twenty patients with CLI: In group 1, 2g of abdominal adipose tissue will be taken to produce ASCs. These cells will then be expanded in a lab (cell processing center) for 14–21 days before being applied to the lesion using bio-dressings and perilesional subcutaneous injections. Group 2 will receive conventional treatment with hydrogel-based dressing. There will be regular clinical assessments, supplementary tests, and photo documentation. The main efficacy outcome will be partial or complete healing of the wound. Safety outcomes will be monitored for infections, gangrene, amputations, and death. Participants will be monitored for 90 days. Cases of major amputation of the studied limb will not be included. The results will be evaluated by an independent external evaluator who is blind to the groups. Considering the high prevalence and socioeconomic consequences related to CLI and limb amputation, this study is expected to provide a positive social and financial impact on the Brazilian Unified Health System. © 2025 Oliveira Filho et al.

Park S.-I.; Kim S.; Park K.; Yu U.; Jang Y.; Kim B.-H.; Lee J.H.; Kim E.,Predictors of clozapine concentration and psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319037,"Clozapine has superior efficacy to other antipsychotics, especially in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics vary largely among patients. We aimed to evaluate the clinical and genetic factors associated with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clozapine in patients with schizophrenia. Blood samples for clozapine pharmacokinetic assessment were collected from patients with schizophrenia at weeks 2 (visit 2), 8 (visit 3), and 18 (visit 4) from the initiation of clozapine treatment. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score was assessed at baseline (visit 1) and visits 3 and 4. Linear mixed models were used to identify the clinical and genetic variables associated with the clozapine concentration and total PANSS score. A total of 45 patients were included in the pharmacogenomic analysis. Owing to the small sample size, we categorized concomitant medications into four groups. However, individual drugs may have different effects on clozapine concentration. Clozapine concentration was significantly associated with smoking status and cumulative clozapine dose. Clozapine concentration was significantly associated with five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes (rs28371726 and rs202102799 in CYP2D6, rs4148323 and rs34946978 in UGT1A1, and rs2011404 in UGT1A4). Furthermore, follow-up time, body mass index, and total bilirubin levels were significantly associated with the total PANSS scores. The PANSS score was significantly associated with four SNPs in two genes (rs7787082 and rs10248420 in ABCB1 and rs2133251840 and rs762502 in DRD4). This study suggests potential clinical and genetic predictors of clozapine concentration and psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine. With further investigations in diverse populations, our findings may provide important information on variables to be considered in individualized clozapine treatment. © 2025 Park et al.

Zeng X.; Xing Y.-H.; Ma X.-M.; Long Y.; Jiang Z.-Z.; Xu Y.,Proteomic and metabolomic profiling reveals the underlying molecular mechanisms in modified alternate-day fasting-mediated protection against Diabetic kidney disease,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319053,"Background Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease, and while lifestyle interventions like intermittent fasting have shown promise in treating diabetes, the impact of modified alternate-day fasting (MADF) on DKD is not well understood. This study aimed to explore MADF’s effects on DKD in db/db mice, a model for the condition, and to investigate its underlying mechanisms. Methods We implemented an MADF regimen in db/db mice on a high-fat diet, measuring blood glucose, body weight, and renal function at various times. After the intervention, we analyzed the proteome and metabolome of renal tissues. Results MADF was found to reduce hyperglycemia and slow the pathological progression of DKD in the mice. Proteomic analysis identified 165 proteins that increased and 196 that decreased in the kidneys of db/db mice compared to controls. MADF intervention led to a decrease in 26 of the increased proteins and an increase in 18 of the decreased ones. Notably, many of these proteins, including cathepsin S (CTSS), were related to lysosomes, suggesting a role in renal protection. Metabolomic profiling revealed changes in metabolites associated with inflammation, such as prostaglandin A1, which was downregulated in db/db mice and upregulated with MADF. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining confirmed the expression changes of CTSS observed in the proteomic data. Additionally, CTSS expression was found to increase in renal cells exposed to high glucose and palmitic acid. Conclusion MADF appears to mitigate the progression of DKD, with proteomic evidence pointing to lysosome-related proteins like CTSS as potential mediators of its renal protective effects. These findings indicate that MADF and the inhibition of CTSS could be considered as novel therapeutic strategies for DKD treatment. © 2025 Zeng et al.

Melo X.; Lopes A.; Coelho R.; Simão B.; Oliveira I.; Marôco J.L.; Laranjo S.; Fernhall B.; Santa-Clara H.,Acute effects of commercial group exercise classes on arterial stiffness and cardiovagal modulation in healthy young and middle-aged adults: A crossover randomized trial,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319130,"Background Arterial stiffness and cardiac autonomic function are crucial indicators of cardiovascular health. Acute exercise and age impact these parameters, but research often focuses on specific exercise activities, lacking ecological validity. Methods We examined the acute effects of commercially available group fitness classes (indoor cycling, resistance training, combined exercise) on arterial stiffness and vagal-related heart rate variability (HRV) indices in twelve young and twelve middle-aged adults. Participants attended four sessions, including exercise and control conditions, with measurements taken at rest and during recovery. Results Middle-aged, but not young adults, showed reductions in central and peripheral systolic blood pressure 20-min into recovery across all exercise modalities (range: -7 to -8 mmHg p < 0.05). However, arterial stiffness remained unchanged. Similarly, vagal-related HRV indices (range: -0.51 to -0.90 ms, p < 0.05) and BRS (-4.03, p < 0.05) were reduced immediately after exercise, with differences persisting 30 min into recovery only after indoor cycling. Resistance and combined exercise elicited similar cardiovagal modulation and delayed baroreflex sensitivity recovery to cycling exercise, despite higher energy expenditure during indoor cycling (+87 to +129 kcal, p < 0.05). Conclusion Acute group fitness classes induce age-dependent alterations in blood pressure, but not in arterial stiffness or cardiovagal modulation. While the overall cardiovascular effects were generally consistent, differences in autonomic recovery were observed between exercise modes, with prolonged effects seen after indoor cycling. This suggests that exercise prescription should consider both age and exercise modality, as well as recovery time. The findings also emphasize the importance of ecological validity in exercise interventions, highlighting that acute effects on cardiovascular health in real-world settings may differ from those observed in controlled laboratory environments (ID: NCT06616428). © 2025 Melo et al.

Siddique A.B.; Hussain R.; Bhutta Z.A.; Ahmad M.Z.; Khan I.; Alam S.; Malik R.M.; Mammadov A.; Ataya F.S.,"Impact of lufenuron on hematology, serum biochemistry, antioxidant enzymes, and histopathology in broiler chickens",2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319157,"The widespread utilization of synthetic chemicals, including weedicides, pesticides, insecticides, and fertilizers, has contaminated the environment. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the ongoing threat of various stressors, including exposure to synthetic and natural chemicals on various target and non-target living organisms. Lufenuron is extensively utilized in controlling ectoparasites in companion animals and may offer a potential solution for addressing analogous challenges in commercial poultry farming. For this purpose, an experimental study was conducted to estimate the potential toxic effects of lufenuron in chickens. A total of 75 broiler chickens were housed under standard environmental conditions for the period of 39 days following a 7-day acclimatization. Birds were randomly divided into five groups (A-E), each consisting of 15 birds, and administered different doses of lufenuron in groups B-E @ 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/kg body mass, respectively. Various hematological, biochemical, and histopathological biomarkers were assessed in blood and visceral organs. In the current experimental trial, the values of RBC count, PCV, hemoglobin, and MCHC significantly (<0.05) decreased, while WBCs and MCH significantly (<0.05) increased in treated birds. Results showed significantly increased values of renal function tests (urea and creatinine), liver function tests (ALP, AST, and ALT), and cardiac biomarkers (cholesterol and creatinine kinase) in broilers exposed to higher doses of lufenuron. Various histopathological ailments were examined in the liver, kidneys, and heart of the broiler in the dose and time-dependent manner. The current study showed that lufenuron induces oxidative stress, depletion of various antioxidant enzymes, and histoarchitectural alterations in multiple visceral organs. © 2025 Siddique et al.

The renal system and the liver are involved in clearing circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) from the blood. Recent studies on mice show that inhibiting the liver’s ability to clear cfDNA results in elevated ctDNA levels in blood samples. Emphasizing the need for studies in humans exploring if markers of renal and liver function are associated with cfDNA and ctDNA levels in the blood. The present study investigates if cfDNA level, ctDNA level and ctDNA detection is affected in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with clinical biomarkers indicative of low renal and liver function. We requisitioned standard laboratory tests of renal and liver function, measured within thirty days of curative intended surgery from 846 stage I-III CRC patients. For each patient, matching preoperative cfDNA and ctDNA data was available. We investigated the correlation between impaired renal and liver function and cfDNA level, ctDNA level, and ctDNA detection. The findings revealed that variation in renal and liver function in stage I-III CRC patients did not affect cfDNA level, ctDNA level, or ctDNA detection and that ctDNA test results remain stable over a wide range of renal and liver biomarker results. © 2025 Koudahl Conrad et al.

Saha S.; Hossain Md.A.; Ferdousi H.; Deen J.I.; Chowdhury A.; Mannan Md.; Khan Md.A.N.; Rahman Md.A.,Capsicum chinense Jacq. fruit plays an immunomodulatory role in cytokine attenuation and DNA damage protection,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319251,"Capsicum chinense (C. chinense) Jacq., recognized for its bioactive compounds, has attracted interest due to its possible immunomodulatory and DNA-damage-protective effects. This study aimed to assess the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and DNA protection abilities of organic extracts (methanol, ethyl acetate, and petroleum ether) from C. chinense. The immunomodulatory effects were evaluated in Long Evans rats induced with SRBC. At the same time, the anti-inflammatory potential was investigated in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages by quantifying pro-inflammatory mediators such as COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-β, and IL-6. Protective activity against DNA damage was assessed using a method that induces damage with a Fenton reagent. Cytotoxicity was tested on the Hela cell line to gauge the cellular effects of the extracts. The results demonstrated that higher doses (200 mg) of C. chinense methanol extract inhibited immune responses, whereas lower doses helped restore them. The extracts significantly decreased pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines in LPS-activated macrophages. Both petroleum ether and methanol extracts showed higher cytotoxicity against Hela cells compared to the ethyl acetate extract. The protein levels recorded in the serological parameters were 5.74 ± 0.19, 5.36 ± 0.11, 5.74 ± 0.26, 6.02 ± 0.16, 6.18 ± 0.18, and 6.22 ± 0.20 gm/dL for NC, DC, ML, MLMExCC100, MLMExCC200, and MExCC100, respectively. These findings suggest that C. chinense extracts possess strong immunomodulatory effects and potential protection against DNA damage, supporting their therapeutic application in regulating the innate immunity system. © 2025 Saha et al.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with delirium following pancreatic surgery. Methods Data from the patients who had pancreatic surgery between July 2020 and March 2021 in Ruijin Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine were retrospectively analysed. The postoperative risk factors related to delirium were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis. Results 59 of 385 patients (15.3%) developed postoperative delirium after pancreatic surgery. The ROC curve revealed the optimal cutoff of intraoperative fluid balance was 2863ml. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis demonstrated that age ≥  65 years old [Odds ratio (OR) 2.01; 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.12-3.63; p =  0.019], hypnotic drug use (OR 4.17; 95% CI 1.50-11.10; p =  0.005), and intraoperative fluid balance (OR 2.57; 95% CI 1.37-4.84; p =  0.003) were the independent risk factors of postoperative delirium.

Le M.-C.N.; Chen D.; Smith K.A.; Tran D.D.; Fan Z.H.,Microfluidic isolation and release of live disseminated breast tumor cells in bone marrow,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319392,"Breast cancer represents a significant therapeutic challenge due to its aggressive nature and resistance to treatment. A major cause of treatment failure in breast cancer is the presence of rare, low-proliferative disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in distant organs including the bone marrow. This study introduced a microfluidic-based approach to improve the immunodetection and isolation of these rare DTCs for downstream analysis, with an emphasis on optimizing immunocapture, release, and enrichment methods of live DTCs as compared to the standard approach for blood-borne circulating tumor cells (CTCs). EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule), two key cell surface markers in breast cancer, were validated as efficient cell capture targets for DTCs within microfluidic chambers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a combination of 0.25% trypsin and impulse was the most effective for releasing captured cells, maintaining high viability, and preserving essential cellular characteristics. Using a metastatic mouse breast cancer model, we achieved a 47.9-fold enrichment of live DTCs. Analysis of blood and bone marrow samples obtained from a breast cancer patient with minimal residual disease at two timepoints revealed a reduction in CTCs and an increase in DTCs following adjuvant chemotherapy. This observation suggested a potential dynamic interplay between CTCs and DTCs in response to therapy. Our results underscore the potential of the microfluidic approach in enhancing DTC detection and shed light on the importance of monitoring both CTCs and DTCs in breast cancer prognosis and treatment response assessment. © 2025 Le et al.

Wang L.; Tang Y.; Buckley A.F.; Spurney R.F.,Podocyte specific knockout of the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor is podocyte protective in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319424,"Natriuretic peptides (NPs) bind to glomerular podocytes and attenuate glomerular injury. The beneficial effects of NPs are negatively regulated by the NP clearance receptor (NPRC), which is highly expressed in podocytes. To determine if inhibiting NPRC is podocyte protective, we examined the effects of deleting NPRC in both cultured podocytes and in vivo. We found that: 1.Both atrial NP and C-type NP inhibit podocyte apoptosis in cultured podocytes, but these podocyte protective effects are significantly attenuated in cells expressing NPRC, and 2. Atrial NP was significantly more effective than CNP at inhibiting the apoptotic response. Consistent with the protective actions of NPs, podocyte specific knockout of NPRC reduced albuminuria, glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial inflammation in a mouse model of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. These beneficial actions were associated with: 1. Decreased expression of the myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth muscle actin, 2. Reduced expression of the extracellular matrix proteins collagen 4-alpha-1 and fibronectin, and 3. Preserved expression of the podocyte proteins nephrin and podocin. Inhibiting NP clearance may be a useful therapeutic approach to treat glomerular diseases. © 2025 Wang et al.

Materials and Methods Between July 2017 and December 2022, lymphoma patients diagnosed at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University who underwent 6 cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy and had baseline and 6-cycle oncological 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were included. A total of 366 patients with complete data sets were enrolled. Relevant parameters including blood tests, lipid profile, cardiac biomarkers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin (ALB), β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), and cardiac ultrasound findings were collected. Patients were monitored from the initiation of chemotherapy until January 2024, and the occurrence of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity (CTR-CVT) was documented. Changes in PET/CT heart uptake patterns pre- and post-treatment, along with the presence or absence of CTR-CVT, were used to analyze alterations in left ventricular and epicardial adipose tissue metabolic parameters, as well as changes in echocardiographic parameters. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify risk factors for CTR-CVT. Results Among lymphoma patients who received 6 cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy, compared to their initial state, there was a notable decrease in white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) levels post-treatment. Conversely, albumin (ALB) levels and blood lipid levels significantly rose after treatment. Post-treatment, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) of the left ventricle significantly increased, and the percentage of patients exhibiting no uptake pattern in the left ventricle significantly decreased, while those with diffuse uptake pattern notably increased. Moreover, the count of patients with abnormal cardiac uptake significantly rose post-treatment. Analyzing changes in uptake patterns, the group displaying abnormal changes exhibited an increase in left atrial diameter and a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction compared to the group with normal changes. The SUVmax of the epicardial adipose tissue was notably higher in the abnormal change group compared to the normal change group. Based on the presence or absence of CTR-CVT, the CTR-CVT group showcased higher left atrial diameter and left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction compared to the non-CTR-CVT group. Additionally, the SUVmax and SUVmean of the epicardial adipose tissue were higher in the CTR-CVT group than in the non-CTR-CVT group. Left atrial end-systolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, SUVmax of the epicardial adipose tissue, and change in uptake pattern were identified as risk factors for CTR-CVT. Conclusion In lymphoma patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, alterations in 18F-FDG PET/CT cardiac uptake patterns and metabolic parameters observed during the follow-up period before and after treatment, as well as changes in epicardial adipose tissue metabolic parameters post-treatment, could serve as predictors for the occurrence of CTR-CVT. © 2025 Lin et al.

Riezk A.; O’Keeffe A.; Van Bocxlaer K.; Yardley V.; Croft S.L.,Comparative assessment of macrophage responses and antileishmanial efficacy in dynamic vs. Static culture systems utilizing chitosan-based formulations,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319610,"The discovery of novel anti-leishmanial compounds is essential due to the limitations of current treatments and the lack of new drugs in development. In this study, we employed the Quasi Vivo 900 medium perfusion system (QV900, Kirkstall Ltd, UK) to simulate physiological fluid flow, allowing us to compare macrophage responses and therapeutic outcomes under dynamic versus static conditions. After 24 hours, phagocytosis and macropinocytosis decreased in all cell types under flow conditions compared to static cultures. Under slow (1.45 x 10-9 m/s) and faster (1.23 x 10-7 m/s) flow conditions ((simulating in vivo lymphatic flow), phagocytosis decreased by around 42.55% and 56.98% in peritoneal macrophages (PEMs), 42.21% and 56.11% in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), and 49.75% and 63.32% in THP-1 cells, respectively. Similarly, macropinocytosis decreased by approximately 40.7% and 62.2% in PEMs, 34.8% and 60.9% in BMMs, and 33.3% and 59.3% in THP-1 cell line under this same conditions. In this study, we further assessed the impact of medium perfusion on drug efficacy and macrophage functions using a Leishmania major amastigote-macrophage assay. We evaluated the performance of both standard and nanoparticle-based drug formulations within dynamic and static culture systems. After 72 hours of medium perfusion, chitosan solution, blank chitosan-sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles, and amphotericin B (AmB)-loaded chitosan-TPP nanoparticles exhibited a statistically significant reduction in antileishmanial activity by approximately 30-50% under slow flow conditions and 60-80% under faster flow conditions. In comparison, pure AmB showed a 40% decrease in efficacy at slow flow and a 67% decrease at faster flow, both statistically significant. These results highlighted the importance of considering fluid flow dynamics in in vitro studies for a more accurate simulation of in vivo conditions, potentially leading to better therapeutic strategies for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). © 2025 Riezk et al.

This study aimed to determine sex differences in factors associated with anemia in PLWH at Livingstone University Teaching Hospital, Zambia. Methods This cross-sectional study involved 631 PLWH aged 18 years or older who had been on combinational ART for at least 6 months. Data was collected via standardized questionnaires and medical records. Anemia was defined as haemoglobin levels < 13 g/dL for men and < 12 g/dL for women, based on WHO criteria. Logistic regression models assessed the associated factors, stratified by sex. Results Participants had a median age of 44 years, with a female preponderance of 64.2%. The overall prevalence of anemia was 36%, significantly higher in females (41.1%) compared to males (27.2%) (p < 0.001). In females, waist circumference (AOR =  0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99, P =  0.018), albumin levels (AOR =  0.96, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99, P =  0.047), NNRTI regimens (AOR =  2.78, 95% CI: 1.34-5.78, P =  0.006), microcytosis (AOR =  3.18, 95% CI: 1.26-8.03, P =  0.014), and hypertension (OR =  0.34, 95% CI: 0.13-0.87, P = 0.024) were linked to anemia in adjusted analysis but these associations were abrogated by male sex. Conclusions We found a 36% prevalence of anemia among PLWH, with a higher prevalence in females (41%) compared to males (27%), including severe forms of anemia. Among females, anemia was linked to lower waist circumference, lower albumin levels, NNRTI regimens, microcytosis, and blood pressure but not males.

Lin L.; Xie Y.; Lin Z.; Lin C.; Yang Y.,Machine learning for predicting metabolic-associated fatty liver disease including NHHR: a cross-sectional NHANES study,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319851,"Objective Metabolic - associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a common hepatic disorder with increasing prevalence, and early detection remains inadequately achieved. This study aims to explore the relationship between the non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHHR) and MAFLD, and to establish a predictive model for MAFLD using NHHR as a key variable. Methods All participants were selected from the NHANES cohort, spanning from 2017 to March 2020. Multiple linear regression models were employed to examine the relationship between the non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHHR) and the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). To explore the non-linear association between NHHR and CAP, smooth curve fitting and restricted cubic splines (RCS) of the adjusted variables were utilized. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify variations in the relationships between the independent and dependent variables across different populations. Finally, a metabolic - associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) prediction model was developed using seven machine learning methods, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and logistic regression. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) value was employed to interpret the importance of various features. Result Weighted multiple linear regression models revealed a significant positive correlation between the NHHR and the CAP (Beta = 7.42, 95% CI: 5.35-9.50, P < 0.001). Smooth curve fitting and RCS demonstrated a non-linear relationship between NHHR and CAP. Subgroup analyses indicated that this relationship was more pronounced in females. Among the seven machine learning predictive models incorporating NHHR, the XGBoost algorithm exhibited the highest predictive performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.828. Furthermore, NHHR was identified as the second most important feature in the SHAP analysis, following body mass index (BMI), highlighting its potential in predicting MAFLD. Conclusion A significant positive correlation was identified between the NHHR and the CAP. The inclusion of NHHR in the XGBoost predictive model for MAFLD demonstrated robust predictive capability, providing a valuable tool for the early detection of MAFLD with considerable clinical application potential. © 2025 Lin et al.

However, both hypovolemia and excessive fluid administration can impair organ perfusion, increasing the risk of renal dysfunction and acute kidney injury (AKI). This study explores the relationship between perioperative fluid management strategies and renal outcomes in patients undergoing hepatectomy. Method A retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted involving 691 patients who underwent an open hepatectomy. Patients were categorized by positive fluid balance: <1 Liter, 1-2 Liters, and >2 Liters. Propensity score was used for matching among the groups. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was compared. Multivariable logistic regression analyzed the correlation between fluid balance and AKI risk. Result The overall incidence of AKI was 11.58%, with the highest occurrence in the group with a fluid balance greater than 2 Liters. This group demonstrated a significantly higher relative risk of developing AKI compared to those with positive fluid balances of <1 Liter and 1-2 Liters (adjusted RR 1.85, p = 0.042, 95% CI 1.02-3.38). An increase in fluid balance was associated with a higher incidence rate ratio for AKI (p = 0.016). Additionally, an operating time >5 hours, blood loss >1000 ml, and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B and C were significantly associated with an increased risk of post-hepatectomy AKI. Conclusion Maintaining a fluid balance of 1-2 liters during hepatectomy is crucial to reducing the risk of postoperative AKI, while balances above 2 liters significantly increase it. Prolonged operating times, high blood loss, and advanced liver disease also elevate AKI risk, emphasizing the need for careful fluid management. © 2025 Phothikun et al.

Zhang G.; Xu B.; Zhao X.,"Red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio as a novel predictor for mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: Results from the cohort study of NHANES, 1999-2018",2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319869,"Objectives To investigate the association of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to albumin ratio (RAR) with mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Methods We selected 1,652 patients with COPD from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2018, who were categorized into four groups according to the RAR quartiles. Kaplan-Meier curves, restricted cubic splines and the Cox proportional hazard model were used to evaluate the associations between RAR and all-cause mortality and chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD) mortality in the COPD patients. Subgroup analyses were performed to check the interaction of the different characteristics. Results There were 640 deaths during follow-up, of which, 145 were from CLRD. Kaplan-Meier curves indicated COPD patients with higher RAR had significantly increased all-cause mortality and CLRD mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed HR of Q4 RAR was 2.88 (95% CI 2.18 - 3.81, p<0.0001) for all cause-mortality and 3.39 (95% CI 1.76 - 6.53, p<0.001) for CLRD mortality, compared with Q1 RAR. Restricted cubic splines analysis indicated a dose-response between RAR and risk of all-cause and CLRD mortality (p for non-linearity<0.001). Conclusion RAR had an independent association with all-cause mortality, especially CLRD mortality, in COPD patients. RAR has potential as a novel and promising predictor to identify COPD individuals with high mortality risk. © 2025 Zhang et al.

Wu R.; Zhang H.; Wang Y.; Mo Y.; Hu H.; Chen J.; Huang W.; Shi Q.; Kang Y.; Luo J.,A new stage for predicting the prognosis of granulomatous lobular mastitis,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0319956,"Introduction The prognosis of granulomatous lobular mastitis (GLM) had been poor, primarily due to the lack of a unified disease assessment standard. Objective The purpose of this cohort study was to establish a staging system for GLM to more accurately evaluate the prognosis of patients. Methods This study retrospectively collected data from 264 GLM patients who visited our hospital between January 2017 and December 2023. Through logistic regression analysis, factors associated with prognosis were identified, which served as the basis for creating a new staging system. Results Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that hyperlipidemia (HR: 2.031; 95% CI: 1.100-3.750) and microabscesses (HR: 2.087; 95% CI = 1.138-3.827) were significant independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of GLM patients. Based on the results of logistic analysis, three different stages were ultimately established, and it was found that stage C had the highest AUC value (AUC: 0.642), followed by stage B (AUC: 0.628), with stage A (AUC: 0.614) having the lowest. The Delong test revealed no significant difference in AUC values between stage A and stage B (P = 0.255), nor between stage B and stage C (P = 0.263). However, the AUC value of the stage C was found to be higher than that of stage A (P < 0.001). Given that stage C has the highest AUC value, this study selected stage C as the final stage for evaluating the prognosis of GLM patients and named it the 1st edition of GLM stage. Conclusions This study constructed a rigorous and widely applicable GLM staging system (the 1st edition of GLM stage). The system demonstrated good predictive outcomes and provided strong support for clinical decision-making.  © 2025 Wu et al.

Erlandsson Speychal F.; Pettersson M.; Eriksson M.; Odlind A.; Ohlin A.,"Transcutaneous bilirubin in newborns before, during, and after home phototherapy—Results from a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial",2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0320067,"Home phototherapy is recommended as an alternative to hospital-based therapy for neonatal jaundice in otherwise healthy full-term infants. With a reliable device for transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurement, bilirubin values could be monitored at home during treatment. This study aimed to examine the accuracy of TcB measurement of bilirubin levels before, during, and after home phototherapy. Patients requiring phototherapy were assigned to home (intervention) or hospital-based phototherapy (control). Transcutaneous bilirubin measurement was made at the sternum (uncovered skin) and at sacrum (covered by the diaper during treatment). Simultaneously, total serum bilirubin (TSB) level was collected through a blood sample. The agreement between TcB and TSB before, during, and after phototherapy was assessed using Bland-Altman plots. Altogether 141 patients and 856 paired bilirubin values were included. The results show that TcB measurements underestimate TSB levels. Before phototherapy, the mean difference between TcB and TSB was 75 ± 36 μmol/L at the sternum and 135 ± 39 μmol/L at sacrum, with no difference between study groups. During phototherapy, the mean difference at the sternum was larger in the control group, 105 ± 73 μmol/L, than in the intervention group, 50 ± 41 μmol/L; at sacrum, the mean difference was 125 ± 44 μmol/L, comparable in both study groups. After phototherapy, the TcB–TSB agreement improved, with a mean difference of 29 ± 33 μmol/L (sternum) and 87 ± 35 μmol/L (sacrum), and no difference between study groups. In conclusion this study shows that full-term infants who qualified for phototherapy show poor agreement between TcB measurement and TSB, suggesting that TcB measurements cannot replace measurement of TSB level before, during, or after home phototherapy. © 2025 Erlandsson Speychal et al.

In recent years, environmental enrichment, which is characterized by positive and comfortable eustress, has been shown to improve various physiological and pathological conditions. This study investigated the effects of environmental factors on energy metabolism in a menopause model using an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model. Wild-type female mice (8-week-old) were subjected to OVX or a sham operation and maintained under standard condition (SC), enriched environment (EE), or isolated (IS) condition for 4 weeks. OVX led to weight gain and disruption of circadian rhythms, along with changes in various metabolic parameters influenced by differences in housing environments; i.e., EE improved metabolic parameters, but IS deteriorated them. Physical activity and social interaction were factors that determined these differences. Menopause is usually a significant transitional period in a woman’s life, and changes in the social environment during this period can contribute to a diverse range of physical and psychological symptoms. Consequently, when implementing interventions to alleviate menopause-related pathological conditions, not only physical symptoms but also the social context should be carefully considered. © 2025 Ju et al.

Liu Q.; Wu X.; Wang Y.; Wang X.; Zhao F.; Shi J.,Association of dietary vitamin E intake with peripheral arterial disease: A retrospective cross-sectional study,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0320356,"Background The relationship between the amount of dietary vitamin E consumed and the development of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) remains a topic of debate. This relationship is of the utmost importance in the realms of healthcare and public health and is currently a highly researched and prominent topic. This study aimed to present the relationship between dietary vitamin E intake and PAD. Methods In a retrospective cross-sectional analysis, data from 6,588 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of the United States were examined during the period 1999–2004. We collected data on age, sex, race, marital status, education, physical activity, income, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, body mass index, total cholesterol and HbA1c. Logistic regression and smooth curve fitting were used to support the research objectives. Results After accounting for all relevant factors, a negative correlation between dietary vitamin E intake and the likelihood of PAD was observed (OR: 0.981, 95% CI: 0.957–1.004). The overall prevalence of PAD was 5.9%, with 49.6% in males and 50.4% in females. Individuals in the third quartile of dietary vitamin E intake had a lower occurrence rate of peripheral artery disease than those in the first quartile (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.91). Similar patterns of association were observed in the subgroup analysis (all P values for interaction were > 0.05). Conclusions Our study suggests a negative association between dietary vitamin E intake and incidence of PAD. Therefore individuals with insufficient dietary vitamin E intake, especially those with a very low intake, should consider increasing their vitamin E intake to lower the risk of developing PAD. These findings should be considered when offering dietary guidance and nutrition education to prevent PAD. © 2025 Liu et al.

Our retrospective study included 199 patients who underwent 3 T-liver MRIs with FB-DL-DWI and FB-C-DWI. DWI was performed using a single-shot, spin-echo, echo-planar, fat suppression technique during free-breathing with matching parameters. Three radiologists independently evaluated subjective image quality across two sequences. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured in 15 liver regions. Four radiologists analyzed 138 solid FLLs from 60 patients for the presence of diffusion restriction, lesion conspicuity, and sharpness. Among the 199 patients, 110 (55.3%) had underlying chronic liver disease (CLD). FB-DL-DWI was found to be 43.0% faster than FB-C-DWI (119.4±2.2sec vs. 209.6±3.7sec). Furthermore, FB-DL-DWI scored higher than FB-C-DWI for all subjective image quality parameters (all, P<0.001); however, FB-DL-DWI exhibited greater artificial sensation than FB-C-DWI (P<0.001). In patients with CLD, FB-DL-DWI exhibited a better subjective image quality (all, P<0.001) than FB-C-DWI. ADC values ranged from 1.06–1.12×10-3 mm2/sec in FB-DL-DWI and 1.06–1.20×10-3 mm2/sec in FB-C-DWI. Among the 138 lesions analyzed, 116 malignancies (61 hepatocellular carcinomas, 3 cholangiocarcinomas, 52 metastases) and 22 benignities were included. Four readers identified 88, 93, 93, and 105 diffusion-restricted FLLs in FB-DL-DWI and 84, 80, 98, and 95 in FB-C-DWI. FB-DL-DWI (75.9–90.5%) demonstrated comparable or superior diffusion restriction rates for malignant FLLs compared to FB-C-DWI (68.1–82.8%). Furthermore, FB-DL-DWI presented higher lesion-edge sharpness and lesion-conspicuity compared to FB-C-DWI. Overall, FB-DL-DWI provided better image quality, lesion sharpness, and conspicuity for solid FLLs, with a shorter acquisition time than FB-C-DWI. Therefore, FB-DL-DWI may replace FB-C-DWI as the preferred imaging method for liver evaluations. © 2025 Yoon et al.

However, its cost-effectiveness in the treatment of TNBC within the US health care context remains to be determined. Methods A 5-year Markov model was developed using data from the TORCHLIGHT study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of toripalimab plus nab-paclitaxel as a first-line therapy for metastatic or recurrent TNBC in the US. The model incorporated efficacy and safety data, literature-derived costs and utilities, and calculated ICERs. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of variable uncertainties on the outcomes. Results Toripalimab combined with nab-P chemotherapy for TNBC patients resulted in an additional 2.68 life years (LYs) and 1.72 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with an ICER of $593,750 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the cost and survival utility of toripalimab significantly influence patient outcomes. At a $100,000/QALY WTP threshold, combination therapy was not cost-effective compared with nab-P alone. Conclusions Our analysis suggests that, from a US health care system perspective, toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy does not demonstrate a significant cost-effective advantage over nab-P chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with TNBC at a WTP threshold of $100,000/QALY and has a limited impact on US health care policy and clinical practice. © 2025 Chen et al.

Methods A cross-sectional, single-center study was conducted, retrospectively analyzing hematological parameters from 259 T2DM patients with CAS (T2DM-CAS) and 131 T2DM patients without CAS (T2DM-WCAS). Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaques (CAP) were measured using Doppler ultrasound. Results The UAR level in the T2DM-CAS group was significantly higher than that in the T2DMWCAS group (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that UAR is an independent risk factor for T2DM-CAS (P < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for UAR in predicting T2DM-CAS was 0.712, with a Youden index of 0.278. Conclusion High levels of UAR are closely associated with the occurrence of T2DM-CAS and may serve as a useful biomarker for predicting T2DM-CAS. © 2025 Yin et al.

Mohammed Y.E.; Assele D.D.; Amsalu S.T.; Tayachew Y.H.; Abuka T.; Weldecherkos M.; Haile A.; Demelash S.,Prevalence and associated factors of chronic kidney disease among adults receiving antiretroviral therapy at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0320787,"Background Antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves life expectancy in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is greater in people living with HIV (PLWH) than in the general population, and it is becoming a significant public health issue, increasing disease progression and complicating treatment. However, patients in Africa are not routinely screened due to resource constraints, which leads to a high CKD burden. Identifying the predisposing factors is the crux of mitigating the burden of CKD. We investigate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and associated factors among PLWH at the Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (HUCSH). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2 to September 3, 2022, at the HUCSH ART clinic, in Hawassa, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 338 PLWH through interview and medical record review. Renal function was assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the “Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration” (CKD-EPI) formula. Data were entered in Epidata version 3.01 and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with CKD among PLWH. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was reported to show the strength of the association. The goodness of fit of the model was checked by the Hosmer and Lemeshow test. The statistical significance of associations was declared at a p-value < 0.05. Results The study included 338 PLWH with a response rate of 96%. The mean (standard deviation (SD) age of the participants was 44.4 (± 10.9) years. The female-to-male ratio was 1:1.8. The prevalence of CKD was 7.7% [95% CI: 5–10.7%]. History of alcohol use [AOR: 5.4; 95%CI: 1.32, 21.7], having chronic medical illness [AOR: 5.3; 95%CI: 1.45, 19.1], late stage of HIV [AOR: 5.2; 95%CI: 1.1, 25.3], opportunistic infections [AOR: 5.4; 95%CI: 1.25, 23.4], and low baseline hemoglobin level [AOR: 7.9; 95%CI: 2.58, 24.4] were significantly associated with CKD. Conclusion The study found that CKD prevalence in PLWH was high. Factors associated with CKD include alcohol use, chronic medical illness, advanced WHO HIV stage, opportunistic infections, and low hemoglobin. Therefore, PLWH should be regularly screened for early diagnosis and management of CKD, and those with associated factors should be closely monitored. © 2025 Mohammed et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001852629,Cross-sectional study
Mathew A.V.; Han Y.; Konje V.C.; Guo Y.; Byun J.; George A.; Meza J.; Rajagopalan S.; Chen Y.E.; Gillespie B.; Saran R.; Pennathur S.,High density lipoprotein particle size and function associate with new cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0320803,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and patients with CKD have markedly higher CVD mortality compared to healthy controls. However, the relationship between specific lipoprotein profiles and new CV events in patients with advanced CKD and cardiovascular burden is unknown. We profiled the distribution of High density lipoprotein (HDL) size, particle concentration, and cholesterol and triglyceride content of the baseline plasma of 325 subjects with moderate CKD followed for 2.5 years using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We used Cox regression models controlled for various clinical factors to characterize the role of specific HDL profiles in predicting CV events in this high-risk population. The cholesterol uptake capacity of HDL from peripheral tissues- cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) and HDL oxidation were also quantified using standardized assays. Patients with new CV events demonstrated increased HDL size, large HDL particle numbers, and CEC. Increased HDL particle size [HR = 2.56, p = 0.002], large HDL particle numbers [HR = 1.41, p = 0.001], HDL-cholesterol levels [HR = 1.03, p = 0.008], and CEC [HR = 1.46, p = 0.03] associated with CV events. Our study demonstrates that higher HDL particle size associated with new CV events in the CKD population with a high cardiovascular burden independent of CEC and HDL cholesterol. Collectively, the data strongly associate altered lipoprotein metabolism, particularly HDL metabolism, and new CV events in patients with established CKD and CVD, allowing us to risk stratify and potentially reduce mortality and morbidity in this high-risk population. © 2025 Mathew et al.

Luo J.; Zhou S.; Ding N.,Serum phosphate and 28-day mortality in adult sepsis with E.Coli infection: A critical care database study,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0321063,"Objective In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between serum phosphate and clinical outcomes in sepsis with E.Coli infection based on a public database in order to help physicians do individualized medical decisions. Methods We performed this retrospective study based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database (https://mimic.mit.edu/iv/). All the patients were hospitalized and serum phosphate was measured in 24 hours after hospitalization. E.Coli infection was confirmed by the positive blood culture of E.Coli in the database. Three models were utilized to investigate the relationship between serum phosphate and mortality in sepsis as follows: crude model (adjusted for none), model I (adjusted for age and gender) and model II (adjusted for all potential confounders). The smooth fitting curve was performed by the generalized additive model. Results 421 adult sepsis patients with E.Coli infection were included. The 28-day mortality was 10.69%(n=45). The median age was 70 and the proportion of males was 47.51%(n=200). The smooth fitting curve showed that the relationship between serum phosphate and 28-day mortality in sepsis with E.Coli infection was positive. When serum phosphate >2.1mg/dl, the relationship was significantly positive (OR=1.55, 95%CI:1.01–2.36, P=0.043). Conclusion The positive relationship between serum phosphate and 28-day mortality in adult sepsis patients with E.Coli infection was found based on MIMIC-IV database. © 2025 Luo et al.

Yin Z.; Zhu Z.; Wang C.; Jia X.; Zou X.,Comparison of the surgical efficacy of total hip replacement versus hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients with sarcopenia,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0321070,"Background Total hip arthroplasty (THA) and hemiarthroplasty (HA) are common surgical procedures for femoral neck fracture (FNF) in elderly patients; however, optimal treatment options remain controversial. Currently, limited research has compared the effectiveness of THA versus HA, specifically in patients with FNF and sarcopenia. Methods This retrospective study included data from 109 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the period between January 2015 and December 2017. Among these, 48 underwent THA, and 61 underwent hip arthroplasty (HA). The cross-sectional area (cm2) of muscle tissue at the pedicle level of the 12th thoracic vertebra (T12) was measured using chest computed tomography. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated by dividing the cross-sectional area of the muscle at the T12 pedicle by height squared. Sarcopenia was diagnosed when grip strength and SMI values were below the diagnostic cut-off value. Various factors were compared, including age, sex, SMI, body mass index (BMI), perioperative surgery-related indicators, postoperative 5-year survival, satisfaction, complication, and re-revision surgery rates between the 2 groups. Results There were no statistically significant differences between the THA and HA groups in terms of age (P = 0.227), sex (P = 0.870), SMI (P = 0.946), BMI (P = 0.310), postoperative time to ambulation (P = 0.803), length of hospitalization (P = 0.777), postoperative visual analog scale score (P = 0.933), and postoperative Harris score (P = 0.379). At the 5-year follow-up, there were no statistical differences in patient survival rate (P = 0.896), satisfaction (P = 0.945), incidence of complications (P = 0.796), or re-revision rate (P = 0.807). Patients who underwent THA had significantly longer operative times (P = 0.000) and larger surgical incisions (P = 0.000). They also experienced greater blood loss (P = 0.000) and blood transfusion volumes (P = 0.017), as well as increased hemoglobin (P = 0.000) and albumin (P = 0.000) loss. Furthermore, patients who underwent THA incurred higher surgical costs (P = 0.000). Conclusion THA and HA demonstrated comparable effectiveness and outcomes in patients with FNF and sarcopenia. HA was a less invasive and more cost-effective surgical option, making it the preferred choice. Copyright: © 2025 Yin et al.

Krischek J.-O.; Mannherz H.G.; Napirei M.,Different results despite high homology: Comparative expression of human and murine DNase1 in Pichia pastoris,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0321094,"The prolonged persistence of extracellular chromatin and DNA is a salient feature of diseases like cystic fibrosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and COVID-19 associated microangiopathy. Since deoxyribonuclease I (DNase1) is a major endonuclease involved in DNA-related waste disposal, recombinant DNase1 is an important therapeutic biologic. Recently we described the production of recombinant murine DNase1 (rmDNase1) in Pichia pastoris by employing the α-mating factor prepro signal peptide (αMF-SP) a method, which we now applied to express recombinant human DNASE1 (rhDNASE1). In addition to an impaired cleavage of the αMF pro-peptide, which we also detected previously for mDNase1, expression of hDNASE1 resulted in a 70–80 times lower yield although both orthologues share a high structural and functional homology. Using mDNase1 expression as a guideline, we were able to increase the yield of hDNASE1 fourfold by optimizing parameters like nutrients, cultivation temperature, methanol supply, and codon usage. In addition, post-translational import into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) was changed to co-translational import by employing the signal peptide (SP) of the α-subunit of the Oligosaccharyltransferase complex (Ost1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These improvements resulted in the purification of ~8mg pure mature rmDNase1 and ~0.4mg rhDNASE1 per Liter expression medium of a culture with a cell density of OD600 = 40 in 24 hours. As a main cause for the expression difference, we assume varying folding abilities to reach a native conformation, which induce an elevated unproductive unfolded protein response within the rER during hDNASE1 expression. Concerning functionality, rhDNASE1 expressed in P. pastoris is comparable to Pulmozyme®, i.e. rhDNASE1 produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by Roche - Genentech. With respect to the biochemical effectivity, rmDNase1 is superior to rhDNASE1 due to its higher specific activity in the presence of Ca2+/Mg2+ and the lower inhibition by monomeric actin. © 2025 Krischek et al.

Therefore, the research aims to bridge that gap by exploring the relationships between serum uric acid and depression, stratified by gender, in U.S. adults. In this study, the participants comprised individuals from five consecutive survey cycles (NHANES 2007–2008–2015–2016), with 20,804 qualified participants incorporated into the research. The assessment of depression was conducted utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and we calculated the weighted averages (95% CIs) for continuous variables and the percentages (95% CIs) for categorical variables among the chosen covariates. A multivariable logistic regression model with weights was utilized to assess the relationships between serum uric acid categories and depression status. In male subjects, uric acid levels may be linked inversely to depression. However, Tertile 3 (≥303.3 µmol/L) was more likely to develop depression than Tertile 1 (<249.8 µmol/L) among women. The study shows that high serum uric acid level may reduce the incidence of depression in men, but in females, it is an independent factor that increases the risk of depression. © 2025 Zhang et al.

Chepsiror C.; Veldman W.; Olotu F.; Tastan Bishop Ö.,Allosteric modulation of Plasmodium falciparum Isoleucyl tRNA synthetase by South African natural compounds,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0321444,"Targeting Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) aminoacyl tRNA synthetases is a viable strategy to overcome malaria parasite multi-drug resistance. Here, we focused on Pf Isoleucyl tRNA synthetase (PfIleRS) to identify potential allosteric inhibitors from 1019 South African Natural Compounds (SANC). Eleven potential hits, which passed ADMET and PAINS, were selected based on their docking binding affinity which was higher for PfIleRS than for human IleRS. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the compounds, particularly SANC456, commonly induced considerable changes in the global conformation and dynamics of PfIleRS, suggesting potential allosteric modulatory effects. Importantly, all 11 SANC hits reduced the binding affinity of the nucleotide AMP molecule by at least 25%. Some SANC ligand-bound systems (SANC456, SANC1095, and SANC1104) significantly increased the distance between the AMP and Ile ligands. Possible explanations for these changes were explored using three dynamic residue network centrality metrics. Betweenness centrality identified a major allosteric pathway in holo PfIleRS spanning the entire protein length. In contrast, SANC382, SANC456, SANC522, SANC806 and SANC1095 ligand-bound systems exhibited delta BC pathways (SANC-protein minus holo-protein), induced by the ligands, extending from their respective pockets into the active site. Additionally, eigenvector centrality revealed two important residue clusters either side of the holo active site which became altered in the ligand-bound systems, indicating possible allosteric activity. Lastly, many SANC systems showed decreased closeness centrality of zinc finger and active site residues, including the HYGH and KMSKR motifs. We believe that the compounds identified in this study as potential allosteric inhibitors have strong translational potential and warrant further investigation through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Overall, they hold promise as starting points for the development of new and effective antimalarial therapies, particularly against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium parasites. © 2025 Chepsiror et al.

The development of efficient therapies is still challenging. Propolis, with its antioxidant properties, shows potential in controlling the oxidative stress associated with the disease. The present study aimed to determine the chemical composition of ethanolic extract from propolis produced by Plebeia catamarcensis (EEP-Pc) and Tetragonisca fiebrigi (EEP-Tf), as well as their in vitro and in vivo antioxidant effects, lifespan influence and induced paralysis in Caenorhabditis elegans, mutant model for Alzheimer’s disease. The chemical profile of EEP-Pc and EEP-Tf was characterized through GC-MS and HPLC, identifying phenolic compounds and terpenes. In vitro antioxidant activity was observed using the DPPH• free radicals scavenging method and protection against proteins and DNA oxidation. In vivo, P. catamarcensis and T. fiebrigi propolis extracts showed no reproductive or locomotor toxicity and promoted resistance to oxidative stress in nematodes exposed to the oxidative agent Juglone. Both propolis extracts increased longevity and reduced the signs of paralysis caused by the accumulation of β-amyloid peptides, a marker for Alzheimer’s disease. Together, these data show that propolis from stingless bees P. catamarcensis and T. fiebrigi exhibits promising antioxidant activities against oxidative stress, indicating pharmacological potential with the capacity to reduce symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.

Hu Z.; Song C.; Zhang J.,Serum uric acid level as a prognostic biomarker in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: A retrospective single-center study,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0321576,"Background The predictive value of serum uric acid (SUA) for clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) remained unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of SUA in predicting all-cause mortality among critically ill patients diagnosed with SA-AKI. Methods This retrospective study examined 483 patients with SA-AKI at the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University from January 2015 to July 2023. The primary outcome evaluated in this study was in hospital all-cause mortality. To assess the prognostic value of SUA, we employed receiver operating characteristic curves, restricted cubic splines, Cox regression models, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results The hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality reached 43.3% and 42.2%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of 30-day mortality (log-rank test, P < 0.001) and 60-day mortality (log-rank test, P = 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with hyperuricemia (HUA). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that elevated SUA levels were significantly related to all-cause mortality. After accounting for potential confounding factors, patients with HUA maintained a significant correlation with both hospital mortality [HR (95%CI): 1.462 (1.094-1.952); P = 0.010] and ICU mortality [HR (95%CI): 1.474 (1.096-1.983); P = 0.010]. Further examination using restricted cubic splines revealed a progressively increasing risk of all-cause mortality with rising SUA levels. Conclusions Higher levels of SUA were associated with an increased risk of both hospital mortality and ICU mortality in critically ill patients with SA-AKI. These findings suggested that SUA may serve as an independent prognostic marker for these patients. © 2025 Hu et al.

Gao C.; Liu M.; Sun Y.; Zhao Z.; Wei F.; Xu X.,Association between advanced lung cancer inflammation index and gallstone prevalence among U.S. adults: A population-based study,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0321733,"Introduction Gallstones are a common digestive disorder, with a global prevalence of 10%–15%, posing a significant economic burden on public health. The formation of gallstones is closely associated with inflammation and nutritional status. The Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index (ALI) is a composite measure for assessing inflammation and nutritional status; however, its relationship with gallstone risk remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between ALI and gallstone prevalence among U.S. adults. Methods This study is based on data from the 2017–2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and includes 5,826 adults aged 20 years and older. The Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index (ALI) was calculated using body mass index (BMI), serum albumin levels, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The prevalence of gallstones was determined through questionnaire surveys. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to analyze the relationship between ALI and the risk of gallstones. Additionally, trend analysis, smooth curve fitting, and subgroup analyses were conducted. Results The study results showed a significant positive correlation between ALI levels and the risk of gallstone disease. After fully adjusting for covariates, each unit increase in lnALI was associated with a 42% increase in the risk of gallstone disease (OR =  1.42, 95% CI: 1.12–1.80). Trend analysis indicated a significant dose-response relationship between ALI and gallstone risk (P for trend <  0.01). Subgroup analysis further revealed that the correlation between ALI and gallstone risk was more pronounced in females, non-diabetic patients, individuals with higher education levels, those with insufficient physical activity, and non-drinkers, with gender showing a significant interaction effect (interaction P <  0.05). Smooth curve fitting further validated the linear relationship between ALI and gallstone risk, and this association was particularly prominent in the female population. Conclusions This study demonstrates that ALI is significantly associated with the risk of gallstones, particularly among women. As a simple and readily accessible indicator, ALI may help identify high-risk populations and provide a new clinical tool for the prevention and management of gallstones. Future longitudinal studies should further validate these findings and evaluate the predictive value of ALI across different populations. © 2025 Gao et al.

Huang Y.; Ao T.; Wang Y.; Zhen P.; Hu M.,The red blood cell distribution width is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0321789,"Background Identifying reliable prognostic indicators is essential for the appropriate management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has been established as an inflammatory marker associated with cardiovascular outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the association between RDW and both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in individuals with NAFLD. Methods Data from 7,438 participants with NAFLD were analyzed, collected between 2005 and 2016 through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Mortality data were retrieved from the National Death Index (NDI). Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was used to illustrate the relationship between RDW and mortality risk, Weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the independent relationship between RDW and mortality risk. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the predictive ability of RDW for survival outcomes. Results During a median follow-up period of 124 months, 1,269 deaths were recorded, including 335 from cardiovascular causes. RDW positively correlated with both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality according to the RCS analysis. Participants were categorized into quartiles based on RDW levels. Those in the highest RDW quartile (Q4) demonstrated a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR 3.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]:2.17–6.02, P=0.009) and all-cause mortality (HR 2.29, 95% CI:1.72–3.06, P < 0.0001), according to the weighted Cox hazards models. Additionally, the area under the curve (AUC) for all-cause mortality at 3, 5 and 10 years was, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.66, respectively. For cardiovascular mortality, the AUCs were 0.70, 0.68, and 0.68, respectively. Conclusion Among patients with NAFLD, RDW was identified as an independent predictor of increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk. © 2025 Huang et al.

Harting H.; Herrmann T.; Ehlert N.; Meißner J.; Angrisani N.; Reifenrath J.,Comparison of accumulation and distribution of PEGylated and CD-47-functionalized magnetic nanoporous silica nanoparticles in an in vivo mouse model of implant infection,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0321888,"Introduction Drug targeting using nanoparticles is a much-researched topic. Rapid interactions of nanoparticles with the host’s immune system and clearance from the circulation is a major problem resulting in non-satisfying accumulation rates in the desired region. The aim of the presented study was to compare organ distribution and implant accumulation of magnetic nanoporous silica nanoparticles (MNPSNP) functionalized with either Polyethylenglycol (PEG) or CD-47 in vivo in a mouse model of implant infection. Methods Synthesis and functionalization of the magnetic core-shell nanoparticles is described. In the in vivo study, 32 mice were included and received an in staphylococcus aureus solution preincubated magnetic implant subcutaneously on the left and a nonmagnetic implant on the right hind leg. MNPSNP accumulation in the inner organs as well as on and around the implants was analyzed in dependence on the functionalization. Results MNPSNP were successfully functionalized with PEG or CD-47. In vivo, unexpectedly both nanoparticle variants accumulated mainly in liver and spleen. In the tissue, surrounding the implants higher nanoparticle accumulation was seen in areas with more severe signs of inflammation Nanoparticles were detectable on both implant materials, but accumulation rate was very low. Conclusion Although various literature describes higher accumulation rates for nanoparticles functionalized with CD-47 in target areas and a reduced accumulation in liver and spleen, this could not be shown within this study. Possible instability or rapid agglomeration of the particles are conceivable reasons. Higher accumulation rates in areas with more severe signs of inflammation indicate that inflammatory cells might be essential for the delivery of nanoparticles into inflamed regions. © 2025 Harting et al.

The overlapping risk factors and symptoms between COVID-19 and mucormycosis further complicate prompt detection, which is crucial for patient survival. This study aims to investigate potential differences in mucormycosis progression, initial symptom presentation, and laboratory value alterations in mucormycosis patients with COVID-19 history to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve outcomes in this complex clinical scenario. Methodology This retrospective cohort study, conducted from April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022, examined 102 patients diagnosed with mucormycosis at two primary teaching hospitals. Patients were categorized into two groups based on COVID-19 history. Variables included demographic information, clinical parameters, laboratory results, and outcomes. The study compared patient laboratory studies and presentation symptoms between COVID-19 history-positive and COVID-19 history-negative groups, with a particular focus on mortality rates and associated comorbidities such as diabetes, cancer and immunosuppressive treatment. Results Initial clinical presentations differed significantly, eneralized Estimating Equations (GEE) analysis, adjusted for comorbidities, revealed COVID-19 history was associated with increased platelet counts (P = 0.0311) and decreased facial swelling (P = 0.049) and fever symptom reporting (P < 0.001). Cancer history, diabetes, and immunosuppressive treatment also showed significant associations with various clinical and laboratory parameters. Laboratory analysis revealed significant differences between mucormycosis patients with and without COVID-19 history. The COVID-19 history-positive group showed lower WBC counts (P = 0.002), and higher hemoglobin levels (P < 0.001) compared to controls. Diabetes was more prevalent in COVID-19 history-positive patients, while cancer history was more common in controls. Conclusion This study reveals intricate relationships between COVID-19 history, mucormycosis, patient presentation, challenging earlier findings. Mucormycosis patients with COVID-19 history exhibited higher platelet counts and altered symptom presentation. The research highlights varied symptom patterns across patient subgroups and underscores the complexity of interactions between COVID-19, cancer, and diabetes in mucormycosis cases. These findings advocate multivariate analytical approaches to better understand these multifaceted relationships. © 2025 Hejazi et al.

This study aimed to investigate predictive factors of zinc deficiency in orthopaedic inpatients. A retrospective case-control study was conducted on patients admitted to Teikyo University Chiba Medical Center from 15 February to 31 August 2022. Patients were divided into zinc deficiency (< 60 µg/dL) and non-deficiency groups. Data included demographics, comorbidities, hospitalisation reasons, fracture details, medication use, and laboratory values. Fisher’s exact test and two-sample t-tests were used for analysis. Of 156 patients, 47 (30.1%) had zinc deficiency. The case group had higher fracture rates (68.1% vs. 33.9%; p<0.001), and lower rates of spinal disease (2.1% vs. 31.2%; p<0.001) and osteoarthritis (8.5% vs. 22.9%; p=0.04). Fragility and hip fractures were more common in the case group. Anaemia, hip fracture, and hypoalbuminaemia were independent predictive factors of zinc deficiency. © 2025 Iida et al.

Furan (FU) is a small, heterocyclic compound present in the volatile fraction of various thermally processed foods and beverages. Rats were categorized into five groups, each comprising ten rats. Group 1 served as the control group, receiving corn oil. Group 2 received LSO (3 g/kg body weight orally) for 28 days. Rats in Group 3 (FU-exposed group) received an oral administration of FU at a dosage of 16 mg/kg body weight each day for 28 days. Rats in Group 4 (Therapeutic co-treated group) were administered both LSO and subsequent FU exposure according to the previously outlined dosage regimen for 28 days. Rats in Group 5 (Protective co-treated group) received LSO seed oil for 14 days as protection then received Fu at the same mentioned doses of Fu until the end of experiment. Rats administered FU and/or LSO gained noticeably more weight than the control group. LSO significantly decreased AST and LDH levels in both the protection and treatment groups as compared to the FU-only group. It also assisted in restoring testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels that were decreased by FU, especially in the protected group. LSO also reduced kidney damage markers and normalized biomarker levels when administered with FU. The LSO-only group demonstrated normal immune response markers, similar to the control group. By changing MDA levels and increasing SOD, GSH, and TAC levels, co-treatment with LSO enhanced liver health. The control and LSO groups displayed normal spleen structure, whereas the LSO/FU group had normal seminiferous tubules with mild edema and congestion. Overall, LSO demonstrated protective and therapeutic benefits against FU-induced damage in rats. © 2025 Zahran et al.

Elias T.P.; Shewaye A.B.; Fisseha H.; Nur A.M.; Berhane K.A.; Minyilshewa A.T.; Kumsa K.B.; Seid B.M.,Predictors of in-hospital mortality among cirrhotic patients in Ethiopia: A multicenter retrospective study,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0322532,"Background In Ethiopia, cirrhosis is the 6th leading cause of death and is responsible for high hospitalization and mortality rates. However, until now, factors affecting in-hospital mortality of patients with liver cirrhosis are poorly understood. This study assessed the predictors of in-hospital mortality among cirrhotic patients in Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study using data collected from the electronic medical records of patients who were admitted for complications of liver cirrhosis between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, in the medical wards of Adera Medical Center, St. Paul’s Hospital Millennium Medical College, and Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. Frequency and cross-tabulation were used for descriptive statistics. Predictor variables with a p-value <0.25 in bivariate analyses were included in the logistic regression. Results Of the 299 patients included in the final analysis, the majority (79.6%) were males, and the median age of the study participants was 45 (IQR, 36–56) years. Hepatitis B virus (32.1%) was the most common etiology, followed by alcohol (30.1%) and hepatitis C virus (13.4%). Ascites (69.2%), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (50.5%), and hepatic encephalopathy (44.8%) were the most common forms of presentation. The in-hospital mortality rate was 25.4%. West Haven grade III or IV hepatic encephalopathy (AOR: 12.0; 95% CI 2.33–61.63; P<0.01), hepatocellular carcinoma (AOR: 9.05; 95% CI 2.18–37.14; P: 0.01), history of previous admission within one year period (AOR: 6.80; 95% CI 2.18–21.18; P<0.01), acute kidney injury (AOR: 6.47; 95% CI 1.77–23.64; P<0.01), and model for end-stage liver disease – sodium score (AOR: 1.17; 95% CI 1.05–1.30; P: 0.02), were found to be predictors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion In-hospital mortality of cirrhotic patients is high in Ethiopia. West Haven grade III or IV hepatic encephalopathy is the leading cause of mortality. Hence, prompt identification and management of hepatic encephalopathy and its precipitant at an earlier stage is crucial for better treatment outcomes and survival. © 2025 Elias et al.

Zheng P.; Wang X.; Ni J.,Relationship between the systemic immune-inflammatory index and overactive bladder risk: A cross-sectional assessment involving United States Adults,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0323052,"Aims This study aimed to evaluate the association between the systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII) and the risk of overactive bladder (OAB) in the adult United States population. Methods Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2010 were analyzed. A non-pregnant cohort aged ≥20 years with available SII and OAB data was included. Weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between SII and OAB risk. Additionally, subgroup, interaction, and restricted cubic spline analyses were conducted. Results A total of 4,545 participants were included, of whom 16.13% had OAB, with a mean SII of 5.75 ± 0.07. OAB risk increased with higher SII tertiles. In the fully adjusted model (Model 2), individuals in the highest SII tertile exhibited a 41% higher risk of OAB compared to those in the lowest tertile (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.13–1.76, P = 0.004). Two-piece-wise regression analysis identified an SII breakpoint at 3.40, where a significant positive association was found for SII ≥ 3.40 (OR = 1.06, P < 0.0001), whereas no significant association was detected for SII < 3.40 (P = 0.06). Subgroup and interaction analyses revealed a consistent relationship between SII and OAB across different population strata, except for diabetes mellitus. Conclusion SII, an easily accessible biomarker, was independently associated with an increased risk of OAB, highlighting its potential utility in diagnostic prediction. © 2025 Zheng et al.

Despite their effectiveness, surgical options such as hysterectomy are invasive, costly, and associated with recurrences. Pharmacological treatments are non-curative, only alleviate symptoms, and associated with adverse effects. Polyscias fulva (Araliaceae) is traditionally used to manage uterine fibroids in East Africa. In this study we synthesized Polyscias fulva silver nanoparticles (PFAgNPs), evaluated their toxicity and activity against monosodium glutamate (MSG)-induced uterine fibroids in Wistar albino rats. The UV-visible spectroscopy showed maximal absorbance at 425 nm with adequate stability at varying temperatures, pH and storage conditions. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis revealed an average hydrodynamic size of 107.4 d.nm, polydispersity index of 0.264, and zeta potential of -18.3 mV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the crystalline nature of PFAgNPs with an average size of 25 nm while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed a spherical shape with an average size of 35 nm. The PFAgNPs caused lethargy, hyperventilation, and hyperactivity at a dose of 300 mg/kg BW, whereas 2000 mg/kg caused severe toxicity, resulting in death in acute toxicity testing. The no observed adverse effect level was 50 mg/kgBW, the lowest observed adverse effect level was 100 mg/kgBW, and median lethal dose (LD50) was 1000 mg/kg. The PFAgNPs significantly decreased (P < 0.05) serum proteins, cholesterol, estrogen and progesterone alongside preservation of the histoarchitecture of the uterus. Further research is needed to investigate the clinical safety of PFAgNPs in managing uterine fibroids. © 2025 Kiyimba et al.

Yang J.; Liujiao Y.; Zhang X.; Xiong J.; Wang F.; Shen F.,High NE dose trajectory is associated with new onset of acute kidney injury patients: A group-based trajectory modeling analysis,2025,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0323431,"Background Norepinephrine (NE) is a first line and effective vasopressor for septic shock management, but its impact on newonset acute kidney injury (AKI) in those patients remains controversial. This study sought to investigate the relationship between norepinephrine dose trajectories and the new occurrence of AKI during the management of septic shock by using NE. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the MIMIC-IV database, which includes 3,462 patients diagnosed with septic shock during the initial 96 hours following their admission to the ICU. The unique patterns of trajectory analysis of NE were characterized by using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) during the initial four days of ICU admission. We employed multivariable logistic regression analysis and subgroup analysis to evaluate the association between NE dose trajectories and new-onset AKI in patients with septic shock. Results Three NE dose trajectories were identified: low NE dose (47.3%), middle NE dose (41.5%), and high NE dose (11.2%). The high NE dose trajectory had significantly higher risks for new onset of AKI (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.43–3.99), MAKE-30 (OR 3.82, 95% CI 2.97–4.91), and for 28-day mortality (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.70–2.37) compared to the low NE dose trajectory. Despite over 90% of patients in the middle NE dose trajectory developing AKI, patients in this trajectory exhibited a lower risk of MAKE-30 and 28-day mortality. After comprehensive adjustment for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, acute physiological status, laboratory indicators, and fluid management, high NE dose trajectory remained independently associated with increased risk of new-onset AKI (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.04–1.86, P=0.024), this association persisted across multiple subgroup analyses. Conclusion During the management of septic shock, high dose of NE trajectory was associated with high likelihood of new onset of AKI, high possibility of MAKE-30 and high 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock. High NE dose trajectory serves as an independent predictor for assessing the risk of new-onset AKI in patients with septic shock. © 2025 Yang et al.

Acute liver failure was induced by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine (D-GalN, 600 mg/kg) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 µg/kg), common bile duct ligation surgery, and removing 70% of the liver mass. The fourth group served as the control without intervention. The time-activity curves for the liver and heart were generated from dynamic SPECT scans with 99mTc-ethylene hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (EHIDA). Image-derived functional parameters (5-minute heart/liver index [HLI5] and 15-minute receptor index [LHL15]) were calculated. Furthermore, correlations of image-derived parameters with serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, liver aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, and liver mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and chemokine ligand-10 (CXCL-10) were analyzed.Results All animals in the experimental groups exhibited varying degrees of liver damage. The SPECT images and indexes (HLI5 and LHL15) of the experimental groups significantly differed from those of the control group (P < 0.05). In the experimental groups, serum IL-6 levels and liver mRNA levels of TNF-α and CXCL-10 were significantly higher, while liver AST and ALT levels were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05).Conclusion Using SPECT with 99mTc-EHIDA, along with the calculated indexes and levels of various cytokines, presents a dependable method for assessing liver function. © 2025 Xie et al.

Methods We searched for publications related to kidney/renal donors, arterial stiffness, blood pressure, and cardiovascular risk, and included every study employing those terms. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Twelve studies and 2059 individuals, with a mean age of 46.53 ± 11.27 years, were included in the analysis. Male donors constituted 40.6% of the participants, and the mean follow-up was 2.62 ± 3.2 years. Eleven studies indicated that systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure remained stable within the first year after nephrectomy. However, as the follow-up period extended, especially beyond one year, both were increased (median difference (MD) of SBP was 2.09 [0.06, 4.12] over the first year and 7.7 [6.96, 8.44] over the 5 years of follow-up). Regarding PWV and AIx, assessed in 6 studies, no fluctuations were observed post-donation (MD of PWV was 0.1620 [−0.0423; 0.3662], and MD of AIx was 8.2265 [3.6450; 12.8080]). In addition, 11 studies revealed a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after nephrectomy (MD −27.4960, p-value < 0.0001), though no albuminuria was observed. Lastly, BMI demonstrated negligible changes throughout the follow-up. Conclusion Kidney donation is a relatively safe procedure, and despite the observed decline in eGFR, it does not per se impose further cardiovascular burden on the donors. However, the heterogeneity and the lack of data underscores the need for high-quality studies so as to elucidate the connection between arterial stiffness, blood pressure, and GFR level. © 2025 Smyrli et al.

Data from conventional registries describing trajectories are partial. The aim was to provide a complete description of the peritoneal dialysis pathway. Methods Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis in France between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2019, were included. Data from the national REIN (Renal Epidemiology and Information Network) registry and the SNDS (Administrative Database of Outpatient and Inpatient Care Consumption) database were used. Patient trajectories and status (peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, mixed and hybrid dialysis, kidney transplantation, and death) were reconstructed. Each dialysis session, even a single day, was recorded. The trajectory was described using a Sankey diagram. Results A total of 5,053 patients in the REIN registry and the SNDS database underwent peritoneal dialysis at some point. The Sankey diagram showed the great diversity and complexity of care pathways. Only 1,652 (33%) of patients underwent peritoneal dialysis only. A total of 1,807 (36%) patients changed kidney replacement therapy 2 times or more. There was high permeability between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis: 1,358 (27%) patients transferred from hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis and 2,018 (40%) transferred from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis. A total of 251 (5%) patients underwent hybrid dialysis. A total of 498 (10%) patients experienced an unstable period of mixed dialysis and managed to return to peritoneal dialysis for a significant time (median of 339 days). The causes of transfers were not available. Conclusion Our results describe a more precise view of the trajectories of peritoneal dialysis patients compared to data from conventional registries. Peritoneal dialysis is a component of a multimodal pathway, as two thirds are likely to receive another kidney replacement therapies. Ongoing information about other kidney replacement therapies regimens seems necessary for peritoneal dialysis patients. The organization of each dialysis center must integrate and facilitate these transfers. © 2025 Legendre et al.

Feng Y.; Yu L.; Wang J.,Association of 25(OH)D serum level with biological aging: A Cross-Sectional Study of 2007–2016 NHANES surveys,2025,PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0328107,"Vitamin D plays a crucial role in various aspects of human body, including aging, but chronological age may not accurately reflect the true biological aging status. Recently, PhenoAge has been developed to estimate an individual’s biological age based on different biological and clinical measures. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between 25(OH)D serum levels and biological aging calculated by PhenoAge Acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) using data from the 2007−2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 25(OH)D serum levels were negatively associated with PhenoAgeAccel (β = −0.04 standard deviation [SD]; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.08 to 0.00). This negative association was dose-dependent in females (β = −0.07 SD; 95% CI: −0.12 to 0.01), but not in males. Generalized additive models further revealed gender-specific non-linear patterns: a U-shape pattern in males but an L-shaped pattern in females. Using segmented regression to confirm inflection points, we observed that 25(OH)D serum levels were linked to reduced PhenoAgeAccel at levels below 38.2 nmol/L (15.3 ng/mL) in males (β = −0.013 SD; 95% CI: −0.025 to −0.002) and 62.5 nmol/L (25.0 ng/mL) in females (β = −0.007 SD; 95% CI: −0.01 to −0.004,). However, 25(OH)D serum levels above 125 nmol/L showed no association with PhenoAgeAccel in females (β = −0.001 SD; 95% CI: −0.005–0.002), while in males, elevated levels (>91.6 nmol/L) were associated with increased PhenoAgeAccel (β = 0.005 SD; 95% CI: 0.002–0.008). Our findings indicate that vitamin D insufficiency has an inverse link with accelerated biological aging, and high levels of vitamin D in males accelerated biological aging as well, offering valuable insights into the relationship between vitamin D and biological aging.

Methods A cross-sectional analysis of NHANES data was conducted, examining the relationship between dietary anthocyanidins intake and frailty risk. Dose-response relationships and subgroup analyses were performed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the associations. Results The results indicate a significant inverse relationship between the consumption of specific anthocyanidin types, including malvidin and delphinidin, as well as total anthocyanidins, and the odds of frailty. Particularly, individuals aged 41–60 years and males exhibited a notable protective effect of anthocyanidins against frailty. Dose-response analyses revealed a U-shaped relationship between total anthocyanidins intake and frailty risk, with an optimal consumption level of 33.322 mg per day. Conclusion This pioneering study emphasizes the potential protective role of dietary anthocyanidins in mitigating frailty, especially among middle-aged individuals and males. © 2025 Zhang et al.

Han Y.-N.; Xiong C.-Y.; Wang Y.-X.; Yuan J.-L.; Li L.; Xiao Z.-X.,Association between serum anion gap and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with diabetic kidney disease: Analysis of the MIMIC-IV database,2025,PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0329269,"Background Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most common diabetic complications and is closely related to metabolic acidosis. The serum anion gap (AG), an important index of acid-base balance, may reflect disturbed metabolism and be correlated with increased mortality risk. However, the role of AG in all-cause mortality risk in individuals suffering from severe DKD is not yet clear. Methods In this study, patients identified with a diagnosis of severe DKD utilizing MIMIC-IV database were determined. They were subsequently divided into four quartiles based on their serum AG levels. The findings consisted of in-hospital deaths and ICU deaths. The relationship between serum AG levels of severe DKD patients and clinical outcomes was elucidated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and RCS analysis. Results In total, 1,716 patients (66.43% male) received treatment, with in-hospital and ICU mortality rates reaching 16.43% and 13.17%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that elevated serum AG levels were remarkably linked to all-cause mortalities. When adjusted for confounders, elevated serum AG levels correlated notably with in-hospital mortality [HR = 1.09(95%CI:1.07,1.11)P < 0.0001] and ICU mortality [HR = 1.10(95%CI:1.07,1.12)P < 0.0001]. RCS analysis showed that serum AG levels were positively correlated in a linear fashion with all-cause death risk. Conclusion Serum AG shows a significant positive correlation with all-cause mortalities in hospitals and ICU settings among patients with severe DKD. This suggests that serum AG could serve as a potential indication for recognizing DKD individuals with an increased overall risk of all-cause death. © 2025 Han et al.

This research seeks to evaluate the prognostic value of the lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) in predicting short-term outcomes for children diagnosed with AKI. A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Pediatric Intensive Care database, covering the period from 2010 to 2018. The relationship between the LAR and in-hospital mortality was explored using smoothing curve fitting, multivariate logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive capability of LAR for in-hospital mortality. A total of 631 pediatric patients with AKI were included in this study. Smoothing curve fitting revealed a nearly linear positive association between the LAR and in-hospital mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified LAR as an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.85–3.59). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with a higher LAR had a significantly greater 30-day mortality rate compared to those with lower LAR values. ROC curve analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.85 (95% CI 0.80–0.90). At the optimal cutoff value of 0.80, the sensitivity was 80.42%, specificity was 77.97%, and accuracy was 80.19%. These results suggest that LAR is a promising prognostic indicator of mortality in pediatric patients with AKI, and could serve as an early indicator of risk stratification. © 2025 Zhang et al.

Oxidative balance score (OBS) could assess the antioxidant capacity of an individual’s body. The purpose of this study sought to investigate the connection between OBS and the recently proposed inflammatory indicator——Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII). Methods The study incorporated 16,080 participants from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2003–2018). We utilized weight multivariable linear regression analyses to assess this association. Additionally, subgroup analyses and linear relationships were performed for deeper insights. The robustness of the findings was ensured by conducting multiple sensitivity analyses. Results In the multivariate model using the first OBS category as the reference, higher OBS quartiles had a significantly negative association with SII [β=−51.52 (95%CI: −68.31, −34.73), P for trend<0.001]. The interaction test showed that age (P<0.001) and hypertension (P=0.043) had a significant effect on this connection. Restricted cubic splines plot with four knots illustrated a linear relationship between OBS and SII (Pnon-liner=0.677). The findings from the sensitivity analysis aligned with the outcomes of the primary analysis, confirming the consistency and reliability of the results. Conclusions OBS based on diet and lifestyle had a strongly negative association with SII. This study emphasized the importance of improving an individual’s overall antioxidant status through diet and lifestyle changes, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing inflammation index. © 2025 Niu et al.

To examine immunologic responses that may drive varying outcomes in influenza, we infected C57BL/6 (B6) and A/J mice with mouse-adapted influenza A virus A/PR/8/34 H1N1. A self-resolving dose in B6 mice was lethal in A/J mice, which had increased viral load throughout infection accompanied by prominent bronchoalveolar neutrophilia and pulmonary vascular leakage preceding mortality. Notably, the B6 mice heavily recruited neutrophils to lungs early in infection while A/J mice failed to do so. Neutrophils from A/J mice additionally displayed reduced neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation compared to B6 mice early in infection, suggesting the failure to control virus in A/J mice was a product of deficient neutrophil response. To determine if variation in neutrophils between strains governed viral control and inflammation, we adoptively transferred bone marrow neutrophils from B6 or A/J donors to A/J recipients early in infection and found that the transfer of B6 neutrophils enhanced viral clearance and abrogated the dissemination of CXCL1 and IL-6. The transfer of A/J neutrophils, however, failed to achieve either. Furthermore, B6 neutrophils were capable of greater levels of viral killing in vitro than their A/J counterparts. These results suggest that a key moderator of inflammation in influenza infection is the control of virus by neutrophils early in infection. Thus, host-specific differences in both the recruitment of these cells as well as interindividual variation in neutrophil ability to support viral clearance may in part dictate differing susceptibility to respiratory viral infections.

Shen Z.; Li C.; Song W.; Liu L.; Kong Y.; Huang A.; Bao Q.; Ying T.; Wu Y.,Enhancing vaccine half-life as a novel strategy for improving immune response durability of subunit vaccines,2025,PLoS Pathogens,10.1371/journal.ppat.1012845,"Vaccines are widely regarded as one of the most effective strategies for combating infectious diseases. However, significant challenges remain, such as insufficient antibody levels, limited protection against rapidly evolving variants, and poor immune durability, particularly in subunit vaccines, likely due to their short in vivo exposure. Recent advances in extending the half-life of protein therapeutics have shown promise in improving drug efficacy, yet whether increasing in vivo persistence can enhance the efficacy of subunit vaccines remains underexplored. In this study, we developed two trimeric SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines with distinct pharmacokinetic profiles to evaluate the impact of vaccine persistence on immune efficacy. A self-assembling trimeric subunit vaccine (RBD-HR/trimer) was designed, followed by an extended-persistence variant (RBD-sFc-HR/trimer) incorporating a soluble monomeric IgG1 fragment crystallizable. We demonstrated that RBD-sFc-HR/trimer elicited more robust and higher levels of neutralizing antibodies, with potent and broad neutralization activity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably, RBD-sFc-HR/trimer induced a durable immune response, significantly increasing the number of memory B cells and T cells. This study provides critical insights for designing vaccines that achieve potent and long-lasting immune responses against infectious diseases. © 2025 Shen et al.

Strong inflammatory responses and vascular leakage are important hallmarks of these often fatal diseases. The mechanism behind pathogenesis is unknown and no specific treatment is available. IL-6 was recently highlighted as a biomarker for HPS/HFRS severity. IL-6 signaling is complex and context dependent: while classical signaling generally provide protective responses, trans-signaling can cause severe pathogenic responses. Here, we investigated a potential role for IL-6 trans-signaling in hantavirus pathogenesis. Methods Effects of IL-6 trans-signaling during in vitro hantavirus infection were assessed using primary human endothelial cells treated with recombinant soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Plasma from Puumala orthohantavirus-infected HFRS patients (n=28) were analyzed for IL-6 trans-signaling potential and its associations to severity. Findings In vitro, sIL-6R treatment of infected cells enhanced IL-6 and CCL2 secretion, upregulated ICAM-1, and affected VE-cadherin leading to a disrupted cell barrier integrity. HFRS patients showed altered plasma levels of sIL-6R and soluble gp130 (sgp130) resulting in an increased sIL-6R/sgp130 ratio suggesting enhanced IL-6 trans-signaling potential. Plasma sgp130 levels negatively correlated with number of interventions and positively with albumin levels. Patients receiving oxygen treatment displayed a higher sIL-6R/sgp130 ratio compared to patients that did not. Interpretation IL-6 trans-signaling is linked to hantavirus pathogenesis. Targeting IL-6 trans-signaling might provide a therapeutic strategy for treatment of severe HFRS and perhaps also HPS. © 2025 Maleki et al.

Canadian Medical Association Journal,10.1503/cmaj.240922,"Background: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD), sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve renal outcomes, but may transiently affect biochemical markers of CKD–mineral and bone disorders (CKDMBD). We sought to evaluate the longterm risk of CKDMBD associated with use of SGLT2 inhibitors in this patient population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, employing a target trial emulation framework and using electronic medical records of patients from 9 hospitals in Taiwan (2016–2023). We included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1–3 CKD who had newly started either an SGLT2 inhibitor or, as a comparison group, a glucagonlike peptide1 receptor agonist (GLP1 RA). The primary outcome was a composite of incident biochemical abnormalities (serum phosphate > 1.5 mmol/L, serum calcium < 2.1 mmol/L, serum intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] > 6.9 pmol/L, or serum 25hydroxyvitamin D < 49.9 nmol/L). R e s u l t s: T h e c o h o r t i n c l u d e d 13 379 patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 11 920) or GLP1 RAs (n = 1459) with a median followup of 3.3 years. Compared with GLP1 RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a lower cumulative incidence of the composite primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–0.86), hyperphosphatemia (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76–0.91), hypocalcemia (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.78–0.86), high serum iPTH levels (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.57–0.78), and low serum 25hydroxyvitamin D levels (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47–0.90). Interpretation: Use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a lower incidence of biochemical abnormalities related to CKDMBD than GLP1 RAs. These agents may be considered to reduce risk of CKDMBD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1–3 CKD. © 2025 CMA Impact Inc.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219415198,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
Nakada S.; Welsh P.; Celis-Morales C.; Pell J.P.; Ho F.K.,Refining PREVENT prediction models for 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease using measures of anxiety and depression,2025,CMAJ. Canadian Medical Association Journal,10.1503/cmaj.240996,"Background: Anxiety and depression are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to investigate whether adding measures of anxiety and depression to the American Heart Association Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events (PREVENT) predictors improves the prediction of CVD risk. Methods: We developed and internally validated risk prediction models using 60% and 40% of the cohort data from the UK Biobank, respectively. Mental health predictors included baseline depressive symptom score and self-reported and record-based history of anxiety and depression diagnoses before the baseline. We identified CVD events using hospital admission and death certificate data over a 10-year period from baseline. We determined incremental predictive values by adding the mental health predictors to the PREVENT predictors using Harrell's C-indices, sensitivity, specificity, and net reclassification improvement indices. We used a threshold of 10-year risk of incident CVD of greater than 5%. Results: Of the 502 366 UK Biobank participants, we included 195 489 in the derivation set and 130 326 in the validation set. In the validation set, the inclusion of all mental health measures, except selfreported anxiety, produced a very modest increase in the C-index and specificity while sensitivity remained unchanged. Among these mental health predictors, depressive symptom score produced the greatest improvements in both C-index (difference of 0.005, 95% confidence interval 0.004-0.006) and specificity (difference of 0.89%). Depressive symptom score showed similar small improvements in female and male validation sets. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that the inclusion of measures of depression and anxiety in PREVENT would have little additional effect on the risk classification of CVD at the population level and may not be worthwhile. © 2025 Canadian Medical Association.

The micronutrients B12 and betaine contribute directly to DNA methylation and have been shown to be abnormally elevated in blood samples from people with AN. Methods: We measured plasma B12 and betaine levels, as well as leukocyte DNA methylation levels, among women with active AN (AN-active group), those in 1-year remission from AN (AN-remitted group), and those who had never experienced an eating disorder (NED group). We compared the groups on micronutrient levels and on the strength of association between micronutrients and methylation. Results: We included 64 women in the AN-active group, 49 in the AN-remitted group, and 49 in the NED group. Relative to those with NED (B12: mean 339.6 [standard deviation (SD) 224.3] μmol/L; betaine: mean 33.74 [SD 17.10] μmol/L), participants with active AN showed high B12 and betaine (B12: mean 571.0 [SD 505.2] μmol/L; betaine: mean 43.73 [SD 22.50] μmol/L); AN-remitted participants had elevated B12 alone (B12: mean 588.2 [SD 379.9] μmol/L; betaine: mean 33.50 [SD 19.20] μmol/L). There were also group-based differences in the strength of association between B12 and site-specific DNA methylation at genes regulating insulin function, glucose metabolism, cell regulation, and neurotransmitter function. These associations between B12 and methylation levels were generally stronger among those without an ED than among those with either active or remitted AN. Limitations: The extent to which plasma nutrient levels provide a meaningful proxy to cellular processes affecting DNA methylation is uncertain and the sample size limits the stability of results. We included only biological females in this investigation. Conclusion: Elevated B12 levels in AN resemble elevations reported among people with autoimmune, neoplastic, or other disorders. Such elevations imply that plasma B12 levels may misrepresent nutritional status among people with AN. Observed associations between levels of B12 and methylation at certain gene regions have ambiguous importance, but may indicate an influence of nutritional status on epigenetic mechanisms or may be the coincidence of separate processes that independently affect levels of micronutrients and DNA methylation. © 2025 CMA Impact Inc.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000617442,Anorexia nervosa; Betaine; Pathophysiology

This potential countermeasure has been demonstrated to enhance survival in irradiated mice. To investigate the toxicity and safety profile of this agent, 14 nonhuman primates (NHPs, rhesus macaques) were administered two different doses of BBT-059 subcutaneously 24 h after 4 Gy total-body irradiation and were monitored for the next 60 days postirradiation. Blood samples were investigated for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this agent and its effects on complete blood counts, cytokines, vital signs, and metabolomics. No adverse health effects were observed in either treatment group. Radiation-induced metabolomic dysregulation was observed in both treatment groups, and BBT-059 afforded some short-term radiomitigation. A few pathways were commonly dysregulated by radiation exposure including steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways, fatty acid activation, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Notably, radiation-induced dysregulation to the linoleate metabolism pathway was significantly mitigated by either dose of BBT-059. In brief, this study suggests that BBT-059 has a good safety profile in irradiated NHPs and that its development as a medical countermeasure for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for human use should be continued.  © 2025 by Radiation Research Society.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218349106,Acute Radiation Syndrome; Pharmacodynamics
Kulkarni K.; Hussain T.,Megalin A Sidekick or Nemesis of the Kidney?,2025,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology,10.1681/ASN.0000000572,"Megalin is an endocytic receptor in the proximal tubules that reabsorbs filtered proteins in the kidneys. Recycling of megalin after endocytosis and its expression on the apical plasma membrane of the proximal tubule are critical for its function. The expression of megalin in the kidney undergoes dynamic changes under physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. Receptors and various effector signaling components regulate megalin expression and, potentially, function. Genetic manipulation and rare mutations in megalin suggest that a lack of or deficiency in megalin expression/function promotes tubular proteinuria and albuminuria. However, the role of megalin in kidney diseases associated with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and nephrotoxicity remains unclear. To address these questions, animal and human studies have indicated megalin as a protective, injurious, and potentially urinary marker of nephropathy. This article reviews the literature on the regulation of megalin expression and the role of megalin in the pathophysiology of the kidney under experimental and clinical conditions. Moreover, this review articulates the need for studies that can clarify whether megalin can serve as a therapeutic target, in one way or the other, to treat kidney disease. © 2024 The Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210978980,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

METHODS: The data of 2545 patients registered in our hospital database between 2017 and 2024 with a diagnosis of vertigo were retrospectively analyzed and 102 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and 100 patients with ACI were included in the study. Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test were used to compare variables between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to investigate the predictive value of the data. RESULTS: The CAR and SII values were significantly higher in the ACI group compared to the BPPV group (p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) were as follows: CAR=0.768 (95% CI, 0.705-0.832), white blood cell count (WBC)=0.735 (95% CI, 0.667-0.802), monocytes=0.622 (95% CI, 0.544-0.699), red cell distribution width-standard deviation (RDW-SD)=0.600 (95% CI, 0.522-0.678), SII=0.674 (95% CI, 0.599-0.748), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)=0.687 (95% CI, 0.613-0.761). CONCLUSION: CAR and SII could be useful biomarkers to differentiate between ACI and BPPV in vertigo patients, but further validation is needed in larger studies.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study used Aetna administrative claims data from a cohort of fully insured commercial and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries with diabetes and with coverage for medical and pharmacy benefits. The index date was the first CGM pharmacy or medical claim observed between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. Change in hemoglobin A1c was calculated using values from 3 months before and the latest values 10-12 months after the index date. HCRU was measured 12 months before and after the index date. Data were analyzed by the following patient groups: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes (T2D) on intensive insulin therapy, T2D on basal-only insulin therapy, and T2D not on insulin therapy. RESULTS: Data from 7,336 patients (74% T2D, mean age 57 years, 42% Medicare-insured, 54% male, 56% White) were analyzed. Beneficiaries with available A1c data (n=1,063) showed a significant improvement in A1c after CGM initiation (−0.7%, P<0.0001), including −0.9% change in the T2D not on insulin group (n=264). For the overall cohort, the number of patients with diabetes-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits decreased significantly by 67% and 40%, respectively (P<0.0001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that CGM use was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in A1c and reduced HCRU, suggesting potential for population-level clinical benefits, especially for patients not using insulin.

People with T2D are more likely to have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Medical associations recommend cardioprotective antidiabetic medications, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with T2D with established, or a high risk of, ASCVD, but not all eligible patients receive these medications. OBJECTIVE: To describe demographic/clinical characteristics and antidiabetic medication prescription patterns and compare HCRU and costs among patients with T2D and ASCVD with or without SGLT2i and/or GLP-1 RA use. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Merative MarketScan database of longitudinal US health care claims data with patients enrolled from July 1, 2014, to December 31, 2022. Patients with T2D and ASCVD receiving SGLT2is and/or GLP-1 RAs (case cohort) were compared with patients with T2D and ASCVD not receiving SGLT2is and/or GLP-1 RAs (control cohort) during a 12-month baseline period pre-index and a 12-month follow-up period post-index. The index date was SGLT2i/GLP-1 RA prescription for the case cohort and random health care visit for the control cohort. Baseline patient characteristics are reported before propensity score matching (PSM); HCRU and medical costs are reported after PSM. RESULTS: Before PSM, each cohort included 3,386 patients; after PSM, each cohort included 2,351 patients. Patients in the case cohort were significantly more likely to experience myocardial infarction (case, 26.2%; control, 21.5%; P<0.001) or peripheral artery disease (case, 28.6%; control, 26.1%; P<0.024) during the baseline period. Patients in the case cohort had significantly lower baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index scores than patients in the control cohort (case, 1.8; control, 2.1; P<0.001). Patients in the case cohort had significantly fewer all-cause inpatient visits per patient (case, 0.4; control, 0.6; P<0.001) and all-cause emergency department visits per patient (case, 0.9; control, 1.0; P=0.024). Patients in the case cohort had significantly lower all-cause inpatient costs (case, $13,977; control, $22,056; P<0.001), other all-cause outpatient costs (case, $16,504; control, $24,739; P<0.001), and all-cause total medical costs including pharmacy costs (case, $51,143; control, $58,648; P=0.01) in the 12-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T2D and ASCVD receiving SGLT2is and/ or GLP-1 RAs within 12 months of ASCVD diagnosis may benefit from lower HCRU and costs.

Recently, a US real-world study found statistically significant improvements in A1c levels among patients using GLP-1 RA and a CGM device, compared with a matched cohort receiving only GLP-1 RA. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness from a US payer perspective of initiating CGM (FreeStyle Libre Systems) in people living with T2DM using a GLP-1 RA therapy, compared with GLP-1 RA alone. METHODS: A patient-level microsimulation model was run for 10,000 patients over a lifetime horizon with 3.0% discounting for costs and utilities. Patient characteristics were based on the overall population of the US real-world study and the subgroup of patients not using intensive insulin. The effect of CGM was modeled as a persistent reduction in A1c compared with GLP-1 RA alone (overall=0.37%; patients not using intensive insulin=0.34%). Costs ($2,023) and disutilities were applied to diabetes complications and acute diabetic events. Outcomes were assessed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (incremental costs/incremental QALYs) for GLP-1 RA plus CGM vs GLP-1 RA alone was $40,968/QALY in the overall cohort (cost=$484,180 vs $473,938; QALYs=13.37 vs 13.12). Among patients not using intensive insulin, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $43,095/QALY. Scenario analysis showed that the model results were robust to changing assumptions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that GLP-1 RA plus CGM had a 64% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: From a US payer perspective, CGM is cost-effective when added to GLP-1 RA therapies for the treatment of T2DM, including for patients not using intensive insulin.

Among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), low medication adherence is linked with inadequate glycemic management and increased diabetes-related complications. Adherence to glucose-lowering, lipid-lowering, and antihypertensive medications may be impacted by the number of cardiometabolic medications taken by adults with T2D, including American Indian adults. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between medication adherence and the number of cardiometabolic medications among American Indian adults with T2D using Tribal health services, a health care system where all medical care and medications are provided free of charge. METHODS: We used 2019 medication dispensing data and patient data from the electronic health records of the Choctaw Nation Health Services Authority. Our sample included 6,774 American Indian adults aged 20 years and older, previously diagnosed with T2D, who received at least 1 cardiometabolic medication from a Choctaw Nation Health Services Authority pharmacy. We measured medication adherence as the proportion of days covered (PDC; possible range 0-1). Analysis of variance and chi-square tests were used to examine the association between the number of medications and patient characteristics. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the association of adherence with patient characteristics. RESULTS: The sample mean age was 58.4 (SD=13.2) years; 63.4% were aged 55 years or older; 47.8% were male; 49.6% were single; 36.9% had comorbidities. 30.9% were prescribed 2 or fewer medications, 43.1% were prescribed greater than 2 to 4 medications, and 26.0% were prescribed more than 4 medications. 71.7% had noninsulin glucose-lowering medications, 68% had lipid-lowering medication, and 90% had antihypertensive medications. Overall, 60.6% of the sample were adherent (PDC≥0.80), including 49% of those with 2 or fewer medications, 62% of those with greater than 2 to 4 medications, and 72% with more than 4 medications. In a multiple regression model, adherence was positively associated with the number of medications (b=0.026, P<0.001), age 55 years or older (b=0.062, P<0.001), male sex (b=0.009, P=0.046), and presence of comorbidities (b=0.033, P<0.001) but negatively associated with being single (b=−0.034, P<0.001) and insulin usage (b=−0.019, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the association between a higher number of cardiometabolic medications and better adherence in American Indian adults diagnosed with T2D whose medications were provided without cost to the patients. Medication cost is a well-known medication adherence barrier. Future studies should further examine factors associated with nonadherence in this population, such as younger age and fewer medications.

Two prospective, detailed hip fracture databases of 2 different hospitals (hospital A, training cohort; hospital B, testing cohort) were utilized to obtain data. On the basis of the literature, the results of a univariable analysis, and expert opinion, 26 candidate predictors of 30-day mortality were selected. Subsequently, the training of the model, including variable selection, was performed on the training cohort (hospital A) with use of adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. External validation was performed on the testing cohort (hospital B).Results:A total of 3,523 patients were analyzed, of whom 302 (8.6%) died within 30 days after surgery. After the LASSO analysis, 7 of the 26 variables were included in the prediction model: Age, gender, an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 4, dementia, albumin level, Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living total score, and residence in a nursing home. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.789 in the training cohort and 0.775 in the testing cohort. The calibration curve showed good consistency between observed and predicted 30-day mortality.Conclusions:The Rotterdam Hip Fracture Mortality Prediction-30 Days (RHMP-30) was developed and externally validated, and showed adequate performance in predicting 30-day mortality following hip fracture surgery. The RHMP-30 will be helpful for shared decision-making with patients regarding hip fracture treatment.Level of Evidence:Prognostic Level II.

Hoellwarth J.S.; Al-Jawazneh S.; Oomatia A.; Tetsworth K.; Al Muderis M.,Transfemoral Osseointegration for Amputees with Well-Managed Diabetes Mellitus,2024,JBJS Open Access,10.2106/JBJS.OA.23.00168,"Background: The most common reason for lower-extremity amputations remains the management of complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or peripheral vascular disease. Traditional socket prostheses remain the rehabilitation standard, although transcutaneous osseointegration for amputees (TOFA) is proving a viable alternative. Limited studies of TOFA for vascular amputees have been published, but no study has focused on TOFA for patients with DM, neglecting this important patient population. The primary aim of the present study exploring this potential care option was to report the frequencies and types of adverse events following TOFA for patients with well-controlled DM. The secondary aims were to report their mobility and quality-of-life changes. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of 17 consecutive patients with well-controlled DM who had undergone unilateral transfemoral TOFA from 2013 to 2019 and had been followed for at least 2 years. Outcomes were perioperative complications, additional surgery (soft-tissue refashioning, debridement, implant removal, periprosthetic fracture treatment), mobility (daily prosthesis wear hours, K-level, Timed Up and Go Test, 6-Minute Walk Test), and patient-reported outcomes (Questionnaire for Persons with a Transfemoral Amputation, Short Form-36). Results: There were no perioperative systemic complications, deaths, or proximal amputations. Two patients (12%) sustained a periprosthetic fracture following a fall, managed by internal fixation with implant retention, and regained independent ambulation. Eight patients (47%) had additional surgery or surgeries for non-traumatic complications: 4 (24%) had soft-tissue refashioning, 3 (18%) had debridement, and 3 others had implant removal with subsequent revision osseointegration for aseptic loosening (1) or infection (2). The proportion of patients wearing their prosthesis at least 8 hours daily improved from 5 (36%) to 11 (79%) of 14 (p = 0.054). The proportion of patients who achieved at least K-level 2 improved from 6% to 94% (p < 0.001). Other changes were not significant. Conclusions: Contraindicating TOFA for all patients with DM seems draconian. Patients with well-controlled DM experienced significant mobility improvements, although additional surgery was somewhat common. Improvements in selection criteria or surgical technique to reduce risks are needed so that TOFA can be routinely considered for amputees with well-controlled DM.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

Currently, there are no gold-standard tests available. An ideal test would be simple to implement, cost-effective, and readily available. We aimed to determine the best single or combined serological or synovial markers for diagnosing PJIs.Methods:There were 177 of 313 patients who had PJIs between April 2012 and March 2023 and a control group of 60 patients who were included in this retrospective review. The PJIs were diagnosed using Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) and European Bone and Joint Infection Society (EBJIS) criteria. Serum (C-reactive protein [CRP], white blood-cell [WBC] count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], polymorphonuclear neutrophil percentage [PMN%]), and synovial fluid (WBC, NLR, PMN%) parameters were compared between the 2 groups. We determined the sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and cutoff values (COV) for each marker. We determined the best combination of markers to diagnose PJIs. There was no statistical significance between the demographic data of the control and treatment groups.Results:The S-CRP had the highest AUC of 0.912 with a COV of 16.15 mg/dL (Sensitivity 79.6%, Specificity 97.8%). The combination of tests, S-CRP, synovial fluid (SF-WBC), and S-NLR demonstrated the highest AUC of 0.946 (Sensitivity 93%, Specificity 90.9%). The COV for SF-WBC was 5.75 cells/L (AUC 0.803; Sensitivity 70.3%, Specificity 97.1%); S-NLR COV was 3.659 (AUC 0.803; Sensitivity 67.3%, Specificity 88%).Conclusion:We found the combination of S-CRP, SF-WBC, and S-NLR to be valuable in diagnosing PJI with high sensitivities and specificities. It can be easily implemented by clinicians without additional cost or equipment. It is important to use this with a thorough clinical and physical examination as well as other modalities (i.e., MSIS/EBJIS criteria). Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D (VitD) supplementation on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in CHF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Methods: A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in HFrEF patients. Patients were randomized to receive two doses of 200,000 IU VitD3 (VitD group) or saline solution (placebo group) at a two-week interval. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and renin concentrations were assessed at baseline and one month after the first dose. The primary outcome was plasma renin change. The study was registered at the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry as PACTR201908774181973. Results: Forty patients in each group completed the trial. At baseline, hypovitaminosis D and hyperreninemia were found in 85% and 77.5% of patients, respectively, with no differences between VitD and placebo groups. VitD supplementation resulted in an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the VitD group, only. In parallel, plasma renin decreased in the VitD group [renin change: median (25th percentile; 75th percentile), -34.9 (-110; -7.1)], but did not change in the placebo group [1.35 (-1.2; 8.8)]. No significant changes were found for clinical, echocardiographic, and other biochemical parameters in both groups. Conclusions: A mega-dose of vitamin D resulted in middle-term RAAS suppression but didn’t affect cardiac function and clinical features in HFrEF patients. Further research with longer follow-ups is needed to evaluate whether persistent adequate VitD status results in long-term RAAS suppression and cardiac function improvement. © 2025 HBKU Press.

T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are increased in individuals with type 1 diabetes and alterations in Tfh-like cells in the peripheral blood predicted individual responses to abatacept. Tfh cells support GC responses and depend on the transcriptional repressor BCL6 for their maturation. Therefore, we hypothesized that CD4-driven deletion of Bcl6 would disrupt essential T-and B-cell interactions in GCs to prevent type 1 diabetes. To test this hypothesis, we generated Bcl6fl/fl-CD4.Cre.NOD mice and found they were completely protected against diabetes. Insulitis severity and tertiary lymphoid structure organization were preserved in the pancreas of Bcl6fl/fl-CD4. Cre.NOD mice, which did not show decreases in CD4+, CD8+, and B-cell numbers in the pancreas and draining lymph nodes, relative to control Bcl6fl/fl .NOD mice. CD4driven loss of functional BCL6 resulted in significantly reduced GC B-cell and Tfh-cell numbers in the pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreas at late prediabetic intervals.

Little is known, however, about the immediate regulation of islet hormonal output by nicotine, an agonist of ionotropic cholinergic receptors. We investigated this by imaging cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics in mouse and human islets using confocal microscopy and measuring glucagon secretion in response to the alkaloid from isolated mouse islets. Nicotine acutely stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ in glucagonsecreting α-cells but not in insulin-secreting β-cells. The 2.8-± 0.5-fold (P < 0.05) increase in Ca2+, observed in >70% of α-cells, correlated well with a 2.5-± 0.3-fold stimulation of glucagon secretion. Nicotine-induced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ relied on influx from the extracellular compartment rather than release of the cation from intracellular depots. Metabotropic cholinergic signaling, monitored at the level of intracellular diacylglycerol, was limited to 69% of α-cells versus 94% of β-cells. We conclude that parasympathetic regulation of pancreatic islet hormone release uses different signaling pathways in β-cells (metabotropic) and α-cells (metabotropic and ionotropic), resulting in the fine-tuning of acetylcholine-induced glucagon exocytosis. Sustained nicotinic stimulation is, therefore, likely to attenuate insulin sensitivity by increasing glucagon release. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213393784,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Homozygous mutations in IER3IP1 have been found in individuals with microcephaly and neonatal diabetes, yet the underlying mechanism causing b-cell failure remains unclear. Here, we used differentiation of genomeedited stem cells into pancreatic islet cells to elucidate the molecular basis of IER3IP1 neonatal diabetes. Using CRISPR/Cas9 we generated two distinct IER3IP1 mutant human embryonic stem cell lines: a homozygous knock-in model of a patient mutation (IER3IP1V21G), and a knockout (KO) model (IER3IP12/2). While these mutant stem cell lines differentiated normally into definitive endoderm and pancreatic progenitors, we observed that IER3IP1-KO stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) presented a significant decrease in b-cell numbers and elevated ER stress. Retention using selective hooks assay revealed a threefold reduction in ER-to-Golgi trafficking of proinsulin in IER3IP1 mutant b-cells. Additionally, IER3IP1 mutant SCislets implanted into immunocompromised mice displayed defective human insulin secretion, indicating the deleterious impact of IER3IP1 mutations on b-cell function. Our study provides valuable insights into the role of IER3IP1 in human b-cell biology and establishes a useful model to investigate ER-to-Golgi trafficking defects within b-cells. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001444972,PDX1; Proinsulin

Evidence on benefits of achieving HbA1c targets close to normal values is scant. Individuals with newly diagnosed T2D, without CVD at baseline, were identified in an Italian clinical registry (n = 251,339). We adopted three definitions of early exposure periods (0–1, 0–2, and 0–3 years). Mean HbA1c was categorized into HbA1c <5.7%, 5.7–6.4%, 6.5–7.0%, 7.1–8.0%, and >8.0%. The outcome was the incidence of major cardiovascular events. After a mean follow-up of 4.6 ± 2.9 years, at multivariate Cox regression analysis, compared with mean HbA1c <5.7% during the first year after diagnosis, the increase in the risk of CVD was 24%, 42%, 49%, and 56% for patients with HbA1c of 5.7–6.4%, 6.5–7.0%, 7.1–8.0%, and >8.0%, respectively.

This study aimed to de-cipher the causal associations of circulating proteins with fasting glucose (FG), 2-h glucose after an oral glucose challenge (2hGlu), fasting insulin (FI), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using large-scale proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Genetic data on plasma proteomes were obtained from 10 proteomic genome-wide association studies. Both cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and cis + trans-pQTLs MR analyses were conducted. Bayesian colocalization, Steiger filtering analysis, assessment of protein-altering variants, and mapping expression QTLs to pQTLs were performed to investigate the reliability of the MR findings. Protein-protein interaction, pathway enrichment analysis, and evaluation of drug targets were performed. Thirty-three proteins were identified with causal effects on FG, FI, or HbA1c but not 2hGlu in the cis-pQTL analysis, and 93 proteins had causal effects on glycemic traits in the cis + trans-pQTLs analysis. Most proteins were either considered druggable or drug targets. In conclusion, many novel circulating protein biomarkers were identified to be causally associated with glycemic traits. These biomarkers enhance the understanding of molecular etiology and provide insights into the screening, monitoring, and treatment of diabetes. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213308629,Druggability; Genetic Association; Genome-wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization; Proteome

We investigated the association of the proteomic signature of BMI and T2D and examined whether the proteomic signature of BMI improves the prediction of T2D risk. This study included 41,427 adults in the UK Biobank who were free of T2D at baseline and had complete data on proteomics metrics as-sessed by the antibody-based Olink assay. The main exposure was a proteomic BMI (pro-BMI) score calculated from 67 preidentified plasma proteins associated with BMI. During a median follow-up of 13.7 years, 2,030 incident events of T2D were documented. We observed that a higher pro-BMI score was significantly associated with a higher risk of T2D independent of actual BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and polygenic risk score for BMI (hazard ratio compar-ing the highest with the lowest quartiles was 3.81; 95% CI 3.08–4.71). The pro-BMI score significantly increased the C index when added to a reference model with age, sex, and BMI (C index change, 0.023; 95% CI 0.018–0.027). The prote-omic signature of BMI is significantly associated with the risk of T2D independent of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and genetic susceptibility to obesity. When added to the actual BMI, the proteomic signature of BMI provides significant but modest improvement in discrimination. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216607295,Quartile

Here, we aimed to perform large meta–genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of C-peptide and AAD in T1D and to identify the HLA allele/ haplotypes associated with C-peptide and AAD. A total of 7,252 and 7,923 European individuals with T1D were included in C-peptide and AAD GWAS, respectively. HLADQB1*06:02, which is strongly protective against T1D, was associated with higher C-peptide. HLA-DQB1*03:02, HLA-DRB1*03:01, and HLA-A*24:02, which increase T1D risk, were independently associated with younger AAD. HLA-DR3-DR4 haplotype combination, the strongest T1D susceptibility factor, was associated with younger AAD. Outside the HLA region, rs115673528 on chromosome 5 (Chr5) (GABRG2) was associated with C-peptide, and an indel, rs111970692, on Chr15 within CTSH, a known T1D locus, was associated with AAD. Genetically predicted CTSH expression, methylation, and protein levels were associated with AAD. Mendelian randomization analysis suggested that higher levels of pro-cathepsin H reduced AAD. In conclusion, some HLA allele/haplotypes associated with T1D also contribute to variability of C-peptide and AAD. Outside HLA, T1D loci were generally not associated with C-peptide or AAD.

Leveraging genome-wide association studies of type 1 diabetes (18,942 case and 501,638 control individuals of European ancestry) and circulating protein abundances (10,708 European ancestry individuals), Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted to assess the associations between circulating abundances of 1,560 candidate proteins and the risk of type 1 diabetes, followed by multiple sensitivity and colocalization analyses, horizontal pleiotropy examinations, and replications. Bulk tissue and single-cell gene expression enrichment analyses were performed to explore candidate tissues and cell types for prioritized proteins. After validating Mendelian randomization assumptions and colocalization evidence, we found that genetically predicted circulating abundances of CTSH (odds ratio [OR] 1.17 per 1 SD increase; 95% CI 1.10–1.24), IL27RA (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.07–1.19), SIRPG (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.26–1.49), and PGM1 (OR 1.66; 95% CI 1.40–1.96) were associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes. These findings were consistently replicated in other cohorts. CTSH, IL27RA, and SIRPG were strongly enriched in immune system-related tissues, while PGM1 was enriched in muscle and liver tissues. Among immune cells, CTSH was enriched in B cells and myeloid cells, while SIRPG was enriched in T cells and natural killer cells.

Here, we performed a low-rate glucose infusion in control participants without diabetes and in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to better understand this phenomenon. Glucose kinetics, hormones, and metabolites were measured during a 1 mg/kg/min glucose infusion (90 min), which rapidly increased glucose by ~0.3 mmol/L in control participants. Insulin concentrations and secretion quickly increased by ~20%, resulting in a ~40% suppression of EGP, while glucose disposal remained unchanged. Free fatty acids (FFAs) and glucagon were gradually suppressed to ~30% below baseline at 60 min. When repeated under constant basal insulin concentrations in participants with T1D, glucose infusion caused only partial and transient EGP suppression; hence, glucose increased in a near-linear manner, reaching levels ~2 mmol/L above baseline at 90 min. FFAs and glucagon remained unchanged, while glucose disposal modestly increased. This demonstrates that small glycemic increments exert subtle stimulatory effects on insulin secretion that have potent metabolic actions on the liver and adipose tissue. It is conceivable that subtle increases in glucose could potentially serve as a signal for b-cell adaptation. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006578454,Basal (medicine); Carbohydrate Metabolism

Tissue-resident macrophages serve multiple roles, including managing inflammatory tone and regulating parenchymal iron ho-meostasis, thus protecting against metabolic dysfunction upon iron overload. The scavenger receptor CD163 is uniquely present on tissue-resident macrophages and plays a significant role in iron homeostasis by clear-ing extracellular hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes, thereby limiting oxidative damage caused by free hemoglobin in metabolic tissues. We show that the absence of CD163 exacerbates glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in male mice with obesity. Additionally, loss of CD163 reduced the expression of iron regulatory genes (Tfr1, Cisd1, Slc40a1) in adipose tissue macro-phages and anti-inflammatory (M2-like) bone marrow– derived macrophages (BMDMs). Furthermore, CD163 deficiency mediated a proinflammatory shift and limited hemoglobin scavenging specifically in M2-like BMDMs. To this end, iron buffering was diminished in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) macrophages in vivo, which culminated in iron spillover into adipocytes and CD45+ CD11B2 nonmyeloid immune cells in iWAT. These findings show that CD163 on tissue-resident macrophages is critical for their anti-inflammatory and hemoglobin scavenging roles, and its absence results in impaired systemic insulin action in an obese setting. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210453847,Adipose tissue macrophages; CD163; Scavenger Receptor

Three groups of patients with T2DM (n = 12 per group) with an LV ejection fraction (EF) #50% received incremental infusions of β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OH-B) for 3–6 h to increase the plasma β-OH-B concentration throughout the physiologic (groups I and II) and pharmacologic (group III) range. Cardiac MRI was performed at baseline and after each β-OH-B infusion to provide measures of cardiac function. On a separate day, group II also received a sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) infusion, thus serving as their own control for time, volume, and pH. Additionally, group II underwent positron emission tomography study with18F-fluoro2-deoxyglucose to examine effect of hyperketonemia on MGU. Groups I, II, and III achieved plasma β-OH-B levels (mean ± SEM) of 0.7 ± 0.3, 1.6 ± 0.2, 3.2 ± 0.2 mmol/L, respectively. Cardiac output (CO), LVEF, and stroke volume (SV) increased significantly during β-OH-B infusion in groups II (CO, from 4.54 to 5.30; EF, 39.9 to 43.8; SV, 70.3 to 80.0) and III (CO, from 5.93 to 7.16; EF, 41.1 to 47.5; SV, 89.0 to 108.4), and did not change with NaHCO3 infusion in group II. The increase in LVEF was greatest in group III (P < 0.001 vs. group II). MGU and MBF were not altered by β-OH-B. In patients with T2DM and LVEF #50%, increased plasma β-OH-B level significantly increased LV function dose dependently. Because MGU did not change, the myocardial benefit of β-OH-B resulted from providing an additional fuel for the heart without inhibiting MGU. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213366005,Deoxyglucose

The influence of genetically proxied LDL cholesterol lowering through proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) on T2D in non-European populations is not well established. A drug target Mendelian randomization approach was used to assess the effects of PCSK9 and HMGCR inhibition on T2D risk and glycemic traits in five populations: East Asian (EAS), South Asian (SAS), Hispanic (HISP), African (AFR), and Europe (EUR). Our study did not find relationships between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and T2D risk in the EAS (odds ratio [OR] 1.02; 95% CI 0.95-1.10), SAS (1.05; 0.97-1.14), HISP (1.03; 0.94-1.12), or EUR population (1.04; 0.98-1.11). However, in the AFR population, primary analyses suggested an increased risk of T2D resulting from PCSK9 inhibition (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.058-2.22; P = 0.024), although this was not supported in sensitivity analyses. Genetically proxied HMGCR inhibition was associated with an increased risk of T2D in SAS (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.30-1.61; P = 9.8 × 10-12), EAS (1.36; 1.22-1.51; P = 4.2 × 10-10), and EUR populations (1.52; 1.21-1.90; P = 3.3 × 10-4). These results were consistent across various sensitivity analyses, including colocalization, indicating a robust finding. The findings indicate a neutral impact of long-term PCSK9 inhibition on T2D and glycemic markers in most non-EUR populations, with a potential increased risk in AFR cohorts. By contrast, HMGCR inhibition increased the risk of T2D in SAS, EAS, and EUR cohorts, underscoring the need to consider diversity in genetic research on metabolic diseases. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213597070,Mendelian Randomization; PCSK9

Some individuals carrying disease-causing variants do not develop autoimmune diabetes, even though they develop another autoimmune disease. We aimed to determine whether type 1 diabetes polygenic risk contributes to phenotypic presentation in monogenic autoimmune diabetes. We used a 67 single nucleotide polymorphism type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (T1D-GRS) to determine polygenic risk in 62 individuals with monogenic autoimmune diabetes and 180 control individuals with nonautoimmune neonatal diabetes (NDM). We used population-based control participants (n = 10,405) and individuals with type 1 diabetes (n = 285) as a comparator. Individuals with monogenic autoimmune diabetes had higher T1D-GRSs compared with individuals with nonautoimmune NDM (mean 11.3 vs. 9.8; P = 1.7 × 1025) and controls (mean 10.3; P = 7.5 ×1026), but the levels were markedly lower than those for individuals with type 1 diabetes (14.9; P = 3.3 ×10221). These differences were explained by individuals with monogenic autoimmune diabetes having higher class II HLA genetic risk, specifically from the DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01 haplotype (DR3-DQ2) (P < 0.01). In the presence of monogenic autoimmunity, the polygenic class II HLA susceptibility contributes to development of autoimmune diabetes. This suggests a role of class II HLA in targeting the dysregulated immune response toward the b-cell. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216606629,Autoimmune diabetes
Chanoine J.-P.; Thompson D.M.; Lehman A.,Diabetes Associated With Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness (MIDD): From Pathogenic Variant to Phenotype,2025,Diabetes,10.2337/db24-0515,"Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) is a monogenic mitochondrial disorder caused by a pathogenic variant in the MT-TL1 gene encoding a leucine transfer RNA. We propose a new hypothesis that explains how the MT-TL1 variant causes impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes in MIDD. We suggest that diabetes in MIDD primarily depends on a variable combination of insulin resistance and impaired b-cell function that seems more likely to occur in the presence of high skeletal muscle heteroplasmy and moderate b-cell heteroplasmy for m.3243A>G. The underlying genetic defect generates oxidative stress and disrupts the tricarboxylic acid cycle, leading to mTORC1 hyperactivity and modifying mitochondrial retrograde signaling. mTORC1 hyperactivity contributes to insulin resistance and b-cell dysfunction and to an increased load of the m.3243A>G phenotypic variant. Abnormal mitochondrial signaling affects the nuclear epigenome and influences MIDD phenotype. We highlight evidence that, despite being an apparent pathogenic factor, heteroplasmy in the blood and in tissues does not fully explain the phenotypic variability of this condition and that other factors, including mtDNA copy number, additional nuclear or mitochondrial variants, environmental factors, and metabolic characteristics of the patient, may contribute. A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to MIDD will help inform novel management strategies for this form of diabetes. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216606436,Heteroplasmy; Mitochondrial disease

The 1-mg i.v. glucagon stimulation test (GST) is widely used to evaluate residual b-cell function; we previously reported that GST assessment of insulin secretory capacity is useful in assessing the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). However, recent reports have indicated that pharmacologic concentrations of glucagon stimulate insulin secretion through GLP-1 receptors, confounding the issue. The current studies were undertaken to reassess the reliability of the GST for evaluation of insulin secretory capacity under GLP-1RAs and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is). Our first study included individuals receiving GLP-1RA treatment, evaluated by the GST before and after treatment. Although the fasting C-peptide response (CPR) levels were elevated after treatment, the induction of insulin secretion by glucagon was significantly reduced. Our second study compared glucagon-induced insulin secretion between DPP-4i users and nonusers, assessed by the GST after propensity score matching. Although the fasting CPR levels were similar in the two investigations, glucagon-induced insulin secretion was significantly lower with DPP-4i use. These results suggest that the GST might underestimate insulin secretory capacity under incretin-based therapy. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210453931,Incretin

Prior studies support that the stress response protein REDD1 (regulated in development and DNA damage 1) contributes to the development of diabetes complications. This study investigated a potential role for REDD1 expression in podocytes in diabetes-induced podocyte loss and compromised glomerular filtration. Podocyte-specific REDD1 deletion protected against renal injury, as evidenced by reduced albuminuria, glomerular hypertrophy, and mesangial matrix deposition in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Podocytespecific REDD1 expression was required for diabetesinduced reduction in slit diaphragm (SD) proteins podocin and nephrin. Notably, podocyte-specific REDD1 deletion protected against podocytopenia and preserved glomerular basementmembrane and foot process architecture in diabetic mice. In the kidneys of diabeticmice and in human podocyte cultures exposed to hyperglycemic conditions, REDD1 was necessary for increased expression of the transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6) channel. More specifically, REDD1 promoted nuclear factorkB– dependent transcription of TRPC6, intracellular calcium entry, and cytoskeletal remodeling under hyperglycemic conditions. Overall, the findings provide new insight into the role of podocyte-specific REDD1 expression in renal pathology and support the possibility that therapeutics targeting REDD1 in podocytes could be beneficial forDN. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218081358,Nephrin; Podocin; Slit diaphragm; TRPC6

We analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of four affected and two unaffected females from an undiagnosed autosomal dominant familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) pedigree and identified only one novel heterozygous variant, p.Ala1603Tyr, in NOTCH3 meeting the filtering criteria. Further analysis of WES data of 222 patients with unexplained FPL identified two unrelated patients with FPL with novel heterozygous (p.Cys1600Tyr and p.Gln1552Pro) NOTCH3 variants. All variants were clustered in the heterodimerization domain of the negative regulatory region of NOTCH3. RNA sequencing and proteomics analysis of skin fibroblasts revealed significantly higherRNA and protein expression ofNOTCH3 and activation of widespread senescence pathways in the patients with FPL versus control study participants. NOTCH3 is highly expressed in adipose tissue and playsmany crucial roles in developmental patterning, cell fate decisions, regulation of cell survival, and proliferation.We conclude that gain-of-function missense variants in the negative regulatory region of NOTCH3 cause a novel subtype of FPL by activation of senescence pathways.

Here, we first built a large collection of human embryonic and fetal pancreases covering the first trimester of pregnancy to explore human endocrinogenesis.

This contrasts with rodents, in which glucagon-positive cells appear first, followed by insulin-positive and, finally, somatostatin- positive cells and highlights interspecies differences. We also detected bihormonal endocrine cells in 7 of 9 human pancreases between CS16 and CS18, which were no longer detected at later stages.We observed that cell distribution within human fetal islets resembles adult mouse islets, with a core of b-cells surrounded by a- and d-cells, differing from a more complex arrangement in adult human islets. This, in connection with the small size of human fetal islets when compared with adult islets, suggests that adult human islets may form by fusion of preexisting islets, in contrast to the mouse fission model.

In this study, we uncovered the novel function of HOXC4 in stimulating adipose thermogenesis. Our bioinformatic analysis indicated an enrichment of Hoxc4 coexpressed genes in metabolic pathways and linked HOXC4 polymorphisms to metabolic parameters, suggesting its involvement in metabolic regulation. In mouse brown adipose tissue, HOXC4 expression negatively correlated with body weight and positively correlated with Ucp1 expression. Through gainand loss-of-function experiments in mice, we established that HOXC4 is both sufficient and necessary for adipose thermogenesis, leading to enhanced cold tolerance and protection against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Human and mouse primary adipocyte models further confirmed that the thermogenic activation function of HOXC4 is cell autonomous. Mechanistically, HOXC4 collaborates with cofactor nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1) via its hexapeptide motif to form a transcriptional complex at the Ucp1 promoter, thereby promoting Ucp1 transcription and adipose thermogenesis. These findings delineate a novel mechanism by which HOXC4 drives thermogenic transcription and adipose energy metabolism, offering potential therapeutic targets for obesity-related metabolic disorders. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001346702,Thermogenin

However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to systematically evaluate the mediating roles of 3,283 plasma proteins in the link between COVID-19 susceptibility and T2D by conducting proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Reverse MR, validation in independent data sets, and colocalization analyses were conducted to verify the robustness of the MR results. Furthermore, mediation analysis was performed to quantify the mediating effects. MR analyses between protein and T2D-related phenotypes were conducted to enhance the comprehension of potential mechanisms. Finally, the druggability of the identified proteins was evaluated. Four proteins causally associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 (ABO, CD209, CUZD1, and QXOS2) exhibited significant causal links with T2D. The protein CD209, which exhibited significant associations in validation and colocalization analyses, was identified as the causal mediating protein. Mediation analysis indicated that CD209 significantly mediated the total effect from COVID-19 susceptibility to T2D (bindirect 0.083 [95% CI 0.014, 0.152], P = 0.019). Further MR analyses revealed significant associations between CD209 and hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and waist-to-hip ratio. Evaluation of druggability demonstrated that CD209 can bind to a-D-mannose and interact with nine targets of T2D drugs, including dipeptidyl peptidase 4.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA in T2D with different glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) were selected. Results were reported as risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% CIs. Finally, 10 RCTs involving 87,334 patients with T2D were included. In patients with an eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73 m2, GLP-1RA exhibited a superior ability to reduce the risk of all-cause death compared with SGLT-2i (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.58, 0.97), but it was less effective in reducing the risk of renal outcome (RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.15, 2.84) in patients with an eGFR 60–90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Conversely, in patients with eGFR 30–60 and 60–90 mL/min/1.73 m2, GLP-1RA did not show an advantage in reducing the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (RR 1.87 [95% CI 1.15, 3.04] and 1.37 [95% CI 1.05, 1.78], respectively). © 2025.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003979336,Dapagliflozin

We evaluated changes in β-cell secretory capacity in a single-center longitudinal analysis and examined relationships with measures of islet cell hormone metabolism and clinical measures of graft function (mixed-meal tolerance test [MMTT] C-peptide, BETA-2 score, and continuous glucose monitoring [CGM]). Eleven individuals received purified human pancreatic islets over one or two intraportal infusions to achieve insulin independence and were observed over amedian of 6 (interquartile range 5-7) years. β-Cell secretory capacity remained stable over 3 years before declining. Fasting glucagon and proinsulin secretory ratios under glucose potentiation were inversely correlatedwith AIRpot. A functional β-cell mass of 40% normal predicted insulin independence and was strongly predicted by ratio of MMTT C-peptide to glucose and BETA-2 score. A functional β-cell mass of >20% normal predicted excellent glycemic outcomes, including #1% time in range <60mg/dL, ≤2%time in range >180 mg/dL, and ≥90% time in range 70-180 mg/dL. β-Cell replacement approaches should target a functional β-cell mass >40% normal to provide sufficient islet reserve for sustained insulin independence. Ratio of MMTT C-peptide to glucose and BETA-2 score can inform changes in functional β-cell mass in the clinical setting. © 2025, American Diabetes Association Inc.

However, recent published differentiation protocols yield varying amounts of α- and β-cells amid heterogeneous cell populations. To visualize and isolate hESC-derived α- and β-cells, we generated a GLUCAGON-2A-mScarlet and INSULIN-2A-EGFP dual fluorescent reporter (INSEGFPGCGmScarlet) hESC line using CRISPR/Cas9. We established robust expression of EGFP and mScarlet fluorescent proteins in insulin- and glucagonexpressing cells, respectively, without compromising the differentiation or function of these cells. We also showed that the insulin- and glucagon-expressing bihormonal population at the maturing endocrine cell stage (stage 6) of our pancreatic islet differentiation lose insulin expression over time, while maintaining an α-like expression profile, suggesting these bihormonal cells are cell-autonomously fated to become α-like cells. We also demonstrated this cell line can be used to monitor hESC-derived insulin- and glucagon-expressing cells, and hESC-derived islet morphology in vivo, by transplanting them into the anterior chamber of the eye in mice. Together, the INSEGFPGCGmScarlet hESC line provides an efficient strategy for tracking populations of hESC-derived β- and α-like cells. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214444670,Alpha cell

However, the effects of CHIP on microvascular complications have not been evaluated in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study included 20,712 participants with T2D without prevalent diabetic microvascular complication (DMCs) and hematologic malignancy at baseline. CHIP and related phenotypes were identified using whole-exome sequencing derived from peripheral blood samples. The incidence of DMCs was defined as a composite of diabetic kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic neuropathy. Associations of any CHIP with incident DMCs and subtypes were assessed using Cox regression. Gene-specific analyses were also conducted to determine the effect of mutated driver genes with DMCs. During a median follow-up of 13.0 years, DMCs developed in 5,673 participants. Any CHIP was associated with a high risk of DMCs (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23; 95% CI 1.10–1.38; P < 0.001), specifically, diabetic retinopathy (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.13–1.57; P = 0.001) and diabetic kidney disease (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.10–1.45; P = 0.001), but not diabetic neuropathy. Gene-specific analyses suggested that DNMT3A, TET2, NF1, and spliceosome genes were associated with the risk of developing DMCs. CHIP increases the risk of developing DMCs in individuals with T2D, independently of other risk factors. These findings offer potential implications for the prevention and management of DMCs. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001421370,Indeterminate

However, these outcomes have not been adequately studied. We evaluated body composition, insulin sensitivity,metabolic health, and adipose tissue biology in women with obesity and lipedema (Obese-LIP) before and aftermoderate (~9%) diet-induced weight loss. At baseline, people with Obese-LIP had ~23% greater leg fat mass, ~11% lower android-to-gynoid ratio, and ~48% greater insulin sensitivity (all P < 0.05) thanwomenmatched on age, BMI, and whole-body adiposity. In Obese-LIP,macrophage content and expression of genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis were greater, whereas lymph/ angiogenesis-related genes were lower in thigh than abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Weight loss improved insulin sensitivity and decreased total fatmass, with similar relative reductions in abdominal and leg fatmasses, but without changes in markers of inflammation and fibrosis. These results demonstrate that affected adipose tissue in women with lipedema is characterized by increased inflammation and fibrogenesis, and alterations in lymphatic and vascular biology.

We analyzed two independent cohorts: PROPGER, which comprised 72 patients with painful and 67 with painless diabetic neuropathy recruited at the German Diabetes Center in Düusseldorf, and PROPENG, which comprised 27 patients with painful and 65 with painless diabetic neuropathy recruited at the University of Manchester in the U.K. Genome-wide methylation data were generated using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC v1.0 BeadChip. We used four different selection criteria to identify promising pain-related genes. Our findings revealed significant differences in methylation patterns between painful and painless diabetic neuropathy and identified a set of individual CpG sites of unique candidate genes associated with the painful phenotype. Several of these genes, including GCH1, MYT1L, and MED16, have been previously linked to pain-related phenotypes or diabetes. Through pathway enrichment analysis, we demonstrated that specific epigenetic signatures could contribute to the complex phenotype of diabetic neuropathy, and cluster analyses highlighted significant epigenetic dissimilarities between painful and painless phenotypes. Our results uncovered epigenetic differences between patients with painful and painless diabetic neuropathy and identified targeted genes linked to neuropathic pain through DNA methylation mechanisms. This approach holds promise for investigating other chronic pain conditions, such as secondary chronic pain from cancer treatment, thoracic surgery, and various transplant settings. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001741813,Candidate gene; Diabetic Neuropathy

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Adults with type 2 diabetes who had reused syringes and needles at least three times were randomly instructed either to not reuse or to reuse insulin syringes and needles five times. The primary outcomes assessed were glycemic control, pain scores, and skin complications (ecchymosis, lipohypertrophy, nodules, infection) at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, quality of life, microbiological contamination of syringes and needles, needle quality, and insulin injection technique. RESULTS Among the 71 participants (mean ± SD age 59.7 ± 8.8 years), 59% were women with a median duration of diabetes of 18 years (interquartile range 10-25 years) and a mean BMI of 31.7 ± 6.7 kg/m2. The group that reused syringes and needles experienced an increase in lipohypertrophy/nodules (0.16 ± 0.08, P = 0.040) but did not experience worsening pain or glycemic control, even when the syringes and needles were inserted into the skin with great effort. There was no difference in the total number of skin complications, quality of life, or microbiological contamination. Both groups improved treatment adherence, with a greater increase in the reuse group. CONCLUSIONS The reuse of syringes and needles is associated with a modest increase in lipohypertrophy/nodules but does not have a short-term impact on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211393553,Insulin pen; Interquartile range

Research Design and Methods: We conducted a quasiexperimental study using the Optum deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (January 2003 to December 2017). The intervention group included 5,582 patients with diabetes age 12–64 years switched by employers to PDL coverage; the control group included 5,582 matched patients whose employers offered no PDL. Outcomes included out-of-pocket costs, standardized costs, and 30-day fills for all medications because PDL-associated savings could be used to pay for medicines in other classes and for five therapeutic classes covered by the PDLs (oral diabetes medications, insulins, test strips, antihypertensive drugs, and lipid-lowering drugs). Results: Pre– to post–out-of-pocket spending for all medications declined by 29.7% in follow-up year 2 (95% CI 236.0, 223.4%) among PDL members relative to control individuals. Higher-income and lower-income PDL members experienced significant reductions in out-of-pocket spending for all medications in year 2 (30%) and for key therapeutic classes (range 223 to 267%). We found significant increases in use of key therapeutic classes in the overall population (range 8–15%) and in higher-income and lower-income PDL members (range 9–50%). Conclusions: PDLs offer an effective strategy for employers and insurers to lower member cost sharing and encourage increased use of important medications to prevent or manage chronic illnesses. For patients with diabetes, especially those with lower incomes, PDL coverage resulted in substantial and persistent reductions in out-of-pocket medication costs,medication use increases, and some increased use ofmore expensive products. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214657725,Natural experiment

This observational study aimed to clarify how each KDIGO category correlates with adverse outcomes in this patient group. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a cohort of 40,199 individuals with type 1 diabetes from the Swedish National Diabetes Register, we aimed to investigate the 1) prevalence of different KDIGO categories at base-line; within each category; and 3) association of baseline category with excess risk of five out-comes: a 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), kidney failure, major adverse kidney/CV events, and all-cause mortality. Cox regression analyses were con-ducted using three different reference categories: 1) the conventional low-risk “combined G1A1 + G2A1”; 2) “G1A1” alone to assess whether G2A1 had excess risk; and 3) “G1bA1” alone to evaluate whether eGFR $105 mL/min/1.73 m2 had increased risk. RESULTS Among 39,067 included patients, with a mean follow-up of 9.1 years, 18.5% presented with chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or albuminuria. A progressive increase in the incidence and adjusted hazard ratio for all studied outcomes was found with advancing eGFR and albuminuria categories, including in G2A1 (non-CKD). An eGFR $105 mL/min/1.73 m2 without albuminuria was not associated with increased risk. CONCLUSIONS A progressively increasing burden of all studied adverse outcomes was observed with advancing KDIGO categories.

The association between particulate matter with a diameter of <2.5 lm (PM2.5) exposure and prediabetes/ diabetes in adults is well documented, but the health effects of life course exposure remain unclear. This study evaluated the impact of PM2.5 exposure through-out various life stages on the prevalence of prediabetes/diabetes in adulthood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We included 4,551 individuals with 19,593 medical visits from two open cohorts in Taiwan and Hong Kong between 2000 and 2018. Ambient PM2.5 exposure was as-sessed using a satellite-based model, delivering a 2-year average exposure at a reso-lution of 1 km2. Logistic mixed-effects models were used to investigate longitudinal associations between PM2.5 exposure and the prevalence of prediabetes/diabetes. Life course models were used to examine the impact of PM2.5 exposure at different life stages on prediabetes/diabetes in adulthood. RESULTS Over an average follow-up period of 9.93 years, 1,660 individuals with prediabe-tes/diabetes were observed. For the longitudinal association, every 10 lg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with an increased odds of having prediabetes/ diabetes (odds ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.13, 1.54). The odds of adulthood prediabetes/ diabetes increased by 15%, 18%, and 29% for each 10 lg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure during school age, adolescence, and adulthood, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest a link between PM2.5 exposure during each life stage and the prevalence of prediabetes/diabetes in adulthood, with the health impacts of exposure during adulthood being slightly greater. This study underscores the need for life course air pollution control strategies to mitigate the substantial disease burden of diabetes. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213597367,Longitudinal Study; Prediabetes

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We developed and validated a new glucose tracer model in conjunction with an oral glucose tolerance test to determine IMGD, NIMGD, and TGD (sum of IMGD and NIMGD) after glucose ingestion in four groups of people: 1) lean with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 2) obese with insulin resistance and NGT due to hyperinsulinemia (Ob-NGT group), 3) obese with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) due to inadequate hyperinsulinemia (Ob-IGT group), and 4) obese with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes due to marked insulin insufficiency (Ob-T2D group). In addi-tion, we evaluated the effect of intensive lifestyle therapy (ILT) that caused ~15% weight loss on IMGD and NIMGD in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESULTS IMGD progressively decreased and NIMGD progressively increased from lean to Ob-NGT to Ob-IGT to Ob-T2D. IMGD accounted for about 70%, 65%, 50%, and 20% of TGD, and NIMGD accounted for ~40%, 35%, 50%, and 80% of TGD in lean, Ob-NGT, Ob-IGT and Ob-T2D, respectively. Although NIMGD was approximately twofold and approximately threefold higher in Ob-IGT and Ob-T2D compared with Ob-NGT, NIMGD only partially compensated for markedly impaired IMGD in the Ob-IGT and Ob-T2D. ILT in people with obesity and T2D increased IMGD and decreased NIMGD. CONCLUSIONS NIMGD is a major mechanism of postprandial TGD in people with insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213597082,Hyperinsulinemia

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the cardiovascular (CV) safety and efficacy of once-weekly ex-enatide SomaScan assay in 5,473 trial participants. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (ma-jor cardiovascular events [MACE]). Cox proportional hazards models controlling for confounders were used for time-to-event analyses to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI for a 1 SD increase in the biomarker concentrations. RESULTS The primary outcome occurred in 813 participants (14.9%). Higher levels of osteo-protegerin (HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03–1.20; P = 0.0047) and osteopontin (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02–1.18; P = 0.0095) were associated with an increased risk of MACE. The addition of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin to a clinical predictive model containing traditional CV risk factors provided minimal incremental value for MACE prediction (C-index 0.629 vs. 0.638; likelihood ratio test P < 0.001). Osteo-calcin and sclerostin were not associated with MACE. Osteocalcin had a nonlinear association with all-cause death and with CV death. CONCLUSIONS Higher levels of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin are associated with an increased risk of CV events in people with T2D, supporting the hypothesis that pathways involved in bone metabolism play a role in CV disease. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216715679,Mace; Osteopontin; Sclerostin

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Plasma apoC-I proteoforms were measured by mass spectrometry immunoassay at baseline in 4,742 nondiabetic participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and 524 participants with prediabetes in the Actos Now for Prevention of Diabetes (ACT NOW) study. The primary outcome was incident diabetes (fasting glucose [FG] $7.0mmol/L or hypoglycemicmedication use in MESA; FG$7.0mmol/L or 2-h glucose $11.1 mmol/L in an oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] in ACT NOW). Secondary outcomes were changes in FG and HOMA-IR in MESA, and OGTT-glucose area under the curve (AUCglucose) andMatsuda insulin sensitivity index (ISI) in ACT NOW. RESULTS In MESA, a higher C-I0/C-I was associated with lower risk of diabetes (n = 564 events; HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.79, 0.95] per SD; P = 0.0036; median follow-up, 9 years), and smaller increases (follow-up adjusted for baseline) in FG (20.5%; P < 0.0001) and HOMA-IR (22.9%; P = 0.011) after adjusting for baseline clinical and demographic covariates, including plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Total apoC-I concentrations were not associated with changes in FG, HOMA-IR, or incident diabetes. In ACT NOW, higher C-I0/C-I was associated with smaller increases in AUCglucose (21.8%; P = 0.0052), greater increases in ISI (7.2%; P = 0.0095), and lower risk of diabetes (n = 59 events; 0.66 [95% CI 0.48, 0.91]; P = 0.004; median follow-up, 2.5 years) after adjusting for treatment group and diabetes risk factors, including plasma lipids.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 1,442 participants were randomly assigned to one of four interventions: 1) MET (1,700 mg/day) plus MedDiet intervention (MET+MedDiet); 2) placebo plus MedDiet intervention; 3) MET (1,700 mg/day) alone; and 4) placebo alone. Participants were followed up for 3 years on average. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of major noncommunicable diseases (includ-ing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of type 2 diabetes and the changing prevalence of metabolic syndrome. RESULTS The crude incidence of the major noncommunicable diseases was 6.7 cases per 100 person-years in the MET+MedDiet group, 6.9 in the MET alone group, 13.3 in the placebo plus MedDiet group, and 11.3 in the placebo group. The differences were fully explained by the reduction of type 2 diabetes, which was 80% and 92% lower in the MET and MET+MedDiet groups, respectively, compared with placebo.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This cohort study included patients in Denmark diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 1996–2015 and followed until 2020. Patients were age and sex matched with as many as three general population individuals. Outcomes comprised 5-year cumulative incidences of first-time PAD, LE revascularization, and LE amputation. Age-and sex-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were computed using Cox regression. RESULTS The cohort comprised 349,454 patients with incident type 2 diabetes (53% male; median age 62 years) and 1,025,054 general population individuals. Among patients with diabetes, decreases in 5-year cumulative incidence of PAD (from 6.2 to 3.4%; aHR 0.55 [95% CI 0.52–0.57]), LE revascularization (from 0.8 to 0.6%; aHR 0.80 [95% CI 0.71–0.90]), and LE amputation (from 1.0 to 0.4%; aHR 0.45 [95% CI 0.40–0.51]) occurred from 1996–2000 to 2011–2015. LE amputation decreased at all amputation levels (hip/thigh, knee/lower leg, and ankle/foot/toe) during the study period.

We sought to define the relationship of longitudinal IR with radiographic imaging outcomes and examiner-identified incident lung disease in the Framingham Offspring Study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants without baseline lung disease underwent repeated measurements of fasting insulin and glucose levels over an average period of 13.6 years, from which time-weighted average HOMA-IR was calculated. Each participant then underwent a cardiac gated whole-lung computed tomography scan, which was analyzed for the presence of emphysema, interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs), and quantitative airway features. Incident lung disease was determined by a study examiner. The relationship of HOMA-IR to these outcomes was estimated in models adjusted for demographics, BMI, and lifetime smoking. RESULTS A total of 875 participants with longitudinal IR data and outcomes were identified. Their mean age was 51.5 years, and BMI was 26.7 kg/m2. HOMA-IR was temporally unstable, with a within-person SD approximately two-thirds of the between-person SD. In adjusted models, a 1 SD increase in log(HOMA-IR) z score was associated with higher odds of qualitative emphysema (odds ratio [OR] 1.33; 95% CI 1.04–1.70), ILAs (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.05–1.74), and modest increases in airway wall thickness and wall area percentage. These radiographic findings were corroborated by a positive association of HOMA-IR with incident lung disease.

AGEs represent a potential target to prevent or treat diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN). The current study aimed to characterize cutaneous carbonyl stress, oxidative stress, immune cells, and endothelial cell damage in early type 2 diabetes compared with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) using novel cutaneous biomarkers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Included were 160 individuals recently (≤12 months) diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 144 with NGT from the German Diabetes Study baseline cohort. Nerve function was assessed using electrophysiological, quantitative sensory, and clinical testing. Skin biopsies were obtained to analyze intraepidermal nerve fiber density, AGE autofluorescence, argpyrimidine area, and endothelial cell area. In addition, skin autofluorescence was measured noninvasively using the AGE reader. A subgroup with type 2 diabetes (n = 80) was reassessed 5 years later. RESULTS After adjustment for sex, age, HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, and BMI, argpyrimidine area (17.5 ± 18.8 vs. 11.7 ± 12.7%) was higher in recent-onset type 2 diabetes than in NGT (P < 0.05). AGE autofluorescence was inversely correlated with nerve conduction (e.g., peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity: r = 20.346) and pos-itively with AGE reader measurements in type 2 diabetes (r = 0.358, all P < 0.05), but not in NGT. Higher baseline AGE autofluorescence and lower endothelial cell area predicted the deterioration of clinical and neurophysiological measures after 5 years. CONCLUSIONS Cutaneous AGE markers were associated with neurophysiological deficits in re-cent-onset type 2 diabetes and predicted their progression after 5 years, substan-tiating the role of carbonyl stress in the development of early DSPN. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216715184,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

Mean ± SD HbA1c was 7.57% ± 0.97% at baseline and 7.62% ± 1.06% at 17 weeks in the TI group and 7.59% ± 0.80% and 7.54% ± 0.77%, respectively, in the UC group (adjusted difference 0.11%, 95% CI 20.10 to 0.33, P value for noninferiority = 0.01). HbA1c improved from baseline to 17 weeks by &gt;0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol) in 12 (21%) in the TI group and in 3 (5%) in the UC group and worsened by &gt;0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol) in 15 (26%) in the TI group and in 2 (3%) in the UC group. The most common TI side effect was a brief cough; eight participants discontinued TI due to side effects. Conclusions: In adults with type 1 diabetes, HbA1c after 17 weeks with a regimen of TI and degludec was noninferior to UC, which consisted predominately of either AID or MDI. TI should be considered an option for people with type 1 diabetes, particularly those who are motivated to further reduce postprandial hyperglycemia. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219495305,Basal (medicine)

Research design and methods: A cross-sectional analysis of 1,150 older adults with and without diabetes who attended the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (2021-2022). Diabetes was based on a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes by a health care provider, use of diabetes medication, or a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) =6.5%. Prediabetes was defined as an HbA1c of 5.7% to <6.5% and normoglycemia as an HbA1c of <5.7%. We analyzed CGM metrics, including mean glucose, measures of hyperglycemia, and the coefficient of variation, by diabetes status. Results: Of the 1,150 participants (mean age 83 years, 59% women, 26% who are Black), 35.1% had normoglycemia, 34.5% had prediabetes, and 30.4% had diabetes. The summary 24-h ambulatory glucose profile for participants with prediabetes was very similar to those with normoglycemia. No participants with normoglycemia or prediabetes had a CGM mean glucose >140 mg/dL, while 32.7% of participants with diabetes had a CGM mean glucose >140 mg/dL. Conclusions: In very old adults with normal or prediabetes HbA1c, hyperglycemia detected by CGM was rare. This suggests that HbA1c adequately captures the burden of hyperglycemia for most people in this population. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219496105,Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring

This study aimed to compare the performance of noninvasive tests (NITs) with that of two-step algorithms for detecting patients at high risk of AF requiring referral to hepatologists. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a planned interim analysis of a prospective multicenter study in cluding participants with type 2 diabetes and/or obesity and MASLD with com prehensive liver assessment comprising blood-based NITs, vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), and two-dimensional shear-wave elastography (2D-SWE). AF risk stratification was determined by a composite criterion of liver biopsy, magnetic resonance elastography, or VCTE $12 kPa depending on availability. RESULTS Of 654 patients (87% with type 2 diabetes, 56% male, 74% with obesity), 17.6% had an intermediate/high risk of AF, and 9.3% had a high risk of AF. The area under the empirical receiver operating characteristic curves of NITs for detection of high risk of AF were as follows: fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) score, 0.78 (95% CI 0.72–0.84); FibroMeter, 0.74 (0.66–0.83); FibroTest, 0.78 (0.72–0.85); Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test, 0.82 (0.76–0.87); and SWE, 0.84 (0.78–0.89). Algorithms with FIB-4 score/VCTE showed good diagnostic performance for referral of patients at intermediate/high risk of AF to specialized care in hepatology. An alternative FIB-4 score/ELF test strategy showed a high negative predictive value (NPV; 88–89%) and a lower positive predictive value (PPV; 39–46%) at a threshold of 9.8. The FIB-4 score/2D-SWE strategy had an NPV of 91% and a PPV of 58–62%. The age-adapted FIB-4 score threshold resulted in lower NPVsandPPVsinallalgorithms. CONCLUSIONS The FIB-4 score/VCTE algorithm showed excellent diagnostic performance, dem onstrating its applicability for routine screening in diabetology.The ELF test using an adapted low threshold at 9.8 may be used as an alternative to VCTE. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007949320,Transient elastography

However, PCSK9 inhibitors such as alirocumab lower both lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C without effect on NOD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a post hoc analysis of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial (NCT01663402), we examined the joint prediction of NOD by baseline lipoprotein(a), LDL-C, and insulin (or HO MA–insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) and their changes with alirocumab treatment. Analyses included 8,107 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome on optimized statin therapy, without diabetes at baseline, assigned to alirocumab or placebo with median follow-up 2.4 years. Splines were estimated from logistic regression models. RESULTS Lower baseline lipoprotein(a) and higher baseline insulin or HOMA-IR indepen dently predicted 782 cases of NOD; baseline LDL-C did not predict NOD. Aliro cumab reduced lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C without affecting insulin or NOD risk (odds ratio [OR] vs. placebo 0.998; 95%CI 0.860–1.158). However, in logistic re gression, decreased lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C on alirocumab were independent, opposite predictors of NOD. OR for NOD for 25% and 50%lipoprotein(a) reduc tionsonalirocumabwere1.12(95%CI1.01–1.23) and 1.24 (1.02–1.52). OR for NOD for 25% and 50% LDL-C reductions on alirocumab were 0.88 (95% CI 0.80–0.97) and 0.77 (0.64–0.94). CONCLUSIONS Baseline lipoprotein(a) was inversely associated with risk of NOD. Alirocumab induced reductions of lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C were associated with increased and decreased risk of NOD, respectively, without net effect on NOD. Ongoing trials will determine the impact of larger and longer lipoprotein(a) reductions on NOD. © 2025, American Diabetes Association Inc.

We aimed to explore the relationship between lung function impairment and risk of CVD and mortality within this high-risk population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This prospective study included 16,242 participants with T2D and free of CVD from the UK Biobank. Obstructive physiology (OP), restrictive physiology (RP), and preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm) were defined using spirometry, including forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards models and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate risks of CVD and all-cause mortality, respectively. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 13.9 years, 2,825 incident cases of CVD and 2,811 deaths were documented. Lower FEV1,FVC,FEV1/FVC ratio, FEV1 percent predicted, and FVC percent predicted were related to higher risks of CVD and all-cause mortality. Compared with preserved lung function, the adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD were 1.19 (95% CI 1.05–1.35) for OP and 1.47 (95% CI 1.33–1.65) for RP. Compared with the control group, the subdistribution HRs for CVD were 1.20 (95% CI 1.06–1.36) for OP and 1.43 (95% CI 1.29–1.59) for PRISm. These associations were consistent across subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Adding lung function measurements significantly enhanced the performance of CVD prediction beyond the SCORE2-Diabetes model.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS BP was measured up to nine (median six) times between 1986–1988 baseline and 2016–2018; n = 300 women and 304 men without CVD at baseline were followed until December 2020 for incidence of total CVD, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (CVD death, myocardial infarction [MI], or stroke), and hard coronary artery disease (hCAD) (CAD death, MI, or coronary revascularization/ blockage $ 50%). We estimated associations between time to event and longitudinal systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) by sex using joint models adjusted for time-varying longitudinal antihypertensive (AH) medication use, HbA1c, and overt nephropathy, baseline age, and other CVD risk factors. RESULTS Longitudinal SBP was 5.8 mmHg lower (P < 0.0001) and DBP 6.2 mmHg lower (P < 0.0001) in women versus men. Women had 20.3 mmHg/year faster DBP decline (P < 0.0001) despite similar AH rates by sex. Incidence of CVD was similar by sex. Each 5-mmHg increment in longitudinal SBP (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.23; 95% CI 1.04, 1.45) and DBP (HR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.20, 2.04) was associated with MACE in men only; DBP (HR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.05, 1.56) was associated with hCAD in women only. CONCLUSIONS BP was lower in women than men, and the strength of its association with the initial manifestation of CVD differed by sex. Further research into sex-specific BP mechanisms is needed to improve CVD risk reduction in people living with type 1 diabetes. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001434932,Mace; Stroke

This cross-sectional survey study aimed to 1) elucidate the associations between painful and painless DPN and QoL, mental health, and socioeconomic factors, 2) assess the prevalence of sensory pain descrip tors, and 3) evaluate the association between descriptors and the above factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were grouped into people with (n = 1,601) and without (n = 5,359) DPN based on the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire. Participants with DPN were subsequently divided into people with (n = 1,085) and without (n = 516) concomitant neuropathic pain based on the modified Dou leur Neuropathique en 4 Questions-interview. RESULTS The study showed diminished QoL (36-item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]: 55.1 [in terquartile range 36.7, 73.6], 82.2 [63.6, 90.9]) and poorer mental health (Hospital Anxi ety and Depression Scale, subscale for anxiety [HADS-A]: 5.00 [2, 9], 2.00 [1, 5]; HADS subscale for depression [HADS-D]: 4.00 [1, 8], 1.00 [0, 3]) in participants with DPN com pared with participants without DPN. The addition of pain diminished QoL (SF-36: 50.7 [34.8, 69.8]) and mental health (HADS-A: 6 [3, 10], HADS-D: 4 [1, 8]) further. The most prevalent pain descriptor in participants with painful DPN were burning pain (73%), while the most prevalent sensory descriptor was pins-and-needles (93%). An interesting f inding is the high prevalence of itch (44%). Weak associations with mental health and QoL were present for cold pain, electric pain, and itch.

We describe screening and monitoring outcomes 2 years after implementing in-home capillary blood spot sampling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data from 2,064 participants who registered between July 2022 and June 2024 were analyzed: 1,507 and 557 chose blood spot and venipuncture screening respectively. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes for 1,243 participants (967 blood spot and 276 venipuncture) whose samples were tested by June 2024. RESULTS One blood spot and five venous participants reported unsuccessful sample collections. The median (quartile 1, quartile 3) age of blood spot registrants was lower (12.1 [7.1, 27.1] vs. 17.2 [9, 38.4] years; P < 0.0001), and a higher proportion lived in regional Australia (39% vs. 29%; P = 0.0037). Among 72 participants (5.9%) with a positive screening test, 5 screened by blood spot and 2 by venipuncture had no autoantibodies on confirmatory testing. Blood spot screening identified the expected 2.1% prevalence of multiple autoantibodies and a 2.5% prevalence of a single autoantibody compared with 1.5% and 4.1%, respectively, for venipuncture screening. Clinical diabetes developed in 12 participants. All had screened positive and none had DKA. CONCLUSIONS Type1Screen has national reach. In-home blood spot screening is feasible, particularly for younger participants living regionally, and identifies the expected prevalence of preclinical T1D. The lower cost, increased convenience, and greater reach of blood spot screening could helpmeet increasing demand for early T1D diagnosis. © 2025, American Diabetes Association Inc.

We investigated the association between HbA1c and complications in individuals with diabetes and severe CKD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a Danish nationwide registry-based cohort study, we included 27,113 individuals ≥18 years old with diabetes and severe CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) between 2010 and 2022. As reference groups, we included an age-and sex-matched cohort of 80,131 individuals with diabetes and mild-to-moderate CKD (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) and 80,797 individuals with diabetes and no-to-mild CKD (eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ). Multiple Cox re-gressions were used to estimate the standardized 1-year risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), microvascular complications, and hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia across strata of HbA1c levels. RESULTS For individuals with severe CKD, the risk of MACE significantly increased at HbA1c levels ≥7.2% (55 mmol/mol) (P < 0.01) and <5.8% (40 mmol/mol) (P < 0.001), compared with an HbA1c level of 6.3–6.6% (45–49 mmol/mol). The risk of microvas-cular complications significantly increased at HbA1c levels ≥7.2% (55 mmol/mol) (P < 0.001), and the risk of hospitalization due to hypoglycemia significantly increased at HbA1c levels ≥6.7% (50 mmol/mol) (P < 0.001). The association patterns between HbA1c and outcomes were similar in the severe CKD cohort compared with the matched cohorts with mild-to-moderate CKD and no-to-mild CKD. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest an HbA1c range of 6.7–7.1% (50–54 mmol/mol) to be most fa-vorable for reducing long-term complications in this high-risk population. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012136383,Glycated hemoglobin; Mace

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a pooled cross-sectional analysis of 552 adults, ages 30–97 years old, with diabetes. Participants wore a CGM for up to 2 weeks, and we evaluated the agreement between blood biomarkers (glycated albumin, fructosamine, and 1,5-AG) with CGM-defined metrics of hyperglycemia and glycemic control. RESULTS Of the 552 participants (mean age 74 years, 53% women, 36% Black), the median of mean CGM glucose was 132 mg/dL, and participants spent on average 84% of their time in range (70–180 mg/dL). CGM mean glucose was strongly related to HbA1c (r = 0.72), glycated albumin (r = 0.64), and fructosamine (r = 0.64) but weakly related to 1,5-AG (r = 0.46). Results were similar for time above range (>180 mg/dL). Glycated albumin and fructosamine performed similarly to HbA1c in the detection of target time in and above range (c-statistics ranged from 0.85 to 0.94). CONCLUSIONS Glycated albumin and fructosamine had similar associations with CGM-defined metrics of hyperglycemia compared with HbA1c. These three biomarkers performed similarly in the detection of time above range and in range.

Mohan V.,Lessons Learned From Epidemiology of Type 2 Diabetes in South Asians: Kelly West Award Lecture 2024,2025,Diabetes Care,10.2337/dci24-0046,"South Asia has high prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Until the 1990s, the prevalence of T2D within South Asia was low but much higher in the South Asian diaspora living abroad. Today, high prevalence rates of T2D are reported among those living in South Asia. T2D in South Asians presents with unique clinical features described as the “South Asian phenotype” that include younger age at onset of diabetes than in White Europeans, much lower BMI, hyperinsulinemia and greater insulin resistance, rapid decline in b-cell function resulting in low insulin reserve, low muscle mass, and greater ectopic fat deposition, especially in the liver. Also, prevalence of impaired fasting glucose is higher among South Asians than prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance. Genetic predisposition combined with intrauterine fetal programming (low vitamin B12 intake and high folate intake) increases susceptibility to T2D, from birth. In later life, overnutrition, especially a high carbohydrate intake with refined grains of higher glycemic index, coupled with low physical activity likely triggers the T2D epidemic in South Asians. Additionally, there are emerging risk factors like air pollution. Preventing T2D in South Asians requires a multifactorial approach, including improvements in maternal and fetal nutrition with special reference to vitamin B12 and folate in-take, decreasing refined carbohydrate and increasing protein and fiber intake in the diet, increasing physical activity, and control of air pollution. Lessons learned from epidemiology of T2D in South Asians could be useful to other developing countries that are in earlier stages of epidemiological transition. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216607649,Overnutrition

With the availability of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and sodium–glucose co transporter 2 inhibitors, basal insulin (BI) therapy is no longer the first-line option after lifestyle modification plus oral agents is insufficient. In contrast to BI, the newer medications require minor titration, lower hyper glycemiain a glucose-dependent manner, and reduce body weight. Importantly, the newer agents reduce cardiorenal events in the short term. Nonetheless, insulin therapy continues to play a key role in control of hyper glycemia and therefore long-term prevention of vascular complications. Its use is essential in many circumstances, including metabolic emergencies, new diabetes onset, latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA), pregnancy, and when other agents are less desirable due to comorbidities. BI is needed in the frequent condition of failure of other therapies to keep HbA1cto target and/or intolerance of them. There are several advantages to the combination of BI with the newer medications given their different but complementary mechanisms of action, primarily, the lower dose of each, improving adherence and outcomes while decree sing the side effects. Multiple choices for single or combination use can better meet the variety of clinical phenotypes in the heterogeneous T2DM population, using the tenets of precision medicine. © 2025 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004237852,Basal (medicine)

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS | Nine young patients 18–25 years of age who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, living independently, or cohabiting with a partner were included. Relevant participants were invited by mail or telephone. Group interviews were conducted to uncover the specific knowledge requirements essential for improving their diabetes health literacy. Based on these interviews, four education sessions were held. RESULTS | The participants identified pertinent topics, including alcohol consumption, blood glucose control, educational and employment aspects, nutrition, sexuality, pregnancy, relationships, and interactions with health care pro-fessionals (HCPs). Notably, the participants expressed a preference for personalized interactions over information dissemination through digital platforms such as mobile applications. Building on this insight, we organized four sessions to provide education on the identified subjects. These sessions were designed to facilitate networking among participants and offer them the opportunity for discussion. Although invitations were extended to all individuals aged 18–25 years with type 1 diabetes (n = 52), only 13 patients and seven relatives participated. The feedback from attendees was overwhelmingly positive. Reasons for nonparticipation included forgetfulness or a reluctance to engage in group settings. CONCLUSION | Young people with type 1 diabetes appreciate personal contact with HCPs. They do not want to receive knowledge via digital apps and virtual media but instead to meet with equals. However, it remains difficult to involve them in social events. The problem of how to create contact with young people with type 1 diabetes to strengthen their health literacy remains unsolved, and there is a need for further innovative initiatives. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219678362,Health Literacy

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS | This open-label, cluster-randomized, controlled, multicenter pilot study involved three Austrian diabetes educational group courses. People with type 2 diabetes in the control group received a regular educational group course, whereas those in the intervention group received the same course plus the use of the DM2CUA app. The app prompted participants to carry out educational tasks that were discussed in the course. After the last les-son, the app provided participants with relevant messages for another 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire score assessed at four time points. Secondary outcome measures included scores on the Diabetes Distress Scale and the Health Education Impact Questionnaire and A1C levels. RESULTS | Participants in the intervention group already had a higher level of diabetes self-management at the start, but the median score showed further improvement during the entire study period.

Tschirhart H.; Ali M.U.; Yost J.; Nerenberg K.A.; Landeen J.; Sherifali D.,Prevalence and Correlates of Diabetes Distress in Pregnant Individuals With Preexisting Diabetes: A Cross-Sectional Study,2025,Diabetes Spectrum,10.2337/ds24-0014,"OBJECTIVE | Managing preexisting diabetes during pregnancy requires considerable self-management skills to achieve recommended glycemic targets and reduce fetal and obstetrical risks. Given the demands during this time, many individuals may experience diabetes distress. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of diabetes distress and associated clinical factors of diabetes distress during pregnancy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS | A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 36 pregnant participants with type 1 diabetes and 40 pregnant participants with type 2 diabetes. Assessments of diabetes distress, the primary outcome, were performed, along with assessments of depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, self-management, and patient care satisfaction. Linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine predictors of diabetes distress scores and positive diabetes distress. RESULTS | The prevalence of diabetes distress was 22.4%. Age 35 years of age and higher education levels were significantly associated with scores on the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) scale, which measures diabetes-related emotional distress (decreases of 10.18 and 11.77 points, respectively, P = 0.04). Living with others was associated with a reduction in PAID score by 21.56 points (P = 0.05) and the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness (PACIC) total score as well as PACIC Goal-Setting, and Problem-Solving/Contextual Counseling subscale scores were each associated with a decrease of ~4 points in PAID score (P <0.05). Having a common-law partner or spouse, comorbid depression, depressive symptoms, and depression scores were all significantly associated with increased PAID scores (P <0.05). CONCLUSION | The prevalence of diabetes distress in pregnancy is similar to estimates for nonpregnant adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, based on limited pregnancy literature. Further research is needed to establish diabetes distress rates using a validated tool for pregnancy to understand whether diabetes distress affects obstetrical and fetal outcomes and how diabetes distress levels can be alleviated in this population. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007080693,Cross-sectional study

We aimed to evaluate the safety and outcomes of NOSE following colorectal surgery in obese Asian patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection with NOSE for non-metastatic cancer or benign disease between February 2021 to October 2023. Clinical T4 or N2 disease on preoperative imaging were excluded from NOSE. Patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes were compared between patients with Body Mass Index (BMI) <25 kg/m2 versus BMI ≥25 kg/m2. RESULTS: Forty-nine consecutive patients underwent elective colorectal surgery with attempted NOSE over the 33-month study period. Forty patients (81.6%) had resection for a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Twenty-seven (55.1%) patients had BMI<25 kg/m2 and 22 (44.9%) had BMI≥25 kg/m2, with a median BMI of 22.1 kg/m2 and 27.8 kg/m2 in the lower and higher BMI cohorts respectively. Patient gender, albumin level, operative indication, and type of surgery performed were comparable. There were no statistical differences in the NOSE conduit used, operative duration, blood loss, postoperative gastrointestinal recovery time, and complication rates. Median postoperative length of stay was 3 days in either group. Two patients (9.1%) failed NOSE in the high BMI cohort. There were no open conversions. Amongst patients with colorectal cancer, distribution of pT and pN stages, total lymph node harvest, and tumour diameter were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal NOSE surgery amongst selected obese Asian patients results in similar perioperative outcomes and postoperative morbidity rates compared to non-obese patients.",,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012571417,Colorectal Surgery

This study aimed to assess the predictive value of preoperative vitamin D levels for postoperative complications and compare it with albumin levels, a known nutritional marker. The secondary objective was to identify cutoff values for both markers to identify at-risk patients for targeted nutritional interventions. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study included patients undergoing colorectal surgery between June 2023 and August 2024. Preoperative 25(OH)D, albumin, and other nutritional markers (blood glucose, folate, vitamin B12) were measured during a nutritional assessment one month before surgery. These markers were analyzed in relation to postoperative complications. RESULTS: Lower preoperative levels of both 25(OH)D and albumin were significantly associated with postoperative complications (P=0.039 and P=0.012, respectively). Univariate analysis identified ASA score, folate, 25(OH)D, and albumin as predictors, with multivariate analysis confirming albumin (P=0.044) as significant, while 25(OH)D showed a trend (P=0.086). Optimal cutoff values were 14.4 ng/mL for 25(OH)D and 3.6 g/dL for albumin. CONCLUSIONS: Lower 25(OH)D and albumin levels were associated with postoperative complications.

Louvel G.; Roest Crollius H.,Factors influencing the accuracy and precision in dating single gene trees,2025,Peer Community Journal,10.24072/pcjournal.556,"Molecular dating is the inference of divergence time from genetic sequences. Knowing the time of appearance of a taxon sets the evolutionary context by connecting it with past ecosystems and species. Knowing the divergence times of gene lineages would provide a context to understand adaptation at the genomic level. However, molecular clock inference faces uncertainty due to the variability of the rate of substitution between species, between genes, and between sites within genes. When dating speciations, per-lineage rate variability can be informed by fossil calibrations, and gene-specific rates can be either averaged out or modeled by concatenating multiple genes. By contrast, when dating genespecific events, fossil calibrations only inform about speciation nodes, and concatenation does not apply to divergences other than speciations. This study aims to benchmark the accuracy of molecular dating applied to single gene trees and identify how it is affected by gene tree characteristics. We analyze 5205 alignments of genes from 21 Primates in which no duplication or loss is observed. We also simulated alignments based on characteristics from Primates under a relaxed clock model to analyze the dating accuracy. Divergence times were estimated with the Bayesian program Beast2. From the empirical dataset, we find that the date estimates deviate more from the median age with shorter alignments, high rate heterogeneity between branches, and low average rate, features that underlie the amount of dating information in alignments, hence, statistical power. The smallest deviation is associated with core biological functions such as ATP binding and cellular organization, categories that are expected to be under strong negative selection. We then investigated the accuracy of dating with simulated alignments, by controlling the three above parameters separately. It confirmed the factors of precision, but also revealed biases when branch rates are highly heterogeneous. This suggests that in the case of the relaxed uncorrelated molecular clock, biases arise from the tree prior when calibrations are lacking and rate heterogeneity is high. Our study finally reports the scale of the gene tree features that influence the dating consistency with median ages, so that comparisons can be made with other genes and taxa. To tackle the molecular dating of events only observed in single gene trees, like deep coalescence, horizontal gene transfers, and gene duplications, future models should overcome the lack of power due to limited information from single genes. © 2025, Centre Mersenne.

However, the role of serum albumin in mortality among elderly patients with chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to assess the relationship between serum albumin levels and mortality in this specific patient population. METHODS Our analysis included 873 elderly AR patients from the China Valvular Heart Disease study, with baseline serum albumin measured at enrollment. Mortality outcomes were monitored for two years post-enrollment, employing a Cox proportional hazards model with a two-piecewise Cox proportional hazards framework to investigate the nonlinear relationship between serum albumin levels and all-cause mortality. RESULTS During the 2-year follow-up period, we observed 63 all-cause deaths. The association between serum albumin levels and all-cause mortality displayed an approximating L-shaped curve, indicating a mortality threshold at 35 g/L. For serum albumin levels below 35 g/L, each 1 g/L decrease was associated with a 25% higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.07–1.45). In contrast, no significant change in mortality risk was observed when serum albumin levels were greater than or equal to 35 g/L. Moreover, when serum albumin is classified as hypoproteinemia (serum albumin < 35 g/L), the higher risks of all-cause death were observed in hypoproteinemic patients (HR = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.50–5.74). More importantly, the association between serum albumin and death was significantly stronger in overweight/obese patients (≥ 24 kg/m2 vs. < 24 kg/m2, Pinteraction = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS In elderly patients with AR, serum albumin levels showed an approximating L-shaped relationship with all-cause death, with thresholds of 35 g/L. Body mass index was significant effect modifiers of the association. These results suggest that serum albumin, as an inexpensive and readily available biochemical marker, may further improve the stratified risk of mortality in older AR patients. © 2025 JGC All rights reserved.",,Final,All Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004659796,Serum Albumin
Trzebiatowski L.; Georgiev P.; Büttner K.; Wehrend A.,Influence of different processing methods on anti-trypsin activity in bovine colostrum,2025,JDS Communications,10.3168/jdsc.2024-0678,"Colostrum is important for supplying the bovine neonate with nutrients, bioactive substances, and immunoglobulins to acquire passive immunity. Trypsin inhibitory activity represents a general characteristic of the first bovine colostrum. It is assumed that the anti-trypsin activity serves to protect bioactive molecules in the colostrum from being digested by the calf. The objectives of the study were to establish a test to determine anti-trypsin activity and test the hypothesis that freezing, acidification, and heat treatment alter anti-trypsin activity compared with untreated bovine colostrum. A photometric assay was established to determine anti-trypsin activity. The activity was expressed in milligrams of inhibited trypsin per milliliter of colostrum. Anti-trypsin activity was measured in untreated colostrum, frozen colostrum (−20°C for 24 h), colostrum acidified using 10% formic acid in a way that it was present as 1% in the sample, and colostrum heat treated according to 2 different protocols (60°C for 60 min and 63.5°C for 30 min). In our study, trypsin inhibition in 40 untreated colostrum samples (0.80 mg/mL, SEM 0.03) corresponded to that observed in frozen colostrum samples (0.79 mg/mL, SEM 0.03). In these first analyzed 40 and 59 extra samples (in total 99 samples), the anti-trypsin activity of frozen colostrum (0.85 mg/mL, SEM 0.01) was compared with colostrum subjected to acidification (0.84 mg/mL, SEM 0.01), heat treatment at 60°C for 60 min (0.65 mg/mL, SEM 0.02), and heat treatment at 63.5°C for 30 min (0.61 mg/mL, SEM 0.02). Acidification did not significantly affect trypsin inhibition. Both heat treatment protocols significantly reduced anti-trypsin activity. In the future, when investigating the effects of postharvest storage and processing on bovine colostrum, the influence on anti-trypsin activity should be evaluated in addition to the effects on immunoglobulins and other components. © 2025",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003920165,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

The system includes a combination of real-time continuous glucose monitoring from a continuous glucose monitoring device and a control algorithm to direct insulin delivery through an insulin pump. Evidence suggests that such technologies have the potential to improve the lives of people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and their families. Aim: The aim of this appraisal was to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hybrid closed-loop systems for managing glucose in people who have type 1 diabetes mellitus and are having difficulty managing their condition despite prior use of at least one of the following technologies: continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, real-time continuous glucose monitoring or flash glucose monitoring (intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring). Methods: A systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evidence following predefined inclusion criteria informed by the aim of this review. An independent economic assessment using iQVIA CDM to model cost-effectiveness. Results: The clinical evidence identified 12 randomised controlled trials that compared hybrid closed loop with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion + continuous glucose monitoring. Hybrid closed-loop arm of randomised controlled trials achieved improvement in glycated haemoglobin per cent [hybrid closed loop decreased glycated haemoglobin per cent by 0.28 (95% confidence interval −0.34 to −0.21), increased per cent of time in range (between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/l) with a MD of 8.6 (95% confidence interval 7.03 to 10.22), and significantly decreased time in range (per cent above 10.0 mmol/l) with a MD of −7.2 (95% confidence interval −8.89 to −5.51), but did not significantly affect per cent of time below range (< 3.9 mmol/l)]. Comparator arms showed improvements, but these were smaller than in the hybrid closed-loop arm. Outcomes were superior in the hybrid closed-loop arm compared with the comparator arm. The cost-effectiveness search identified six studies that were included in the systematic review. Studies reported subjective cost-effectiveness that was influenced by the willingness-to-pay thresholds. Economic evaluation showed that the published model validation papers suggest that an earlier version of the iQVIA CDM tended to overestimate the incidences of the complications of diabetes, this being particularly important for severe visual loss and end-stage renal disease. Overall survival’s medium-term modelling appeared good, but there was uncertainty about its longer-term modelling. Costs provided by the National Health Service Supply Chain suggest that hybrid closed loop is around an annual average of £1500 more expensive than continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion + continuous glucose monitoring, this being a pooled comparator of 90% continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion + intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring and 10% continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion + real-time continuous glucose monitoring due to clinical effectiveness estimates not being differentiated by continuous glucose monitoring type. This net cost may increase by around a further £500 for some systems. The Evidence Assessment Group base case applies the estimate of −0.29% glycated haemoglobin for hybrid closed loop relative to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion + continuous glucose monitoring. There was no direct evidence of an effect on symptomatic or severe hypoglycaemia events, and therefore the Evidence Assessment Group does not include these in its base case. The change in glycated haemoglobin results in a gain in undiscounted life expectancy of 0.458 years and a gain of 0.160 quality-adjusted life-years. Net lifetime treatment costs are £31,185, with reduced complications leading to a net total cost of £28,628. The cost-effectiveness estimate is £179,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Conclusions: Randomised controlled trials of hybrid closed-loop interventions in comparison with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion + continuous glucose monitoring achieved a statistically significant improvement in glycated haemoglobin per cent in time in range between 3.9 and 10 mmol/l, and in hyperglycaemic levels. © 2024 Asgharzadeh et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212797783,Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Glycated hemoglobin

Cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurologic syndrome are extensively characterized. However, limited data exist on the burden, predictors, and implications of acute kidney injury (AKI) after CAR T-cell therapy. On initial screening of the Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system, we identified a disproportionately high rate of renal adverse events among nearly 6,000 CAR T adverse event reports, suggesting it is clinically important in this patient population. In a subsequent single-center analysis of 399 NHL patients treated with CD19 CAR T cells, we found a substantial burden of AKI after CAR T infusion (10% and 5% of any grade and grade ≥2 AKI) with pre-renal causes being predominant (72%). Evolution to chronic kidney disease was rare, however, three patients required hemodialysis. Importantly, patients experiencing cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity as well as those with low serum albumin and high inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-α, were more likely to develop AKI. While pre-CAR T renal dysfunction was not associated with adverse outcomes, patients developing post-CAR T AKI had lower overall survival compared to their counterparts. Our findings indicate that renal dysfunction is a common toxicity of CAR T-cell therapy with meaningful prognostic impact. Notably, the link between systemic inflammation and renal dysfunction, suggests that readily available biomarkers may inform on renal injury risk after CAR T-cell therapy. ©2025 Ferrata Storti Foundation.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000606330,Cytokine Release Syndrome

Moreover, innovation in VWD therapeutic strategies has essentially stalled, and available treatments have remained unchanged for decades. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies for VWD patients, especially for the large portion of those with VWD-type 1. Due to species differences, the available VWD murine models are not suitable for preclinical studies, making it difficult to test new therapeutic approaches in vivo. With this in mind, we generated mice selectively expressing human von Willebrand factor (VWF) and human GPIba. Because this fully humanized model was found to express low VWF (12%) and factor VIII (FVIII) (40%) levels with normal multimer profile and activity/antigen ratio, we repositioned it as a VWD-type 1 model (hVWD1 mice). In depth characterization of this model confirmed VWD-type 1 features with a decrease in platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in vitro. In vivo, a moderate bleeding phenotype was observed which was corrected upon the administration of recombinant-VWF or upon histamine-induced release of endothelial VWF. In search of new therapeutic options for VWD, we designed a bispecific single-domain antibody that bridges VWF to albumin (KB-V13A12). Remarkably, a single subcutaneous administration of KB-V13A12 coincided with a sustained 2-fold increase in VWF antigen levels for up to ten days and normalized hemostasis in a tail-clip model in hVWD1 mice. Here, we describe the development of our unique humanized mouse model for VWD-type 1 and a promising new therapeutic that corrected hemostasis in these mice. ©2025 Ferrata Storti Foundation.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001636967,Humanized mouse; von Willebrand Disease

Traditional noninvasive diagnostic tools that are currently used in the clinic, such as creatinine and cystatin C–based eGFR measurements, urinalysis, urine sediment examination, urine protein quantification, and urine electrolyte measurement, lack the sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between the various underlying etiologies of AKI in patients with cancer. Imaging-based diagnostics can be helpful to rule out urinary obstruction, but also lack sensitivity and specificity to diagnose the etiology of AKI. Kidney biopsy is often required for definitive diagnosis. As our scientific understanding of the biological pathways that are dysregulated in AKI has advanced, there has been considerable interest in developing new biomarkers for AKI. For example, the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis, which can occur in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, promises to be revolutionized by the incorporation of urinary testing for inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-X-C motif ligand 9, TNF-a, and IL-9. In the case of cisplatin administration, biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 may improve prognostication, differentiating between persistent AKI resulting from acute tubular injury versus prerenal azotemia. The development and validation of blood, urine, and imaging biomarkers into widely used diagnostic tests will require a concerted effort, but could improve diagnosis, management, and prognostication for a growing group of patients who are at high risk of developing AKI during the course of their illness. © 2024 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210294968,Acute tubular necrosis; Kidney cancer

Lymphatic vessels are important in modulating inflammation postinjury. Manipulating lymphatic vessel expansion thus has the potential to alter CKD progression. Previously, we demonstrated that renal lymphatic expansion before injury reduced CKD progression after an AKI. Here, we test whether inducing lymphangiogenesis affects established CKD. Methods After CKD progression, kidney lymphatics were expanded by transgenic induction of kidney-specific overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor-D in aristolochic acid (AA) nephropathy and cisplatin injury aggravated with chronic high phosphate diet (CisPi) models or by infusion of kidney-targeting nanoparticles loaded with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 specific ligand vascular endothelial growth factor-C C156S in a progressive proteinuria (POD) model. Renal fibrosis and lymphatic density were determined by picrosirius red staining and immunofluorescence, respectively. Renal function was assessed by creatinine clearance rate, serum creatinine, BUN, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio. Renal proinflammatory and fibrotic markers expression were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Results Kidney-specific overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor-D1 mice demonstrated expanded renal lymphatics, while nanoparticles treatment minimally expanded lymphatics. In neither the AA nor POD model did lymphangiogenesis improve renal function or fibrosis. AA mice showed decreased Tgfb1 expression and POD mice showed increased Col4a1 expression. Expansion worsened function in CisPi CKD and increased fibrosis. CisPi kidneys also demonstrated increased expression of Mcp-1, Il1b, Col1a1, and Tgfb1 and increased macrophage numbers. Conclusions Therapeutically induced lymphatic expansion is ineffective in resolving established CKD and has the potential to further worsen CKD progression. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Johnson A.C.M.; Zager R.A.,"Veverimer, a Nonabsorbed Gastrointestinal Tract HCl Binder, Decreases Renal Ammoniagenesis and Mitigates Nephrotoxic Serum Nephritis",2025,Kidney360,10.34067/KID.0000000743,"Background Increased tubular ammoniagenesis is an adaptive response to progressive kidney disease, facilitating net acid excretion. However, excess ammonia production can also exacerbate kidney disease progression, in part, by activating the alternative complement cascade. Oral Na bicarbonate therapy can decrease the systemic H1 burden, limiting ammonia production. However, poor compliance limits bicarbonate's efficacy. Veverimer is an oral, Na1-free, nonabsorbed polymer that binds H1 within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This stimulates GI carbonic anhydrase-mediated bicarbonate production and systemic bicarbonate uptake. Hence, the goals of this study were to test whether GI HCl binding decreases renal tubular ammoniagenesis, to assess whether complement activation decreases, and to determine whether these changes can mitigate nephrotoxic serum (NTS) nephritis, in which complement activation may play a role. Methods A normal diet6 veverimer (4.5% w/w) was fed to normal mice for approximately 1 week. Veverimer's effect on plasma bicarbonate; blood/urinary pH; urinary ammonia excretion; and tubular H1 transporter, NHE3, density was assessed. Additional mice were fed the normal or veverimer diet after NTS injection. Urine protein, albumin, ammonia, C5b-9 excretion, and plasma C3a levels were measured 1 week and/or 2 weeks after NTS injection. Renal histologic changes (hematoxylin and eosin stain; C5b-9, CD45 immunohistochemistry), and selected injury mediators/biomarkers (NGAL, IL-6, MCP-1, TGFb1, and endothelin-1 mRNAs) were also assessed. Results Veverimer increased plasma bicarbonate/urinary pH, reduced urinary ammonia, and decreased NHE3 in normal mice. Veverimer also reduced NTS-induced proteinuria/albuminuria, urinary ammonia, and C5b-9 excretion (by approximately 60%, 75%, and 50%, respectively). Significant reductions in NTS-induced glomerular/tubulointerstitial injury, inflammatory/profibrotic gene expression, renal C5b-9 deposition, and suppressed plasma C3a levels were observed. Oral bicarbonate also conferred protection, implicating bicarbonate's role in veverimer's beneficial effect. Conclusions Veverimer-mediated bicarbonate generation can suppress renal ammoniagenesis and complement activation. These findings suggest a potential benefit of veverimer/bicarbonate therapy in selected complement-mediated kidney diseases.

In vitro investigations used Beas2B cells to assess the biocompatibility of isoprenaline, PEI–isoprenaline, and small interfering RNA (siRNA)/PEI–isoprenaline complexes, with cytotoxicity evaluations confirming their safety. The transfection efficiency of the siRNA/PEI–isoprenaline complex was scrutinized in THP-1 cells and displayed superior performance in delivering siRNA to cells expressing the β2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2). Invivo studies used a murine chronic asthma model to evaluate gene delivery to ADRB2-expressing cells in bronchoalveolar fluid and lung tissues.Therapeutic effects were comprehensively assessed through cell analyses, revealing substantial reductions in airway inflammatory cells and fibrosis, particularly in the Arg1 siRNA/PEI–isoprenaline group.The siRNA/PEI–isoprenaline complex exhibited an impressive 80% delivery rate, greatly surpassing the performance of polyethyleneimine 2K (20%). Notably, the complex achieved a substantial 63% reduction in arginase-1 gene expression, validating its therapeutic potential. Noteworthy inhibitory effects on airway hyperresponsiveness were observed, underscoring the complex’s potential as a targeted gene delivery system for asthma treatment. Our findings underscore the promise and effectiveness of the PEI–isoprenaline complex as a gene delivery system, with its demonstrated biocompatibility, transfection efficiency, and therapeutic outcomes, including arginase-1 gene knockdown and mitigation of airway inflammation and fibrosis, indicating it as a promising candidate for advancing asthma therapy and contributing to the understanding and control of airway remodeling in respiratory diseases.

Scaffolds that can fill defects and facilitate bone regeneration have garnered considerable attention. However, scaffolds struggle to provide an ideal microenvironment for cell growth and differentiation at the interior of the bone defect sites. The scaffold’s structure must meet specific requirements to support endogenous bone regeneration. Here, we introduce a novel 3D-printed nanocolloidal gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel, namely, the nG hydrogel, that was derived from the self-assembly of GelMA in the presence of Pluronics F68, emphasizing its osteoinductive capability conferred solely by the specific nanocolloidal structure. The nG hydrogel, exhibiting remarkable pore connectivity and cell-adaptable microscopic structure, induced the infiltration and migration of rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) into the hydrogel with a large spreading area in vitro. Moreover, the nG hydrogel with interconnected nanospheres promoted the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs, leading to up-regulated expression of ALP, RUNX2, COL-1, and OCN, as well as augmented formation of calcium nodules. In the critical-sized rat calvarial defect model, the nG hydrogel demonstrated improved repair of bone defects, with enhanced recruitment of endogenous CD29+ and CD90+ stem cells and increased bone regeneration, as indicated by significantly higher bone mineral density (BMD) in vivo. Mechanistically, the integrin β1/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mechanotransduction signaling pathway was up-regulated in the nG hydrogel group both in vitro and in vivo, which may partially account for its pronounced osteoinductive capability. In conclusion, the cell-adaptable nG hydrogel shows great potential as a near-future clinical translational strategy for the customized repair of critical-sized bone defects.

Many studies have used mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to treat OA, but MSC treatment remains challenging for clinical application owing to MSC quality control, engraftment, and fibrocartilage regeneration. Here, rather than relying on the direct regeneration of MSCs, we present a novel strategy to suppress OA by MSC-mediated senescent chondrocyte targeting via the paracrine activity of MSCs, thereby improving the knee microenvironment. First, to enable quality control of umbilical cord MSCs, priming MSCs by supplementing human platelet lysate (hPL) greatly enhanced MSC functions by increasing cellular glutathione levels throughout serial passaging. Intra-articular injection of primed MSCs successfully suppressed OA progression and senescent chondrocyte accumulation without direct regeneration. Indirect coculture with primed MSCs using transwell ameliorated the senescence phenotypes in OA chondrocytes, suggesting paracrine rejuvenation. Based on secretome analysis, we identified insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) as a key component that induces paracrine rejuvenation by primed MSCs. The rejuvenation effects of IGF2 act through autophagy activation through the up-regulation of autophagy-related gene expression and autophagic flux. To cross-validate the effects of secreted IGF2 invivo, knockdown of IGF2 in primed MSCs substantially abolished its therapeutic efficacy in a rabbit OA model. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that hPL supplementation enables MSC quality control by increasing MSC glutathione levels. The therapeutic mechanism of primed MSCs was secreted IGF2, which induces paracrine rejuvenation of senescent OA chondrocytes by activating autophagy.

Disulfiram, historically employed for the treatment of chronic alcoholism, has recently emerged as a promising antitumor agent in combination with Cu2+. However, reported disulfiram–Cu2+ codelivery regimens often suffer from instability as well as inadequate drug metabolism, which is detrimental to the production and action of the antitumor active ingredient copper(II) bis(diethyldithiocarbamate). To address this obstacle, this study tested nanosystems ICG-CuET@PLGA-CS-HA (IC@PCH) nanoparticles (NPs) carrying the chemotherapeutic agent copper(II) bis(diethyldithiocarbamate) and photosensitizer indocyanine green for the efficient delivery of antitumor drugs. Benefiting from the involvement of hyaluronic acid, the prepared IC@PCH NPs not only targeted CD44 on the surface of tumor cells but also showed a longer in vivo circulation time. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that IC@PCH NP-mediated photothermal-chemotherapy treatment led to pyroptosis via the NLRP3/caspase-1 classical pathway, which had a significant therapeutic effect on triple-negative breast cancer. In addition, targeting IC@PCH NPs allows photoacoustic–magnetic resonance–fluorescence trimodal imaging, which is capable of detecting more insidious cancer foci and opens up new avenues for precise cancer diagnosis and treatment.

However, its relationship with gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Multiple online bioinformatic tools were used to evaluate the messenger (m)RNA expression levels of SH3BGRL3 in GC using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry were performed to assess SH3BGRL3 expression in relation to clinicopathological parameters and outcomes in patients with GC. Significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of SH3BGRL3 were enriched and visualized. Furthermore, associations between the expression of SH3BGRL3 and the infiltration of immune cells were explored. SH3BGRL3 exhibited aberrant expression in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues at the mRNA and protein expression levels, especially in Epstein-Barr virus-negative GC (EBVnGC). Higher SH3BGRL3 expression was significantly associated with increasing tumor-node-metastasis staging, tumor budding, perineural invasion, EGFR expression, and a notably higher preoperative blood glucose concentration in clinical specimens. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher SH3BGRL3 expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor for the overall survival of patients with EBVnGC (hazard ratio, 1.666; P=0.018). Furthermore, the stratified analysis revealed that the SH3BGRL3 phenotype could help to refine prognosis in patients. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.740 when combining SH3BGRL3 with other clinicopathological parameters, which indicated a good model for clinical follow-up decisions. Gene functional enrichment analysis also revealed that the DEGs of SH3BGRL3 were mainly enriched in regulating ATP metabolism, ATP synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain in GC. Moreover, a higher SH3BGRL3 expression was significantly positively correlated with the infiltrating macrophages in GC. In conclusion, SH3BGRL3 is upregulated in GC, particularly in EBVnGC. Higher SH3BGRL3 expression is closely associated with hyperglycemia and poor outcomes in patients with EBVnGC, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and prognostic predictor.  © 2024 Li et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209723771,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We studied the oncological outcomes and complications in patients who underwent radical cystectomy (RC) with or without NAC. Methods: A retrospective review of patients who underwent RC with or without NAC from June 2009 to June 2020 was conducted. Oncological outcomes, overall survival (OS) and recurrence‑free survival (RFS), complications, and prognostic factors were analyzed. Results: Of the 314 patients who underwent RC, 83 patients received NAC (Group A), and 231 underwent RC alone (Group B). The median age was 58 years. The median follow‑up duration was 22 (3–64) and 24 (3–62) months, respectively. The median OS in Group A was significantly higher than Group B (38 months [confidence interval (CI): 34–42] and 32 [CI: 29–35], respectively, [P = 0.033]). The RFS in Groups A and B was 34 (CI: 30–39) and 31 (CI: 28–34) months, respectively (P = 0.47). Higher pathological T stage (T3/4), node positivity and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were predictors of poor OS and RFS (P < 0.0001). Clavien grades 3/4 complications were comparable (8% vs. 15%; P = 0.19). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was associated with higher postoperative complications in both groups (P = 0.012). Conclusion: The OS with NAC was superior to upfront RC. RFS was, however, comparable. NAC was safe and well‑tolerated. Pathologically, higher T stage, node positivity, and LVI were associated with poorer OS and RFS. Low GFR negatively influenced postoperative complications. © 2025 Indian Journal of Urology.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215840109,Center (category theory); Neoadjuvant Therapy; Single Center

Liver dysfunction is a key determinant of the pathogenesis and resolution of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which affects the prognosis of patients. Aims: To evaluate the association of PALBI grade with the risk of 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between PALBI grade and the 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS; results were described as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This association was further assessed by subgroup analyses stratified based on age, sex, and complications. Results: A total of 2,841 patients with ARDS were included, of whom, 703 (24.74%) died within 30 days. After adjusting all covariates, a higher PALBI grade was associated with higher odds of 30-day mortality (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.05-2.29). High PALBI grade was related to higher odds of 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS aged ≥ 65 years (HR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.06-5.01), males (HR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.29-3.44), without sepsis (HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.11-2.64), without pneumonia (HR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.19-2.91), and without any history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.28-2.91). Conclusion: The PALBI grade was positively associated with 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS.

Aims: To assess ways in which PBUTs alter the CYP450 enzymes in hepatocytes as well as the possible effects of specific PBUTs on the metabolism and excretion of atorvastatin (ATV). Study Design: An experimental study. Methods: The experimental group was treated with long-term MHD for > 3 months, estimated-glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) < 15 ml/ min, normal Alb level (35.0-55.0 g/l), and no urine; the control group was not treated with hemodialysis, e-GFR < 60 ml/min, normal Alb level, and normal urinary excretion function. A suitable UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for detecting the concentration of 4-hydroxy ATV. Fresh primary hepatocytes were isolated from rats, and the uptake of ATV was tested in the uremic serum (US) group, IS group, and HA group and compared with that in the normal serum group. The metabolic status of ATV in the US group, IS group, and HA group was compared with that in the ATV group. RLM were extracted, and the metabolic experiment of ATV was performed in a human CYP3A4 model. The influence of UTs on pregnane X receptor (PXR)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) mRNA and the protein expression was also detected. Results: IS and HA inhibited the ATV metabolism to varying degrees, wherein IS was the most potent inhibitor, producing > 50% inhibition. Meanwhile, the protein expression of CYP3A4 was downregulated after incubation with US, IS, and HA (p < 0.01). The excretion of ATV was also inhibited by 59.24% and 71.95% after incubation with IS and HA, respectively. The effects of uremic toxins on PXR/NF-κB mRNA and protein expression elucidated that PBUTs can inhibit ATV uptake and metabolism by exerting inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 through the PXR/ NF-κB signaling pathway. Conclusion: ATV metabolism could be significantly altered in the presence of uremic toxins, suggesting a downregulated effect on the ATV uptake, possibly through Oatp1b1, and also on the activity of CYP3A4 through the PXR/NF-κB signaling pathway. © @ Author(s).",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214764044,Disposition; Uremic Toxins

Li A.; Zhang Y.; Zhang X.; Duan Z.; Chen Y.; Jiang X.; Deng W.,Predictive Factors and Nomogram for 30-Day Mortality in Heatstroke Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2025,Western Journal of Emergency Medicine,10.5811/westjem.23666,"Objective: Heatstroke (HS) is a severe condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In this study we aimed to identify early risk factors that impacted the 30-day mortality of HS patients and establish a predictive model to assist clinicians in identifying the risk of death. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, analyzing the clinical data of 203 HS patients between May 2016–September 2024. The patients were divided into two groups: those who had died within 30 days of symptom onset; and those who had survived. We analyzed the risk factors affecting 30-day mortality. A nomogram was drawn to visualize the clinical model. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curve to verify the accuracy of the nomogram. A decision curve analysis was also performed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the nomogram. Results: Within a 30-day period, 57 patients (28.08%) died. The APACHE II score, the ratio of lactate-to-albumin (LAR), and the core temperature at 30 minutes after admission were independent risk factors for death of HS patients at 30 days. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for predicting mortality based on the APACHE II score was 0.867, with a sensitivity of 96.5% and a specificity of 61.6%. Moreover, the AUC for predicting mortality based on the LAR was 0.874, with a sensitivity of 93.0% and a specificity of 77.4%. The AUC based on the core temperature at 30 minutes after admission was 0.774, with a sensitivity of 70.2% and a specificity of 78.8%. Finally, the AUC for predicting death due to HS using the combination of these three factors was 0.928, with a sensitivity of 82.5% and a specificity of 91.8%. The calibration curve and the decision-curve analysis showed that the new nomogram had better accuracy and potential application value in predicting the prognosis of HS patients. Conclusion: A nomogram with these three indicators in combination—APACHE II score, lactate-to-albumin ratio, and core temperature at 30 minutes after admission—can be used to predict 30-day mortality of heatstroke patients. © 2025 Li et al.",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008023203,Heatstroke; Nomogram

We sought to understand 1) the interests and preferences of racial and ethnic minority men, with or at risk for type 2 diabetes, in programs designed to improve health and 2) factors that influence participation and health practices. Methods We designed a 43-question web-based survey on facilitators and barriers to participation in a healthy living program. The survey was administered from August 27, 2019, through September 3, 2019. Our analytic sample consisted of 1,506 men at risk for or diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in racial and ethnic minority groups. We conducted descriptive and regression analyses of survey data. Results Most men (59%) were interested in participating in a healthy living program and/or program elements such as incentives (67%), male-specific health topics (57%), and the inclusion of family (63%). Flexibility was important, since “exercising when it is convenient for me” was the most frequently selected facilitator of physical activity and “the hours were inconvenient” was identified as a challenge in previous programs. Men in this survey were significantly more likely to be interested in participating in a health improvement program for several reasons, including if they were physically active 150 minutes or more per week (vs not) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6–3.0) and had previously been in a healthy living program (vs not) (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.1). Conclusion Our findings can be useful for recruiting and retaining racial and ethnic minority men with or at risk for type 2 diabetes in programs designed to improve health and ultimately reduce disparities in the prevalence of diabetes. © (2025), (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)).

Johnson S.S.; Castle P.H.; Bosack S.,"Leveraging Technology and Theory to Change Health Behaviors, Close Gaps in Health-Related Social Needs, and Increase Enrollment in the National Diabetes Prevention Program",2025,Preventing Chronic Disease,10.5888/PCD22.240284,"Purpose and Objectives Although progress has been made in scaling up the National Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Change Program (National DPP LCP), innovative engagement strategies are needed. Intervention Approach This implementation evaluation leveraged and combined technology, behavior change theory, and community-based participatory design approaches to develop, deploy, and evaluate a 6-month, bilingual, tailored text message-delivered program (bRIght communities) to increase 1) readiness to engage in key behaviors for diabetes prevention, 2) engagement in services that address health-related social needs to reduce barriers to participation, and 3) readiness to enroll in the National DPP LCP. Evaluation Methods We implemented a statewide, multichannel recruitment strategy from May through October 2022 and recruited 432 community members (62.3% White, 26.0% Hispanic, 6.2% Black) who received up to 6 months of tailored text messages. Six months postenrollment, 273 participants completed an online follow-up survey. Among those who did not complete the survey, responses from the last texting session were used for pre/post comparisons. Results Matched pre/post analyses (using t tests and McNemar tests) indicated that bRIght communities had a significant impact on daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (d = 0.43); weekly physical activity minutes (d = 0.48); resilience (d = 0.26); food insecurity (P < .001); transportation concerns (P < .001); and perceptions of feeling unsafe exercising in one’s neighborhood (P < .001). Nearly 68% of participants with or at risk for prediabetes were in the pre-contemplation stage for enrolling in the National DPP. Overall, 30.3% of participants in bRIght communities moved forward at least 1 stage of change. Implications for Public Health Interactive, theoretically driven tailored text messaging represents a promising approach to increasing awareness of prediabetes risk, readiness to enroll in the National DPP LCP, participant engagement, and health behavior change. Providing links to existing geographically matched community resources reduced health-related social needs that can present barriers to participating in the National DPP LCP. The results also provide insights to inform the design and development of other population-based tailored text-delivered interventions. © (2025), (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)).

Tian F.; Chen Z.; Zhang Y.; Feng Q.; Chen X.,Impact of Chinese criteria on potentially inappropriate medication use in China,2025,Journal of Global Health,10.7189/JOGH.15.04063,"Background In 2018, China issued a set of criteria for effectively identifying and managing potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use in older adults. However, there is currently a lack of evidence regarding the impact of these criteria on PIM use among older Chinese adults. Methods We used interrupted time series analysis on the prescription data of older outpatients from 59 hospitals in six major geographic regions of China to compare changes in the overall prevalence of PIM use, the prevalence of PIM use stratified by different numbers of PIMs, and the prevalence of top five PIMs (i.e. clopidogrel, estazolam, zolpidem, sliding-scale insulin, and alprazolam) from 2015 (before) to 2021 (after) the release of criteria in 2018. Results We included 982605 older outpatients. Compared with trends prior to the publication of the criteria, there were significant decreases in the coefficient for change in the slope of the overall prevalence of PIM use (β = −0.607; 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.881, −0.482; P < 0.001), the prevalence of single PIM use (β = −0.368; 95% CI = −0.465, −0.272; P < 0.001), the prevalence of multiple PIM use (β = −0.104; 95% CI = −0.173, −0.080; P = 0.019), the prevalence of clopidogrel (β = −0.342; 95% CI = −0.463, −0.227; P = 0.006), and the prevalence of estazolam (β = −0.077; 95% CI = −0.124, −0.037; P = 0.009) post-publication. Conversely, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of zolpidem, after the criteria were released (β = 0.030; 95% CI = 0.002, 0.057; P = 0.036). Conclusions We found that the release of criteria for effectively identifying and managing PIM use has had a positive effect on its prevalence among older outpatients in China. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218290572,[WARNING:NoKeywords]

We determined burdens, incidence, evolution, and associated factors of long COVID-19 over two years among these groups. Methods We conducted a longitudinal cohort study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and recruited confirmed COVID-19 survivors from December 2020 to May 2021 (previously reported). 346 survivors underwent in-person follow-ups at five, nine, 18 months and two years post-infection. The assessment included long COVID symptoms, cardiorespiratory function, neuropsychiatric conditions, quality of life, and laboratory tests. The outcomes included one or more symptoms and/or signs indicative of long COVID, aligning closely with the World Health Organization definition of post-COVID-19 condition. Results Of the 346 participants, we included 326 in the analysis. 78% of HS (n/N=171/219) and 62% of NHS (n/N=55/89) reported at least one sequela symptom. HS had higher odds of palpitations, headaches, dizziness, sleeping difficulties, brain fog, muscle weakness, joint pain, hypertension, insulin requirement, poor quality of life, and prolonged corrected QT intervals on electrocardiogram compared to NHS at two years (95% confidence interval (CI)>1). Regarding evolution, sequelae-symptoms, neurological outcomes, restrictive spirometry findings, and electrocardiogram abnormalities remained unchanged, although psychiatric sequelae, quality of life, and exercise capacity improved in both groups. Hospital readmission rates significantly increased (P<0.05). The incidence rates of palpitations, cough, and hypertension were higher in HS compared to NHS (95% CI>1). Two or more vaccine doses decreased the risk of respiratory (adjusted risk ratio (aRR)=0.76; 95% CI=0.63–0.91) and psychiatric sequelae (aRR=0.78; 95% CI=0.66–0.92) than one or no doses. Conclusions COVID-19 survivors, particularly HS, experienced a higher burden of persistent symptoms and health issues two years after infection. However, vaccination significantly reduced the risk of respiratory and psychiatric outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of ongoing vaccination programs and the need for targeted rehabilitation services in low-resource settings. © 2025 The Author(s)",,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000290782,2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Longitudinal Study; Pandemic
"H.M., Sinclair, Hugh M.",The vitamin B complex,1941,Postgraduate Medical Journal,10.1136/pgmj.17.183.3,"1. Four members of the vitamin B complex are believed to be important in human nutrition: vitamin B1, nicotinic acid, riboflavin and vitamin B6. All have been synthesized. 2. Deficiency of vitamin B1 causes disorders of the nervous and cardio-vascular systems which in their extreme forms constitute beriberi. The symptoms and signs of deficiency are briefly described. The causes of deficiency are discussed, and the frequency of mild states of deficiency in this country is emphasized. 3. Nicotinic acid cures pellagra-a disease found more commonly in this country than is generally supposed; the symptoms and nature of the disease are briefly discussed. 4. Deficiency of riboflavin causes cheilosis and seborrhcea around the nose. 5. There is an ill-defined relation between the vitamin B complex and anaemia. 6. The members of the vitamin B complex are probably parts of enzymes or coenzymes necessary for the respiration of ceVtain cells. In their absence the metabolism of the cell becomes deranged. Yeast is a convenient therapeutic source of the vitamin B complex. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906418107,[WARNING:NoKeywords]
"D.C., Hare, Dorothy C.",Therapeutic Observations on Non-specific Colitis,1935,Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,10.1177/003591573502900103,"The clinical characteristics of non-specific colitis and its tendency to spontaneous recovery and relapse make it difficult to assess the results of treatment, but no treatment has been found that acts as a specific cure in an acute attack or which will prevent relapse. The tissues of the colon are highly sensitive to trauma in colitis; treatment by colon lavage therefore often does harm and surgical procedures involving local manipulation are contra-indicated in acute colitis. Antidysenteric serum and Bargen's streptococcal serum and vaccine do not appear to produce a specific curative reaction, and their effect is uncertain. A generous well-balanced diet promotes recovery in convalescence, and long hours of fasting or scanty diet favour relapse. Experimental diets deficient in vitamin B complex produce colitis in monkeys, but in this country diet deficiencies do not appear to be the cause of human colitis, and a complete diet does not protect from relapse. Liver therapy has been found of no value in either acute or chronic colitis, except in a single case with a macrocytic anæmia. Iron in large doses given in chronic colitis with hypochromic anæmia is of striking benefit. Atropine has been used successfully to relieve spasm of the colon causing colic and fœcal constipation. © 1935, The Royal Society of Medicine.
